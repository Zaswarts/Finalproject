COVID loneliness crisis – here's how you can fight this pandemic side effect,"Nicole Saphier, M.D."," March 15, 2022 2:00pm EDT","  close     Video   CDC has done a ‘disservice’ to Americans’: Nicole Saphier    Fox News medical contributor tells ‘America Reports’ that the CDC ‘is not a leader when it comes to public health.’ NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Being lonely is the  feeling of being alone , regardless of how much social contact someone has. It can affect us all – young, old and in between – and at any point in life. Nearly two years ago,  nationwide stay-at-home measures , subsequent business closures and the start of what came to be a perpetual state of fear imposed by media and public health entities took hold of America. Overnight, it turned usually active cities like NYC into ghost towns, leaving people with some level of social isolation for the next two years.     
      
       (iStock) As  the New York Times  recently pointed out, this was done with little benefit as stay-at-home orders had no measurable long-term effect on overall reduction of COVID-19 case counts and viral transmission. What did occur though is the fueling of an existing loneliness crisis of which the consequences are only now beginning to be seen. COVID LOCKDOWN LESSONS LEARNED – FAUCI AMENDMENT WOULD MEAN NO MORE HEALTH ‘DICTATOR IN CHIEF’ Early in the pandemic, in April 2020, 53% of Americans said they felt lonely or isolated within the past week – an increase from the year before. More recently, now in 2022, citywide health surveys in NYC found that 67% felt socially isolated in the prior four weeks.   Video Countless research has been published on the negative health effects of loneliness and social isolation, including inflammation and elevated stress hormones that can result in many bodily diseases. This week, the CDC released a report linking social isolation with a 50% increased risk of dementia, a 29% increased risk of heart disease and a 32% increased risk of stroke. Public health entities have a responsibility to Americans to broaden access to resources to combat the loneliness epidemic, but there are things we as individuals can do too. Humans are social beings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our natural tendencies.   Give yourself a break:  If you aren’t being kind to yourself, you aren’t giving reason for others to be either. Blaming yourself won’t help you out of feeling lonely but encouraging yourself and getting to the best place mentally and physically can. Stop with the unkind self-talk and take care of yourself. Remember, everyone flops, and there is no need to feel bad about it when you do.  Be nicer to yourself by practicing kinder self-talk, getting better sleep, spending more time outdoors, improving your diet and buying yourself a treat occasionally. All of this can help boost the much-needed vitamins, minerals and hormones your body needs to focus on feeling less lonely.   Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Be kind to others:  Doing things for others can increase serotonin levels, the hormone responsible for feelings of satisfaction and happiness. Also, like exercise, helping others also releases endorphins, which can reduce stress and improve sleep. So, consider volunteering, buying someone lunch or donating to a worthy cause. Not only are you helping others, but you are also helping yourself. Engage in person with people:  Interacting with people face-to-face can improve our mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Activities that involve other people, like going to church, sports activities and other community gatherings can increase a sense of belonging with positive effects on our mental health.   Video Refocus online presence:  Rather than passively browsing social media, do something that involves active (healthy) participation with other people. Trolling and criticizing others does not count. What I am talking about is playing online games, like chess, with another person. Consider joining a forum or comment on content you have an interest in. The more you interact with others while online, the more connected you can feel. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Spend wisely:  Instead of spending money online shopping for the latest clothes, digital accessory or what-not, refocus your money to savings and experiences. Buying the latest trend has short-lived excitement but placing money in savings and using it for an experience can have a lasting impact. Experiences can be as small as attending a museum, going to the theater or as big as skydiving, travel. The sky truly is the limit. Spending money on experiences is much better for our mental health and who knows, you may make a friend while doing it. Humans are social beings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our natural tendencies. The long-term consequences on our health will be extreme. Before it’s too late, refocus and engage in quality social relationships to improve your chances of living a longer, healthier life. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR. NICOLE SAPHIER  "
Republicans go for kill shot on COVID transportation mask mandates: 'About time',Tyler Olson," March 15, 2022 2:09pm EDT","  close     Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for March 15   Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

   Most  Americans  no longer need to wear masks in  schools  or public places, and Senate Republicans Tuesday pushed for an end to one of the most far-reaching  COVID-19  mask mandates left – transportation. ""I've got a crazy idea. The American people should have the same mask rules that members of Congress had at the State of the Union address,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said. ""Just two weeks ago, we saw 535 members of Congress sitting on the floor of the House. I don't think there were five masks among them,"" Cruz continued. ""Joe Biden didn't have a mask. Kamala Harris didn't have a mask. Nancy Pelosi didn't have a mask."" State and local governments lifted nearly all kinds of mask mandates in the past month as the winter omicron wave of the virus receded. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also loosened its mask recommendations – a move some  Republicans alleged  had more to do with the upcoming midterms than any change in the science.  RAND PAUL TO INTRODUCE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE ‘PETTY TYRANT’ FAUCI FROM HIS POSITION AS NIAID DIRECTOR But President Biden last week nevertheless extended the federal transportation mask mandate. This affected Americans riding in airplanes, commuter trains, and in buildings connected to such forms of transportation as train stations and airports.  Cruz and a handful of other Senate Republicans attacked that extension Tuesday as unnecessary and not supported by the science.  ""The current mandate was set to expire on March 18,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said. ""We were satisfied with that… Unfortunately for whatever reason, it certainly was not a scientific reason, the Biden administration chose not to listen to the science and decided to extend the mask mandate for another month.""

MAKARY: COVID VIRUS ‘BEHAVING LESS DANGEROUS’ THAN TRADITIONAL FLU If the Biden administration rolls back the federal transportation mask mandate, for many Americans it would effectively remove the last mask or COVID-related mandate they're forced to comply with as part of their daily lives.  At the recommendation of the CDC, the Biden administration announced last week the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) mask mandate will extend through at least April 18. It was set to expire on Friday of this week.

More than 965,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, compared to nearly 80 million confirmed cases of the virus.  But the proliferation of available vaccines for the past year, plus an increasing number of Americans with a previous infection after the omicron wave, appear to be reducing case counts and hospitalizations significantly since the winter.  ""I wonder why they want to control peoples' lives, in airports and in airplanes,"" Wicker said of the mask mandates.

10 biggest COVID mistakes – Americans deserve an apology from the medical experts,Dr. Marty Makary," March 16, 2022 5:00am EDT","  close     Video   Dr. Makary: COVID virus 'behaving less dangerous' than traditional flu   Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary says that a new report reveals that vaccinated immunity as well as natural immunity has reduced the mortality by about 90% and that omicron is now considered less virulent intrinsically than certain flu strains. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The medical establishment has  marched in lockstep on COVID-19 , presenting a consensus of expertise as they marginalized physicians who had different opinions. Two years into the pandemic, it’s fair to ask, how did public health officials do?  Surface transmission   Wash your hands like crazy (at least 20 seconds) and pour alcohol-based solutions on your grocery bags to stop COVID transmission, you were told for months. Despite being an expert,  Dr. Anthony Fauci  immediately applied the influenza surface transmission model to COVID. The logical starting hypothesis should have been that COVID was aerosolized.      
      Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, participates in the White House COVID-19 Response Team's regular call with the National Governors Association on the White House campus on Dec. 27, 2021.
       (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) There are only three coronaviruses that cause serious illness in humans:  SARS, MERS and COVID . SARS and MERS spread by air. Why did Dr. Fauci think COVID was so different? The NIH could have done the definitive experiment in one day to get the answer. It’s OK to be wrong in science, but not for months when the National Institutes of Health could have spent a fraction of its $42 billion budget to instantly establish how COVID spreads.   No hospital visitation   The barbaric policy of banning loved ones from holding the hand of their dying loved one and saying goodbye was a human rights violation that spanned much of the pandemic. All the so-called experts and the medical establishment were complicit, allowing this cruel policy to be instituted while abandoning their duty to respect the dignity of human life. As a physician, I can assure you there are things worse than dying.  COVID LOCKDOWN LESSONS LEARNED – FAUCI AMENDMENT WOULD MEAN NO MORE HEALTH ‘DICTATOR IN CHIEF’   Video Closing schools   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention argued they were using science to close schools, but many private schools and most schools in Florida and other states remained open throughout (with no difference COVID outcomes). The CDC director initially said schools were safe but was swiftly corrected by the White House the following day. It later came out that the teachers’ unions had made edits to the draft school closure policy before it was issued (kids did not have a chance to make edits). Now studies are revealing the catastrophic harm to a generation of children – significant motor and cognitive declines and a mental health crisis. In Baltimore, many kids never logged on to virtual learning and were never seen in class again.    Video Ignoring natural immunity   Ironically, when public health officials insisted that those who had natural immunity be fired for not being vaccinated, they fired those least likely to spread the infection in the workplace.  Drs. Fauci and Rochelle Walensky never talked about natural immunity and instead created the imprecise construct of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. In reality, most unvaccinated Americans have antibodies that neutralized the virus, but they are antibodies that the government did not recognize. Eventually the data came in. Natural immunity was 2.8 times better in preventing hospitalization than vaccinated immunity and having both meant you had the same protection as natural immunity alone.  The singular focus on vaccines meant that little attention was paid to lifesaving therapeutics.   Downplaying therapeutics   The singular focus on vaccines meant that little attention was paid to lifesaving therapeutics. For example, Paxlovid is an antiviral medication that reduced COVID deaths to zero in the clinical trial, yet not enough has been produced. Fluvoxamine, an $10 anti-depressant medication that has been available for years, was found in two reputable studies to reduce COVID death, up to 91% in the latest study (no study suggests it’s not effective). Yet, few doctors are aware of these data because our public health officials have never talked about Fluvoxamine.  Not spacing out vaccine doses   Spacing out vaccine doses makes a vaccine more effective and lowers the side effect profile. It also would have allowed the U.S. to save more lives when we were rationing a scarce vaccine supply. Yet public health officials dismissed pleas to space out the doses as many of us called for.    Video Ironically, just three weeks ago, after 250 million Americans received the vaccine, the CDC finally changed their guidance to recommend longer intervals between doses. The CDC acknowledged it was to reduce serious adverse effects such as myocarditis. Myocarditis is now recognized to occur in 1 in 1,862 young males after the second vaccine dose.  Cloth masks   The U.S. remains an international outlier by masking toddlers. At this point the only people in America still forced to wear masks are children, waiters, servers and staff. The NIH could have funded researchers to properly study each mask type in the first 10 days of the pandemic, but they failed to pivot funding to do so. Current data suggests that covering the faces of children for two years with a cloth mask had zero benefit and some harm.    Video Promising no vaccines mandates, then breaking it   This was a stated promise made by President Biden, Fauci and many others – a social contract. They then broke their promise insisting that any unvaccinated workers, regardless of their risk or natural immunity, be fired. They demanded that soldiers be dishonorably discharged and nurses be laid off in the middle of a staffing crisis.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This policy ignited a debate over civil liberties, which ultimately divided the country and hardened many toward the idea of vaccination. At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration has been delinquent in authorizing the Covaxin and Novavax vaccines, which use traditional vaccine technology.    Video Downplaying a lab leak   A bombshell investigation by ""Special Report"" host Bret Baier of Fox News revealed that prominent U.S. virologists told Drs. Fauci and Francis Collins of their concern that the virus may have been manipulated and originated in the lab, but then suddenly changed their tune in public comments days after meeting with the NIH officials. The virologists were later awarded nearly $9 million from Fauci’s agency.  Boosters for young people   Two top FDA officials quit in protest because of political pressure to approve boosters in young people. The FDA issued the authorization by not convening their Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee – a highly unusual break from historic precedent.  A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the mortality risk of an un-boosted person under age 30 was zero. You can’t lower a risk of zero any further with a booster.    Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Throughout the pandemic, all COVID decisions were made by a small group of like-minded government doctors who often replaced the scientific method with medical dogma. They had tremendous influence over medical universities, scientific journals and medical societies. In fact, nearly all of these entities received funding from Drs. Fauci and Collins and from Big Pharma. It’s no surprise, then, that with one united voice, the leaders of these organizations joined the groupthink bandwagon as the media parroted whatever they said.   At this point, the everyday Americans who paid the price for the errors of the medical establishment can evaluate their performance.  This partial list of catastrophic errors begs for a complete overhaul of our health agencies. The American people, and children in particular, deserve an apology.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR. MARTY MAKARY  "

   Novak Djokovic will be allowed to play at the  French Open  even if he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 as long as the coronavirus situation in France remains stable, organizers said Wednesday. Russian tennis players, including top-ranked Daniil Medvedev, will also be admitted to play in the tournament but as neutral athletes because of the war started by their country in neighboring Ukraine. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM       Organizers said there is nothing at the moment preventing Djokovic from defending his title at the clay-court Grand Slam. France this week lifted measures requiring the need to wear face masks in most settings and allowing people who aren’t vaccinated back into restaurants, sports arenas and other venues. ""At this stage there is nothing to stop him returning to the courts,"" French Open director Amelie Mauresmo said at a news conference. Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after a legal battle over whether he should be allowed to enter the country, forcing him to miss the Australian Open. He told the BBC last month that he was willing to miss upcoming Grand Slam tournaments as well if they required him to get vaccinated. Djokovic has won the French Open twice and has a total of 20 major titles, one short of the record held by Rafael Nadal after the Spaniard won this year's Australian Open.

       French tennis federation president Gilles Moretton said that although Djokovic is now free to play, French authorities might be forced to introduce new restrictions if the virus situation deteriorates before the tournament starts on May 22. ""It is not up to us,"" Moretton said. ""Today there is a little virus that is going around. We are quite confident that the lights are green, but we are all cautious about what has happened over the last two years."" Asked whether Russian tennis players will be allowed to compete at the tournament in the light of the war in Ukraine, organizers said they plan to stick to decisions suspending Russia and ally Belarus but allowing their players to compete as neutral athletes. The seven groups that run the sport around the world have condemned the war; canceled events in Russia and Belarus; kicked those two nations out of the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup team competitions; and announced on March 1 that players from those countries will be allowed to compete in WTA, ATP and Grand Slam tournaments but not under the name or flag of Russia or Belarus.

   The University of  Florida  has completed an investigation into claims that university or state officials used pressure to destroy or prevent access to state  COVID-19  data, finding that the allegations were meritless. The investigation, conducted by the school's Office of the Vice President for Research and the Office of Compliance and Ethics, was launched after a December 2021 report from the UF Faculty Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Freedom. That report alleged that researchers at UF's Gainesville campus felt external pressure to destroy data and faced ""barriers"" to accessing, analyzing and publishing their findings.

Video The letter said that the investigation included interviews and reviews of various documents which led the investigation committee to believe that the accusations were likely based on an October 2020 incident where a Florida Department of Health representative ""expressed concerns regarding UF's use and management of FDOH data that was gathered exclusively for use in FDOH public health surveillance (PHS) activities.""

""I think the primary cause of this bout of pricing increases starts with COVID. And the fact that we have supply chain kinks and that people rapidly shifted the demand curves so that demand for services went down and demand for goods went up. So those two forced prices up, that’s part one,"" Warren said. She went on to explain how certain industries including the meat industry and grocery chains are fixing prices to expand their profits. ""What has also happened is that now that we’re living in America where there’s a lot more concentration in certain industries, look at the oil industry, look at the meat industry, look at groceries generally. What’s happened is that these companies have said ‘you know, we’ll pass along costs, but while we’re at it and everyone’s talking about rising costs let’s just add an extra big dollop of cost increases to expand our profits,’"" Warren said. ""Part one, yes, very much the pandemic. Part two, companies that recognize that because they don’t face a lot of competition can goose those prices up,"" she told Mathisen.

       (AP Photo/LM Otero) Warren has frequently attacked major industries and corporate greed as the source behind increasing costs and inflation. In  November , she called for an investigation into the poultry industry for anti-competitive practices that could explain rising turkey costs. In December, she  accused  grocery store chains of exploiting the pandemic to raise prices and increase profit. INDIANA FACTORY LOSES 7% OF WORKFORCE IN TWO WEEKS DUE TO HIGH GAS PRICES: ‘TOO FAR TO DRIVE’   Although various industries have cited supply-chain issues behind the higher costs,  President Biden  and his administration have since adopted Warren’s messaging and are now blaming oil companies for rising gas prices.     
      Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon.

Uptick in Covid virus cases detected in wastewater sample sites: CDC,Amy McGorry," March 16, 2022 6:59pm EDT","  close     Video   Dr. Makary: COVID virus 'behaving less dangerous' than traditional flu   Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary says that a new report reveals that vaccinated immunity as well as natural immunity has reduced the mortality by about 90% and that omicron is now considered less virulent intrinsically than certain flu strains. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   COVID-19 virus  detected in wastewater sampling sites is on the rise, according Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. The trend comes as the country recently began lifting mask mandates and easing pandemic restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Of the 398 current wastewater sampling sites with active data, 44 sites saw an increase of 1000% or more in detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater levels and 62 sites saw a 100% to 999% percent increase, during the period of Feb 26, 2022 – Mar 12, 2022, according to the  CDC COVID data tracker .

       REPUBLICANS GO FOR KILL SHOT ON COVID TRANSPORTATION MASK MANDATES: 'ABOUT TIME' Dr. Aaron Glatt, who serves as the Chief of Infectious Diseases and is an epidemiologist at Mount Sinai South Nassau on Long Island, New York, told Fox News one reason for the uptick could be due to a coronavirus variant. ""We definitely are seeing an increase across our region, across our country, and indeed across the world, of the BA.2 omicron variant."" Glatt who is also the Chair of the Department of Medicine and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America also told Fox News, ""This probably explains the uptick of cases and the presence of higher values in the wastewater. Whether it presages more cases and hospitalizations in the near future - we will find out in a week or two."" Glatt also noted, ""We do believe that this strain is more contagious albeit it is not causing more severe illness."" OMICRON BA.2 SUB-VARIANT SPREADING IN NEW YORK CITY The CDC confirmed Tuesday, the increased detection of the coronavirus in sewage surveillance systems, after a recent report in  Bloomberg  stated that more than a third of the CDC’s wastewater sample sites across the U.S. showed rising Covid-19 trends during the time frame from March 1 to March 10.     
      A sample analysis of a wastewater sample with evidence of viral genes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be seen on a monitor in a laboratory at the Institute of Hygiene and Health on March 3, 2022 in Hamburg, Germany. In a model project, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 is to be monitored in wastewater over a period of one year.
       (Photo by Daniel Reinhardt/picture alliance via Getty Images) Although  health  officials have said the number of reported cases of COVID-19 have remained at a recent low, the number of sewage surveillance sites with rising Covid-19 cases nearly doubled from what it was during the Feb. 1 to Feb. 10 period, when the highly contagious omicron variant began to wane, according to the media report. During the period of March 1 to March 10, more than one-third (36%) of the sites saw an increase in detection of the virus, which was more than twice the number of wastewater sample sites (15%) that were seeing a rise from Feb. 1 to Feb. 10, according to the Bloomberg analysis. Amy Kirby, who is the program lead for the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) at CDC, acknowledged to the media outlet that although there is an uptick in sites seeing an increase, the wastewater levels are generally very low. Kirby said in a statement to the media outlet, ""These bumps may simply reflect minor increase from very low levels to still low levels."" PFIZER-BIONTECH SEEK AUTHORIZATION FOR SECOND COVID-19 BOOSTER Kirby was also quoted as saying, ""Some communities though may be starting to see an increase in Covid-19 infections, as preventions strategies in many states have changed in recent weeks.""     
      In wastewater, the development of the coronavirus pandemic can be reliably predicted. TU Darmstadt, a public German university, is one of only two reference laboratories for the sequencing of wastewater samples in Europe, analyzing samples from about 50 wastewater treatment plants from all over Europe and coordinates the two Hessian pilot projects in Frankfurt and Wiesbaden.

This RNA can be detected in community wastewater, which includes water from household or building use such as showers, sinks and toilets that can contain human fecal waste. It also collects water from  rain  and industrial use. The wastewater is collected from a treatment plan and samples are tested for the virus. The data is reported by health departments to the CDC, the federal health agency  explained  on its website.

The results are available to the public through  CDC’s COVID Data Tracker . Health officials told Fox News said this type of wastewater surveillance could be an early indicator if the number of individuals with COVID-19 in a community is increasing or decreasing.  "

   In recent times,  critical race theory  (CRT) has come under increasing scrutiny. If there is a silver lining in  the COVID-19 crisis  over the past two years, it's that  American parents  have seen firsthand, via their children's online classes, how public schools have pushed a radical agenda that includes CRT (whether it's actually called that by schools or not). Now, a new documentary ""Whose Children Are They?"" reveals the issue in detail. ""Whose Children Are They?: Exposing the Hidden Agenda in America’s Schools,"" shines a light on ""the need to return to the original intent of education, not indoctrination,"" as Fathom Events, the project’s distributor, points out on its website.      
      ""Whose Children Are They?"" opens March 14. Fox News Digital spoke with a producer of the documentary, as well as with others.
       (WCAT LLC) With the premise that ""public education is the most important domestic issue facing America today,"" the documentary is opening in select theaters on March 14, for one night only.  It calls on parents, teachers and others to partner together ""for the innocence and well-being of our children."" ""The so-called teacher unions and their political allies are heavily pushing CRT in our K-12 schools, colleges and universities.""   ""I’d like parents to understand that the root problem in our schools is the so-called teachers’ unions and their radical agenda — not good teachers,"" Rebecca Friedrichs, a producer on the project and a cast member, told Fox News Digital in an interview earlier this week. The mother of two grown boys, Friedrichs is co-founder of For Kids and Country, a national movement of parents, teachers and citizens who want to restore the culture in public schools.       
      A new documentary opening on March 14, 2022 reveals exactly what's going on in America's public schools. Shown here: a still from the movie, presented by Fathom Events.

CRT is ubiquitous in America, noted Friedrichs ahead of the documentary's debut. ""The so-called teacher unions and their political allies are heavily pushing CRT in our K-12 schools, colleges and universities,"" she said.  ""It is imbedded in curricula, teacher trainings, school cultures and especially through Obama-era racial equity discipline policies that have turned our classrooms into war zones.""      
      ""Good teachers reject CRT,"" Rebecca Friedrichs told Fox News Digital, ""because it teaches children to judge their peers [based] on the color of their skin instead of the content of their character."" Shown here is another still from the documentary ""Whose Children Are They?"" opening March 14.
       (WCAT LLC) Friedrichs also said, ""The education establishment wants teachers to weave CRT into every subject. But good teachers reject CRT because it teaches children to judge their peers [based] on the color of their skin instead of the content of their character."" BETO O'ROURKE OF TEXAS COMES OUT AGAINST CRT IN SCHOOLS   Friedrichs added, ""My students and I always celebrated that we were living  Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream  because we had students from all over the world in our class, but we all respected one another.""  ""We were a true melting pot. Unions and their allies seek to divide us all with CRT. Beware: CRT is presented under a score of other titles.""     
      A still is shown here from ""Whose Children Are They?"" The release of the new documentary comes as public school enrollment in the U.S. is declining.
       (WCAT LLC) Her lawsuit, Friedrichs v. California Teachers’ Association, brought with 10 others, was argued before the United States Supreme Court in 2016 and ""blazed the trail for ending forced unionism for all teachers and government employees."" MAJORITY OF PARENTS BELIEVE DISTANCE LEARNING CAUSED KIDS TO FALL BEHIND IN SCHOOL, SURVEY FINDS ""If parents will stand with good teachers and help them to reject the unions, we can restore our schools,"" explained Friedrichs. ""The unions are the culprits behind undermining parents, indoctrinating children, pushing an anti-American agenda, destroying our once outstanding educational system and more.""   Video A former California public school teacher, Friedrichs is the author of ""Standing Up to Goliath.""  Friedrichs also noted that while teachers are no longer forced to fund unions, many are either unaware or too afraid to leave unions that ""control teachers in a culture of fear.""  Public school enrollment declines The release of ""Whose Children Are They?"" comes as public school enrollment nationwide is declining.      
      A new documentary exposes an agenda of many public schools in America.
       (WCAT LLC) The number of reported students attending public schools in the U.S. in 2020-2021 fell by 3 percent, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The state of Washington, for example, lost 40,000 public schoolchildren during the 2020-2021 school year, as Katy Payne, communications director at the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), verified to Fox News Digital. ‘White students’ judged 'for crimes they didn’t commit' ""Critical race theory judges white students for crimes they didn’t commit, burdening them with an irredeemable guilt based solely on the color of their skin,"" Maxford Nelsen, director of Labor Policy at the Freedom Foundation, in Olympia, Washington, told Fox News Digital.  ""Zoom school gave parents an unprecedented look at government school curriculum, and many were horrified by the overt racism and political propaganda broadcast into their homes.""   The national nonprofit organization works to advance the principles of individual liberty, free enterprise and limited, accountable government. It is fighting to reverse the undue influence of government unions. ""To students of color, critical race theory preaches lies that the system is so pervasively rigged against them that all they can do is participate in the left’s nihilistic revolution to destroy America as we know it,"" added Nelsen.      
      Here is another still from the new documentary ""Whose Children Are They?"" opening on March 14, 2022.
       (WCAT LLC) ""In the process, it deprives them of the agency to achieve their dreams and fulfill their God-given potential.""  (Of note: When Rebecca Friedrichs’ case reached the Supreme Court in 2015, the Freedom Foundation filed an amicus brief on her behalf.) ""Gov. [Jay] Inslee’s draconian response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cheered on by the Washington Education Association teachers’ union, kept far too many kids out of school for far too long,"" Nelsen of the Freedom Foundation also said.  ‘COVID-19 BY COUNTY’ TOOL HELPS PROVIDE GUIDELINES BY AREA ""The failure of our state’s government schools to continue to provide adequate education is certainly a big reason so many parents turned to alternatives that better met their family’s need,"" he said. ""They use the tactics of CRT to divide Americans and to create a culture of envy and blame.""   He added, ""For other families, Zoom school gave parents an unprecedented look at government school curriculum, and many were horrified by the overt racism and political propaganda being broadcast into their homes."" Notable cast members  ""Critical race theory is dividing our children in ways that are unacceptable,"" Carol Swain, Ph.D., a former tenured professor at Princeton and Vanderbilt universities, says in the documentary.      
      Dr. Carol Swain, shown during a recent appearance on the Fox News Channel, is among those featured in ""Whose Children Are They?""

Pollack is also the founder of the nonprofit Americans for Children’s Lives and School Safety (CLASS).  What parents need to know ""It is important to understand that the ‘teacher unions’ are masquerading as teachers and unions,"" Friedrichs pointed out.  In her opinion, ""They bully good teachers, silence our voices and use Mafia tactics to keep us in line."" ""Parents are more engaged and paying more attention to their school boards [now] than at any time in recent history.""   She also said, ""Unions promote CRT and other radical ideologies because they are political action committees for the left. They are transmission belts of socialism and communism."" CRITICAL RACE THEORY REVEALS ‘A LOT OF LOST AMERICANS’ She added, ""They use the tactics of CRT to divide Americans and to create a culture of envy and blame. They desire to upend our free republic, American traditions, and capitalism and to replace them with socialism, communism and atheism.""  However, on a positive note, the Freedom Foundation's Nelson noted, ""Parents are more engaged and paying more attention to their school boards and government education officials [now] than at any time in recent history.""

COVID lockdown lessons learned – Fauci amendment would mean no more health 'dictator in chief',Sen. Rand Paul," March 14, 2022 2:00am EDT","  close     Video    Rand Paul: Dr. Fauci's claim lockdowns saved millions is false   Senate Health Committee member reacts to a new study that concludes COVID lockdowns did more harm than good on 'America Reports.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   This week marks the two-year anniversary of the  COVID lockdowns . I join the American people in mourning the lives lost to this virus. I also mourn those we lost to the crushing and overbearing lockdowns and mandates that were based on junk science.  The toll of COVID doesn’t stop there. We lost more than individuals. We lost our freedoms. Our liberties. Our vibrant small town Main Streets. Our  children’s growth and learning . For two years our lives were held captive by petty tyrants and power-hungry bureaucrats.      
      Dr. Anthony Fauci testifies before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Nov. 4, 2021, in Washington.
       (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) We’ve learned a lot over the past two years, but one lesson in particular is that no one person should be deemed "" dictator in chief ."" No one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of Americans.   COVID LOCKDOWNS MAY BE ENDING, BUT WE ARE FOREVER CHANGED To ensure that ineffective, unscientific lockdowns and mandates are never foisted on the American people ever again, I will introduce an amendment to eliminate Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and divide his power into three separate new institutes.      Video Each of these three institutes will be led by a director who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. This will create accountability and oversight into a taxpayer-funded position that has largely abused its power and has been responsible for many failures and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.   No one person should have the sole authority to dictate science, especially when that one person wasn’t ever following the science. I’ve said that from the beginning, and I’ve been proven right over, and over, and over again. On masks, lockdowns, schools, natural immunity, all of it.   Why did we spend two years not following the science?    A rational person might ask, how in the world did it take us so long to get to the truth? Why did we spend two years not following the science?  Well again, that’s what happens when ""the science"" is dictated by one man, an unelected bureaucrat with far too much power.  The country is still reeling from the economic fallout of the lockdowns, which didn’t work. A group of researchers at Johns Hopkins University released a report confirming that. The report is an extensive analysis looking at dozens and dozens of studies, which comes to the conclusion that lockdowns did not reduce mortality but were devastating to the economy.     Video Perhaps the biggest victims of the lockdowns were our children.   All across the country, millions of kids haven’t experienced a normal school day since the beginning of 2020. Whether it be virtual learning, having to wear masks all day, being separated by plexiglass, mandatory vaccinations, weekly or daily testing, canceled extracurricular activities, sports, and events, nothing is normal and it’s scarring our children.   According to the CDC, between March and October 2020, hospital emergency department volume for mental health visits for kids ages 12 to 17 increased 31% compared to the same period the year before. We also saw a 24% increase for ages 5 to 11 over the same time period.    Video And it only got worse in 2021, in emergency rooms in 38 children’s hospitals across the United States, the number of suicide and self-injury cases in the first nine months of 2021 was 47% higher among children ages 5 to 8, and 182% higher among kids ages 9 to 12, all compared to 2016 data.   But it wasn’t just lockdowns that affected kids. It was also the notion that they MUST wear a mask for eight hours a day that also created psychological issues and inhibited communication between students and teachers.    Keeping kids out of school clearly did far more harm than good. And the same can be said for masks.     Video While the powers that be are just now starting to do away with mask mandates, we’ve known all along that cloth masks don’t work.   When Dr. Fauci said that cloth masks worked, I was truly concerned because that’s not what the science demonstrated. Misinformation can cost lives if the government convinces 80-year-olds to wear useless cloth masks while taking care of spouses with COVID.   Dr. Fauci caused people to engage in activities they wouldn’t have normally by telling them it was safe when masked when it wasn’t. I tried to sound the alarm, but I was censored by YouTube and my videos were taken down. (""If Dr. Fauci says masks work, it must be true!"" the fake-news fact-checkers all screamed in unison.)    Video Dr. Fauci and his friends worked diligently to silence opposing views. The media amplified his efforts. We were branded conspiracy theorists and anti-science for simply asking questions and presenting alternatives to what had been delivered to the American people as ""fact.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER I’ve been a physician for over 33 years. In all my years studying and practicing medicine, I had never encountered someone with the gall to proclaim himself ""the science"" and portray anyone opposing him as ""attacking science."" That is, until Dr. Fauci became the COVID dictator-in-chief.  If Fauci was simply one family doctor in Peoria, his mistakes would not be so catastrophic. But since Fauci is allowed to be a medical czar for the whole country, his errors are amplified throughout the land.      Video When Fauci misinforms the public that cloth masks work, he risks the health of anyone who believes a cloth mask will protect them when caring for a spouse or relative with COVID.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When Fauci decides that he alone will define and fund dangerous ""gain-of-function"" research, his disregard for the possibility of a lab leak is felt worldwide.  The biggest lesson we have learned over the last two years is that no one person should have this much unchecked power.

   Among the greatest lies of the  COVID crisis , and it's a competitive category, high on the list was ""It’s not about politics."" In fact, with the exception of loss of life, there is nothing that was as deeply affected by the pandemic as our politics.   Not only did governors exert unprecedented emergency powers, not only did COVID dominate the  2020 presidential election , but it also fundamentally transformed how Americans participate in politics.

       As we mark two years since the onset of COVID, we need to think about what, if any elements, of our political life in the  midst of an emergency  we wish to make permanent features of American governance. Nowhere is this need more keen than in regard to the vast powers granted to the leaders of our states, some of which still linger.  COVID LOCKDOWNS MAY BE ENDING, BUT WE ARE FOREVER CHANGED With the stroke of a pen governors like New York’s Andrew Cuomo and California’s Gavin Newsome restricted the rights of their citizens to work, shop, go to church, go to school -- you name it they banned it. That precedent has now been set. Should anything, be it climate change, or racism or ""misinformation,"" rise to the murky level of emergency, can these dictatorial powers be seized again?     Video Unfortunately, at the moment the answer appears to be yes. Prior to 2020 we imagined emergency powers as temporary and targeted, a matter of weeks not years. That is simply no longer true. Today, there is a pressing need for every state to codify in limited and strict ways how their governors can use this dangerous precedent in the future.   It has been rightly said by many that COVID occurring in a presidential election year was the worst possible timing, and it is true. Perverse incentives abounded on all sides to paint the pandemic in the colors of politics not public health. It exacerbated an existing trend in America of elections as existential crises.     Video This is new. In 1996 nobody thought the outcome of Bill Clinton vs Bob Dole would seal the fate of America forever. Now that kind of sentiment is a regular feature of our never-ending campaign season. We failed as a nation to come together on COVID because we can’t come together on anything. There is no time anymore to govern, only time to plot out the next election.  And even elections themselves were not immune to COVID. Across the country states changed voting laws on the fly, often without the input of state legislatures, to keep people safe while voting. We saw enhanced early voting, mail-in ballots and drop boxes proliferate in the name of public health. Today, Democrats, who think these changes benefited them, are seeking to codify them going forward. Even though this effort has failed nationally, in many states they will absolutely succeed.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER    Arguably the COVID precedent poised to do the most damage to our political system barely involves the government at all. Rather, it is Big Tech and social media companies that took the opportunity of the pandemic to curate what political speech Americans are allowed to be exposed to.    Video Just days before the 2020 election, social media banned an accurate New York Post story about Hunter Biden. Just days after the election, Donald Trump was barred from Twitter.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The skids that led to these illiberal developments were greased by COVID hysteria. Once social media companies decided that censoring COVID information, even from scientists, was part of their duty to protect Americans, it was a short jump to ""protecting"" us from ""dangerous"" political speech.  The long story short is that the short story is long. The significant upheavals in our political life brought on by just two years of COVID will become permanent features if we do not quickly address and redress the excesses.

   Hundreds of inmates in  New Jersey  prisons were released early over the weekend as part of a program to alleviate crowding in correctional facilities in the relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The 852 prisoners were granted early release as part of the ""Public Health Emergency Credits"" law enacted in October 2020, which gives certain  prisoners  credit for 122 days for each month served during a public health emergency.  More than 6,000 inmates have been released thus far. On Feb. 10, the state Department of Corrections released 262 inmates. FOX NATION REVEALS JIMMY HOFFA COULD BE BURIED UNDER NJ BRIDGE AS SEARCH CONTINUES The shorter prison sentences don't apply to everyone. First, an eligible inmate must be within 365 days of their scheduled crease date to qualify.  Those convicted of sex crimes or convicted of violent crimes such as murder are not eligible.  Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has said the legislation was a much-needed way to combat  COVID-19  and reduce the prison population. The law has the support of criminal justice advocates and some Democrats, including former Gov. Jim McGreevey, now the executive director of the New Jersey Reentry Services Corporation, which provides employment services to inmates.  The state's prison population decreased by 40% during the first 11 months after he signed the measure into law.  ""At its heart, the public health emergency credits law is not a pandemic policy,"" the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey said in a Monday news release. ""It’s a policy about humanity."" Not everyone agrees. The New Jersey Law Enforcement Supervisors Association, the union that represents correctional officers in the state, said the law doesn't make sense since there were low amounts of viral transmission of COVID in prisons.  ""The governor's actions are not making New Jersey's streets, towns, and cities any safer,"" William Lanoza, the union's president, said told Patch. ""In fact, the murder rate in New Jersey climbed 23 percent in 2021, reaching the highest it has been since 2016. The vast majority of inmates that are being released under this legislation are being bussed to our state's urban centers and thereafter left to themselves."" On the same say the 26w inmates were released in February, Republican state Sen. Joseph Pennacchio called on Murphy to terminate the public health emergency.

   From all across  France , protesters angry over pandemic restrictions drove toward Paris Friday in scattered convoys of camper vans, cars and trucks in an effort to defy a police ban and blockade the French capital. Waving French flags and shouting ""freedom,"" the protesters organized online, galvanized in part by truckers who have blockaded  Canada’s  capital and blocked border crossings. The French action has no single leader or goal, and comes as months of protests against French government vaccination rules have been waning.     
      People wave to a convoy departing for Paris, Friday, Feb.11, 2022 in Strasbourg, eastern France. Authorities in France and Belgium have banned road blockades threatened by groups organizing online against COVID-19 restrictions. The events are in part inspired by protesters in Canada.
           
      People applaud a convoy departing for Paris, Friday, Feb.11, 2022 in Strasbourg, eastern France.
       Armored police vehicles, riot police vans and more than 7,000 police officers were deployed at tollbooths around  Paris , the glamorous Champs-Elysee avenue and other key sites to try to prevent a blockade. Police stopped and checked select vehicles and threatened heavy fines and other punishments for those who defy the protest ban, which authorities said was necessary to prevent ""risk to public order."" Railing against the vaccination pass that France requires to enter restaurants and many other venues, protesters weaved toward Paris from north, south, east and west, waving and honking at onlookers from their car windows. Some convoys sought to avoid police detection by traveling local roads instead of the major highways leading into the capital.

A French far right leader, Florian Philippot, sought to use the global attention to the Canadian trucker protest to reinvigorate his own small movement, which has been holding weekly rallies against vaccination rules and centrist President Emmanuel Macron for months. ""You put armored vehicles in front of the people ... Free France isn’t armored vehicles, it’s (freedom) convoys,"" he told a rally in southern Paris on Friday, where his followers held a ""freedom party"" and gathered bananas, chips and beer to provide to convoy drivers who haven’t yet arrived.

       Some of the French protesters are threatening to continue their journey to Brussels, the capital of Belgium and the  European Union , and to meet up there with drivers from other countries on Monday. Belgian authorities also banned the threatened blockade, and a similar convoy planned for Friday in Vienna was canceled after authorities banned it. In France, dozens of cars left from a parking lot in the eastern city of Strasbourg on Friday, as scores of sympathizers brought them food and water and extra fuel, and cheered them on. A similar-sized group left from Lille, where one protester brandished a Canadian flag alongside the French tricolor. A smaller group gathered in the Loire Valley city of Orleans, among other cities. Patrick Proisy, mayor of nearby Faches-Thumesnil, from the far-left Defiant France party, told The Associated Press: ""I have come here in moral solidarity to show them that there are also elected officials who support them."" Members of the convoy were wary of journalists or hesitant to speak on the record, out of fear of arrest. They embody a mix of causes.

Ron DeSantis  and his wife, Casey DeSantis, sat down with Fox News Digital in a joint interview during which they reiterated their commitment to keeping Florida free in addition to announcing a new focus on cancer research and children's  mental health  in the months following the first lady's  breast cancer  diagnosis. Casey DeSantis told Fox News Digital on Monday that she feels ""really good"" and is starting to get her energy back again, after announcing she completed her final round of chemotherapy for breast cancer in January. She said she was motivated by her family, including children Madison, 5, Mason, 3, and Maime, 22 months, to continue fighting.  DESANTIS ANNOUNCES WIFE CASEY COMPLETED CHEMO TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER As part of his wife's commitment to continue fighting, Gov. DeSantis proposed to increase the state's budget by 60% for  cancer  research, bringing the total to $100 million. The first lady told Fox News Digital that early detections and screenings for cancer were imperative, especially in the aftermath of the  pandemic  that saw a large decline in individuals seeking preventative medical treatment.  The other pocket of funding would be dedicated to technology and innovation so ""we can finally find a cure for this thing,"" she said. The first lady in recent months has visited numerous children's hospitals and cancer centers throughout the state to discuss importance of early screenings and offer a sense of hope for children and adults going through chemotherapy.

The initiative includes a "" resiliency toolkit ,"" as well as the Hope Ambassador Clubs program, designed to create ""kind and compassionate school environments"" through peer-to-peer volunteering.  ""With mental health, what I noticed in traveling the state and speaking with a lot of kids is that if they come forward and say that they have a mental health issue, that they feel like a victim and that there's a stigma associated with it,"" Casey DeSantis told Fox News Digital.  DESANTIS SLAMS BIG TECH AND MEDIA FOR 'WHITEWASHING' THE 'GENOCIDE OLYMPICS,' SAYS BIDEN IS WEAK ON CHINA She detailed working with the state Department of Education to pass a standard and curriculum that goes toward mental health in addition to engaging with well-known athletes, including  Peyton Manning  and  Tom Brady , and sports teams to discuss how no one is immune from hardship.

DeSantis referred to the  1619 Project , authored by Nikole Hannah-Jones, who recently incorrectly claimed that the Civil War started the year it ended, among other controversial statements. ""So, for example, this 1619 Project that the New York Times parrots, they say that the American Revolution was fought both to defend slavery,"" he said. ""But if you look, there's literally nothing in the historical record."" Weaponizing history The governor continued, ""And so it's a historical, they're trying to weaponize history by distorting it in order to advance a political agenda. And so I think we've tackled that right. We are, though, increasing the ability of parents to be involved in the curriculum. Parents have a right to know what's being taught in schools. There's going to be more rights for parents after this legislative session so that they can make sure that our standards are enforced,"" he said. Casey DeSantis, a former TV host, also weighed in on the state of the national conversation, saying, ""I think we are divided, and I think it's very unfortunate. I think that if there were more  outlets  that would probably tell more accurate information that I don't think that we would be so divided. I think that there's a lot of entities that make a profit off of divisiveness."" Gov.

   EXCLUSIVE : GOP senators are calling on the Biden administration to publicize data on the effectiveness of natural immunity in preventing additional cases of COVID-19, arguing the White House is too concerned with mandates to recognize that millions of Americans have already built up natural antibodies from a prior infection.  GOP Sens. Mike Braun of Indiana and James Lankford of Oklahoma introduced the ""Natural Immunity Transparency Act"" in the Senate and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas is sponsoring the companion bill in the House to require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide data to Congress on the efficacy of natural immunity from COVID-19.      
      Sen. James Lankford on Oct. 19, 2021. 
       (Mandel Ngan/Pool via REUTERS) Their legislation would require HHS to report data on the number of unvaccinated people who recovered from COVID-19 and then were infected with an additional case of coronavirus. The bill also requires HHS to provide data on the number of people who were fully vaccinated who developed ""breakthrough cases"" of COVID-19. SUPREME COURT BLOCKS BIDEN OSHA VACCINE MANDATE, ALLOWS RULE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ""The Biden Administration is so obsessed with their vaccine mandates that they refuse to even evaluate or release information on those who have acquired natural immunity to COVID-19,"" Lankford said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Natural immunity is a component of reducing the spread of COVID-19, along with vaccines. We simply want the Biden Administration to provide the American people with the most accurate natural immunity data, so Americans can make their own decisions and better understand the reality of our current COVID circumstances."" The lawmakers point to a limited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) study  in January of New York and California COVID-19 cases that documented the benefits of natural immunity. VACCINE MANDATE DEADLINE TO START FOR FIRST WAVE OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS Before Delta became the predominant variant in June, vaccinated people had fewer COVID-19 infections than those who had prior immunity,  the study found . But by early October, the trend had reversed and people who survived a prior COVID-19 infection had lower infection rates than those with just the vaccination.      
      Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., on June 23, 2021.
       (Sarah Silbiger-Pool/Getty Images) The highest hospitalization rates between May and November 2021 were among people who were unvaccinated and didn't have a previous COVID-19 infection, the study said.  ""Just last month, the CDC released data that demonstrated natural immunity was 3-4 times as effective in preventing COVID-19 compared with vaccination,"" Braun said in a statement. ""The Biden Administration needs to release the full data on natural immunity from HHS instead of imposing heavy-handed mandates and confusing guidance that have gotten in the way of our recovery. Americans deserve full transparency and answers."" RAND PAUL VISITS THE BIG BOARD BAR IN DC: 'ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO RESIST THE MAN IS SOMEBODY I WANT TO MEET' The request for information comes as the Biden Administration still has a vaccine mandate for members of the military and certain health care workers, while the Supreme Court blocked Biden's sweeping vaccination-or-test mandate for private businesses with at least 100 employees.  Meanwhile, certain local governments, including Washington, D.C., are requiring proof of vaccination to enter private businesses –  drawing scorn  from GOP members of Congress who rallied behind one DC bar, the Big Board, that was resisting the mandate.  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on whether it has data on natural immunity.

       ""They are either unwilling to provide, or negligently not tracking, critical information to the American people on natural immunity acquired from a previous COVID infection while pushing unconstitutional and wrong-headed vaccine mandates with the power of government,"" Roy said of the Biden administration.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the United States, 76.8 million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than 903,000 people have died, according to the CDC.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   One  Connecticut  high school student is channeling his frustration and upset over the continued school mask mandates in his state into awareness, outreach and activism.  He wants others to know just how difficult the  enforced mask wearing  has been for students day in and day out, all through  the pandemic  — and why he thinks it should stop.  Lucas Johnson, 17, and other high school students in Connecticut want their classrooms and school experiences to return to normal  now   across the Constitution State. They know their state is in the process of dropping the mask mandate — according to Gov. Ned Lamont, the mandate will end Feb. 28 — but they don't want to wait a minute longer.  They also don't know what's over the horizon.  ""This is not just a fight for liberty,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital this week in a phone interview. ""It’s a fight for our generation."" CONNECTICUT FAMILY SHARES ‘HEARTBREAKING’ IMPACT OF MASK MANDATES The students are concerned that local municipalities and communities will wind up extending the mask mandates — leaving students stuck behind masks well beyond February.  Both Johnson, a high school senior in Danielson, Connecticut, and his mom, Patricia Johnson, talked to Fox News Digital recently.     
      High school student Lucas Johnson, right, during a recent family vacation. He shared his concerns about the enforced masking of students in school with Fox News Digital this week — and says the fight over mask mandates is about ""a fight for our generation.""
       (Patricia Johnson) ""All our scientific data shows that kids are the least susceptible to COVID but the most vulnerable to everything we’ve been doing,"" Lucas Johnson said, referring to the rising anxiety, depression, and other  mental health  issues that have come up over the past two years. ""I will continue to fight as hard as I can until kids are put back into a normal environment in school,"" he added. Johnson founded the advocacy group, Connecticut Students for Liberty. On Wednesday, Feb. 8, the group traveled to Hartford, the state capital, and stood on the steps of the Connecticut Statehouse, speaking out about how mask mandates have affected their lives.  NJ 3-YEAR-OLD KICKED OUT OF SPEECH THERAPY BECAUSE OF MASK ISSUES Among Johnson's comments that day, which caught the attention of some local outlets: ""The COVID mitigation tactics in school, particularly the mask mandate, have been detrimental and harmful to the mental health of students,"" as Connecticut Insider noted of Johnson.      
      Lucas Johnson, second from left, along with other family members during a recent vacation. His advocacy group for students helps other kids ""get involved and stand up for themselves,"" he told Fox News Digital.
       (Patricia Johnson) Lucas Johnson described to Fox News Digital his small advocacy group as 30-40 kids who are ""willing to do intense work"" for their freedoms.  ""It’s an outlet for kids,"" he also says of the group, ""to get involved and stand up for themselves."" Their goal is holding Connecticut state government accountable.  NJ MOM, FORCED TO GET VACCINE BEFORE FAMILY WEDDING, WINDS UP IN ER On a regular basis, the students peacefully protest, hold press conferences, conduct email and letter-writing campaigns, track legislation, and communicate through their dedicated Facebook page. Even though restrictions across Connecticut might be relaxing soon, these concerned students are not. They want their state to ""drop the mandates immediately.""     
      Lucas Johnson (far left) along with members of his family — he's the oldest of seven, and the family has another child on the way. His mom described him as ""the leader of our pack."" 
       (Patricia Johnson) Johnson is not just focused on the present. He's looking ahead to potential hazards around the state’s plan.  ""The governor requires the legislature to write the mandate into law for the time period between Feb. 15th [when Gov. Lamont’s executive order expires] and Feb. 28th,"" when authority is to be shifted to school administrators, Lucas Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""Since they have no bill in front of them, we don’t know who will take up the authority regarding mask mandates after the executive order expires."" He fears this gap may open the door for the legislature to shift power to the Connecticut Department of Public Health and the Connecticut Department of Education. ""We don’t want another mandate under a different name,"" he said. ‘Hiding their emotions’  Johnson said he and his peers feel ""disconnected from their teachers"" every day at school due to the masks they must wear. ""Kids are traumatized,"" he said. Masks, he said, make it easier for kids to ""hide their emotions.""      
      Lucas Johnson, a senior in high school in Connecticut, told Fox News Digital he's troubled by the mask mandates and wants them to end now — and he hopes they don't re-emerge under a different name.
       (Patricia Johnson) The enforced mask wearing, in his view, has also created an unhealthy fear of COVID  inside  the school — not something that's often reported.  ""You step out of school and there's no masks anywhere,"" Lucas Johnson said.  So ""school is a fearful environment now."" All of this and more is why Johnson’s group organized a recent school walkout of 150 students who oppose the mask mandates. ""We've seen Lucas work tirelessly to advocate for his peers and stand up for those who feel abandoned by the adults in their lives — namely the professionals in their schools.""   — Patricia Johnson, mom of Lucas Johnson, to Fox News Digital Johnson also said he has issues with the COVID mitigation tactics in school. He's had to quarantine four separate times due to contact tracing — and the stories he hears from other students and peers drive him to stay active and involved.  His mom, Patricia Johnson, by the way, stands firmly behind her son as he speaks up and out for his fellow students. ""We are very proud of our son Lucas,"" she told Fox News Digital in an email.

""But in these past two years we've seen Lucas work tirelessly to advocate for his peers and stand up for those who feel abandoned by the adults in their lives — namely the professionals in their schools."" ""Not only has he helped these students to find their voice,"" his mom continued, ""he's worked for the day that they won't be bullied anymore and silenced for trying to air their painful experiences."" ‘Really concerned’ Kathy Koch, PhD, an education psychologist based in Fort Worth, Texas, who is focused on kids and the impacts of COVID, told Fox News Digital this week that she's ""really concerned"" about what's been going on with kids and enforced masking.  The mask-wearing, said Koch, made sense at the beginning of the pandemic — now, ""we must prioritize children's well-being and the purpose of their being in school,"" she said.

   A U.S.  Border  Patrol ( USBP ) agent who contracted  COVID-19  while responding to the ongoing  immigration  crisis at the  Texas  southern border will be transported closer to home this week after a company donated his medical flight in the wake of the government’s alleged refusal to pay for the trip. Gustavo Medina was deployed from  Ohio  to Texas on Nov. 14, 2021, and tested positive for the virus only five days later, his wife, Ann Medina, has said. His condition worsened until he was hospitalized in McAllen, Texas, where he was ultimately placed on a ventilator and then, in a medically induced coma.  ""Gustavo is a fighter, but being so far away from home is taking a toll on the whole family,"" Ann Medina wrote of her husband in a GoFundMe page seeking support.   Ann Medina said the federal government denied her family's request to have her husband transferred to a hospital closer to home in Cleveland, effectively placing the cost and responsibility in their own hands.  Ann Medina later spoke about her family’s struggle during a Feb. 1 segment on "" Fox & Friends ,"" when she described how she had been searching for a private transport company to bring her husband home. Little did she know, an executive for emergency evacuation services company FocusPoint International was watching at the time and has since arranged for Gustavo Medina to be transported free of charge, the company confirmed.  ""It seems to me that the US Border Patrol has never been busier along our southern border than it is today, it’s unfortunate that Gustavo contracted COVID-19 in the line of duty, and even more unfortunate that Gustavo’s insurance claim to have him transported back home was denied,"" Greg Pearson, CEO of FocusPoint International, wrote in an email statement to Fox News.  BORDER PATROL AGENT HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID-19 AT SOUTHERN BORDER TRANSPORTED TO NEW FACILITY CLOSER TO HOME He added: ""After hearing Ann’s story, I felt transporting Gustavo back home was the least we could do to show our support, not only for the Medina family, but more broadly for the US Border Patrol and their critical mission along the Southern border.""

   Skyrocketing  unemployment  due to the coronavirus pandemic has been forcing a  growing number  of Americans to turn to charitable services for assistance as food insecurity among families with  children  grows. Philanthropist and  New York Mission Society  board member Jean Shafiroff joined Fox News to discuss how she’s helping her community and raising awareness to help curb the growing numbers of food-insecure Americans. New York City Mission Society has been serving the city’s most underserved children since 1812. Recently, it has been making food and utility baskets for the children it serves and delivering them during the pandemic. “I can't tell you how desperately these food baskets are needed...In the New York tri-state area, we have a very serious situation because so many residents live at or below the poverty level,” Shafiroff told Fox News. “The food pantries across the area are very helpful...but the supply and the demand are not working the way they should right now. There is massive demand all over the country --39 million Americans out of work, and this translates into no food on the table.” Shafiroff noted that a major issue during the pandemic has been getting food to the actual pantries, especially amid the  shuttering  of multiple meat processing plants across the country. The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  has even temporarily loosened its food labeling policies during the  coronavirus  pandemic to curtail supply chain disruptions and give producers more flexibility amid food shortages. According to a  Brookings analysis , almost 35 percent of households with children said they did not have sufficient food, that's 14 percent higher than during the recession. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Shafiroff is encouraging those who can afford it to make donations to their local food pantry. “I know my husband and I recently donated 10,000 meals to  Heart of the Hamptons , which is a food pantry in the Hamptons, because we feel so strongly about providing food and being part of the solution,” said Shafiroff, who is also the author of "" Successful Philanthropy: How to Make a Life By What You Give ,"" which explores the meaning of giving back in today’s era. ""And of course, 10,000 meals really doesn't mean much when you look at a country with 39 million people out of work, but if we all work together, I believe we can solve this problem.” For more with Philanthropist and  New York Mission Society  Board Member Jean Shafiroff watch the full video above.  Emily DeCiccio is a reporter and video producer for Fox News Digital Originals.

   MIAMI ––  With many Floridians back in business, a sense of normalcy has returned for some restaurant owners, including George Yiannikakis. “Like the rest of the restaurants, we got hit pretty bad in the sense that there was not much we could do. For us, the priority is to fill the existing capacity,” said Yiannikakis, the owner of Amaranthine restaurant in Miami Shores. But with a spike in new  COVID-19  cases, restaurant owners fear that may not happen. Miami is pausing its “phase three” reopening, which includes allowing restaurants to operate at full capacity, due to health concerns. That phase also would allow businesses including movie theaters, nightclubs and bars to reopen.     
      With many people back in business, the state's reopening brought a sense of normalcy back to restaurant owners like George Yiannikakis in Miami.
       (Elina Shirazi) Yiannikakis said the slow reopening is straining revenue for small-business owners. “If there would be an official mandate for the restaurants to open to 100 percent, people would feel that things are very safe. It is like giving people the green light to go out,”  Yiannikakis said. Health officials insist that holding off on reopening is the right approach “Just in three weeks in the state, we've gone from 175 cases per day to 2,200 cases per day,” said Dr. Charles Lockwood, the senior vice president at the University of South Florida Health. Lockwood blames the spike on two factors. “The first reason is, there's absolutely no doubt about it, tremendous increase in testing, and that accounts for 80 percent of the increase. So no problem there,"" he said. ""But we have some hints now that maybe about 20 percent are due to younger folks primarily that aren't abiding by social distancing. They aren't using face covers, are being reckless because young people think they're invulnerable ... and they're getting infected."" MIAMI TO REOPEN BEACHES, END CURFEW AFTER PROTESTS     
      Health officials say, for now, holding off isn't the worst idea. Charles Lockwood, the senior vice president at the University of South Florida Health says the spike is due to an increase in testing, and young people who aren't abiding by social distancing guidelines.
       (Elina Shirazi) He added, “As far as data, we've also gone from 35 deaths per day to 31 deaths per day. That's good. Hospitalizations have been dropping, but they've basically gone the last three weeks from about 127 to 150 per day. So we're going to watch that very carefully. Test negative rates basically essentially stayed the same. In the last week, it's gone from 94 to 94.4 percent.

   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said this week that third shots of  coronavirus   vaccines  significantly reduced the risk that people who are immunocompromised would be  hospitalized  due to COVID-19. In a Thursday study in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency said that – compared to hospitalized adults who had received two mRNA vaccine doses – the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA vaccines against hospitalization for patients with weak immune systems increased to 88%.  CASES OF 'STEALTH' OMICRON SUBVARIANT CONFIRMED IN NORTHEAST STATES: REPORTS For  immunocompromised people  who had only had two doses, or a ""primary series,"" the vaccines were 69% effective.  The data was gathered  looking at nearly 3,000 – 1,385 case-patients and 1,567 non-COVID-19 controls – at adults admitted to 21 hospitals across 18 states from Aug. 19 through Dec. 15 of last year. The agency noted the analysis start date was one week after the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized an additional dose for emergency use  for people aged 12 and older with immunocompromising conditions 28 days following their second dose. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated for both groups by comparing the odds of previous vaccination between COVID-19 case-patients and control patients who did not have the disease. The regression model was adjusted for admission date, region of hospital, age group, sex and self-reported race and ethnicity. Separate models were generated for immunocompetent adults and adults with immunocompromising conditions and analyses were conducted using Stata software. Those who had COVID-19-like illness received positive test results by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or antigen test and control patients received negative NAAT tests. Patients or their proxies were interviewed regarding demographic and clinical characteristics and medical record searches were conducted. Information regarding receipt of prior vaccine doses was obtained through self-report and review of source documentation.  Three vaccination groups were considered including unvaccinated patients, two-dose mRNA recipients and three-dose mRNA recipients. Three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were roughly 97% effective in preventing hospitalizations in those with stronger immune systems, compared with 82% of those with two doses. PSAKI: 'FULLY VACCINATED' DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE 'UP-TO-DATE' ON VACCINATIONS Notably, the study was conducted when the delta variant was predominant in the U.S., whereas omicron now makes up nearly 100% of new cases nationally. Limitations to these findings include that vaccine recipients in both dose groups were similar in terms of most demographic and clinical characteristics but may have varied with respect to exposure risk for infection, that vaccine effectiveness was not assessed against mild illness or infection, that vaccine effectiveness with a fourth mRNA vaccine dose in immunocompromised individuals was not assessed and that most three-dose mRNA vaccine recipients were vaccinated within several weeks of enrollment and durability of protection will require future analysis.  ""Early evidence suggests that a third mRNA vaccine dose elicits markedly stronger neutralizing antibody responses to the omicron variant compared with responses to two vaccine doses,  and increases [vaccine effectiveness] against severe disease following infection with the omicron variant,"" the CDC wrote. ""The effectiveness of three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines against a range of disease severity associated with the omicron variant needs to be carefully evaluated in different populations.""   Video In January, regulators said adults could receive boosters at least  five months  after their second dose. As omicron spread, the  White House has called on Americans to get their booster  and the CDC said that administration of a third COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose as part of a primary series among immunocompromised adults, or as a booster dose among immunocompetent adults, provides improved protection against COVID-19 hospitalization. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Among adults with and without immunocompromising conditions who were eligible to receive a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, third doses were found to increase protection beyond that of a two-dose vaccination series for the prevention of COVID-19 hospitalization.  According to the  American Medical Association , there are about seven million people with weakened immune systems in the country.

VA AG Jason Miyares: Masks creating mental health crisis among school children,Fox News Staff," January 30, 2022 11:33am EST","  close     Video   VA AG Jason Miyares: Masks creating mental health crisis among school children   Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares weighs in on the effects of masking school children. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   During an interview on  ""Fox & Friends Weekend""  Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said that school districts in his state are defying an executive order from Governor Glenn Youngkin that made masks optional for school children. Miyares said the executive order is an action to ‘follow through on campaign promises’ to prioritize a parent's right to choose what's best for their child. YOUNGKIN'S CRT TIP LINE HAS DEMS, TEACHERS PANICKING: REPORT JASON MIYARES:  If you're a parent and you want your child to wear a mask 6 or 7, 8 hours a day, that's great. That's your right. But recognize there are going to be other parents that come to a very different conclusion. And what's so tragic about all this is we're not talking about the kids. You know, if you're a parent of a child with asthma, as one parent shared with me, wearing a mask for now close to 2 years has been just a very difficult experience. I had another parent who shared with me, their daughter, they used to be an all A student is now mostly C student because they wear glasses and the school has gone from a joy to complete misery. And another parent of a school - age child said how excited their child was, their daughter was, that for the very first time, they could see what their best friend from school actually looks like. I mean, think about the mental health crisis as well that we're having on our kids. … So this is simply saying, Listen, we live in a pluralistic society, people are going to think differently. If you're a parent, you know what's best for you. And guess what? That's in the code of Virginia. That's the message I would give to these school boards is it's explicit in the code that in the law, parents have a fundamental right to the education upbringing of the children. So all this is saying right now is about parental empowerment. That's what Governor Youngkin ran on. That was a big issue that I ran on as well. We're just following through on our campaign promises. We are proud to stand with parents and we're really hoping the school boards will get the message… We're now going into year 3 of this and we need to recognize the impact it's having on our children.

Omicron variant increases concerns about long COVID and its causes,Associated Press," January 31, 2022 10:20am EST","  close     Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for January 31   Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

   More than a year after a bout with COVID-19, Rebekah Hogan still suffers from severe brain fog, pain and fatigue that leave her unable to do her nursing job or handle household activities. Long COVID has her questioning her worth as a wife and mother. ""Is this permanent? Is this the new norm?’’ said the 41-year-old  Latham, New York , woman, whose three children and husband also have signs of the condition. ""I want my life back.’’ More than a third of  COVID-19 survivors  by some estimates will develop such lingering problems. Now, with omicron sweeping across the globe, scientists are racing to pinpoint the cause of the bedeviling condition and find treatments before a potential explosion in long COVID cases. Could it be an autoimmune disorder? That could help explain why long COVID-19 disproportionately affects women, who are more likely than men to develop autoimmune diseases. Could microclots be the cause of symptoms ranging from memory lapses to discolored toes? That could make sense, since abnormal blood clotting can occur in COVID-19. As these theories and others are tested, there is fresh evidence that vaccination may reduce the chances of developing long COVID. It’s too soon to know whether people infected with the highly contagious omicron variant will develop the mysterious constellation of symptoms, usually diagnosed many weeks after the initial illness. But some experts think a wave of long COVID is likely and say doctors need to be prepared for it. With $1 billion  from Congress , the National Institutes of Health is funding a vast array of research on the condition. And clinics devoted to studying and treating it are popping up around the world, affiliated with places such as Stanford University in California and  University College London . 'STEALTH' OMICRON VARIANT BA.2 CIRCULATING IN ALMOST HALF OF US, BUT CDC EXERCISES CAUTION: REPORT WHY DOES IT HAPPEN? Momentum is building around a few key theories. One is that the infection or remnants of the virus persist past the initial illness, triggering inflammation that leads to long COVID. Another is that latent viruses in the body, such as the Epstein-Barr virus that causes mononucleosis, are reactivated. A recent study in the journal Cell pointed to Epstein-Barr in the blood as one of four possible risk factors, which also include pre-existing Type 2 diabetes and the levels of coronavirus RNA and certain antibodies in the blood. Those findings must be confirmed with more research. A third theory is that autoimmune responses develop after acute COVID-19. In a normal immune response, viral infections activate antibodies that fight invading virus proteins. But sometimes in the aftermath, antibodies remain revved up and mistakenly attack normal cells. That phenomenon is thought to play a role in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. Justyna Fert-Bober and Dr. Susan Cheng were among researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in  Los Angeles  who found that some people who have had COVID-19, including cases without symptoms, have a variety of these elevated ""autoantibodies"" up to six months after recovering. Some are the same ones found in people with autoimmune diseases. Another possibility is that tiny clots play a role in long COVID. Many COVID-19 patients develop elevated levels of inflammatory molecules that promote abnormal clotting. That can lead to blood clots throughout the body that can cause strokes, heart attacks and dangerous blockages in the legs and arms. In her lab at Stellenbosch University in  South Africa , scientist Resia Pretorius has found microclots in blood samples from patients with COVID-19 and in those who later developed long COVID. She also found elevated levels of proteins in blood plasma that prevented the normal breakdown of these clots. She believes that these clotting abnormalities persist in many patients after an initial coronavirus infection and that they reduce oxygen distribution to cells and tissue throughout the body, leading to most if not all symptoms that have been linked to long COVID.   IT CAN HIT NEARLY ANYONE While there’s no firm list of symptoms that define the condition, the most common include fatigue, problems with memory and thinking, loss of taste and smell, shortness of breath, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Some of these symptoms may first appear during an initial infection but linger or recur a month or more later. Or new ones may develop, lasting for weeks, months or over a year. Because so many of the symptoms occur with other illnesses, some scientists question whether the coronavirus is always the trigger. Researchers hope their work will provide definitive answers. Long COVID affects adults of all ages as well as children. Research shows it is more prevalent among those who were hospitalized, but also strikes a significant portion who weren’t. Retired flight attendant Jacki Graham’s bout with COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic wasn’t bad enough to put her in the hospital. But months later, she experienced breathlessness and a racing heart. She couldn’t taste or smell. Her blood pressure shot up. In the fall of 2020, she became so fatigued that her morning yoga would send her back to bed. ""I’m an early riser, so I’d get up and push myself, but then I was done for the day,"" said Graham, 64, of Studio City, California. ""Six months ago, I would have told you COVID has ruined my life."" Hogan, the New York nurse, also wasn’t hospitalized with COVID-19 but has been debilitated since her diagnosis. Her husband, a disabled veteran, and children ages 9, 13 and 15 fell ill soon after and were sick with fever, stomach pains and weakness for about a month. Then all seemed to get a little better until new symptoms appeared. Hogan's doctors think autoimmune abnormalities and a pre-existing connective tissue disorder that causes joint pain may have made her prone to developing the condition.

But more help may be on the horizon. Immunobiologist Akiko Iwasaki is studying the tantalizing possibility that  COVID-19 vaccination  might reduce long COVID symptoms. Her team at Yale University is collaborating with a patient group called Survivor Corps on a study that involves vaccinating previously unvaccinated long COVID patients as a possible treatment. Iwasaki, who is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which supports The Associated Press’  Health  and Science Department, said she is doing this study because patient groups have reported improvement in some people's long COVID symptoms after they got their shots. Study participant Nancy Rose, 67, of Port Jefferson, New York, said many of her symptoms waned after she got vaccinated, though she still has bouts of fatigue and memory loss. Two recently released studies, one from the U.S. and one from Israel, offer preliminary evidence that being vaccinated before getting COVID-19 could help prevent the lingering illness or at least reduce its severity. Both were done before omicron emerged. Neither has been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but outside experts say the results are encouraging. In the Israeli study, about two-thirds of participants received one or two Pfizer shots; the others were unvaccinated. Those who had received two shots were at least half as likely to report fatigue, headache, muscle weakness or pain and other common long COVID symptoms as the unvaccinated group.   UNCERTAIN FUTURE With few clear answers yet, the future is murky for patients. Many, like Graham, see improvement over time. She sought help through a long COVID program at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled in a study there in April 2021, and was vaccinated and boosted. Today, she said, her blood pressure is normal, and her sense of smell and energy level are getting closer to pre-COVID levels. Still, she wound up retiring early because of her ordeal. Hogan still struggles with symptoms that include agonizing nerve pain and ""spaghetti legs,’’ or limbs that suddenly become limp and unable to bear weight, a condition that also affects her 13-year-old son. Some scientists worry that long COVID in certain patients might become a form of chronic fatigue syndrome, a poorly understood, long-lasting condition that has no cure or approved treatment. One thing’s for sure, some experts say: Long COVID will have a huge effect on individuals, health care systems and economies around the world, costing many billions of dollars. Even with insurance, patients can be out thousands of dollars at a time when they’re too sick to work. Graham, for example, said she paid about $6,000 out of pocket for things like scans, labs, doctor visits and chiropractic care. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS Pretorius, the scientist in South Africa, said there is real worry things could get worse. ""So many people are losing their livelihoods, their homes. They can’t work anymore,"" she said. ""Long COVID will probably have a more severe impact on our economy than acute COVID.""  "

   New Hampshire  Gov. Chris Sununu joined CNN’s ""State of the Union"" Sunday to reiterate America’s need for bipartisanship. The Republican was pressed by host Dana Bash on how the spreading of  COVID  misinformation could be costing constituent lives, but Sununu argued that the only byproduct is ""massive confusion."" ""We try to clarify in New Hampshire,"" he said. ""Be super transparent. That earns public trust and I think that’s why New Hampshire has had a fairly high vaccination rate even without mandates."" As streaming platform Spotify takes a hit for airing Joe Rogan’s podcast under the accusation of spreading misinformation, Sununu denounced the possibility of censorship and, instead, backed the  First Amendment. ""It’s free speech,"" he asserted. ""People have a right to their voice and a right to their opinion."" Sununu has upheld his reputation of critiquing both sides of the political aisle – this ultimately leading him to decline his bid for Senate back in November: ""My responsibility is not to the gridlock and politics of Washington, it’s to the citizens of New Hampshire.

Instead, under the Biden administration, he asserted, political isolation has set back the entire nation. ""If the Democrat Party spent as much time trying to reach across the aisle with a couple Republicans as they did beating up Sens. Sinema and Manchin, we would have got something done,"" he said. ""But they spent all their time tearing apart their own party… And I think I’m expressing the same frustrations that, frankly, most Americans have.""

Now is time to learn to live with COVID – and expand arsenal of tools against it,Dr. Marc Siegel," January 31, 2022 1:03pm EST","  close     Video   Vaccine mandate for truckers makes no public health sense 'at all': Dr. Siegel   Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on growing backlash against cross-border vaccine mandate for truckers. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   A group of 2,700 truckers known as the ""freedom convoy"" has made its way to Ottawa to protest mandatory vaccination as a literal roadblock against  truckers re-entering Canada  from the U.S. This, despite the fact that 90% of truckers have at least two vaccine shots, and there is a high rate of COVID/omicron spread despite  vaccination . The requirement also ignores the fact that other countries, including Israel and the European Union, have made allowances for recovery from COVID (natural immunity) as a form of protection that is just as valid as vaccines.    Video This acknowledgement is in keeping with the growing reality that no immunity is enough by itself and all  immunity against COVID  is helpful. COVID – FACTS, FICTION AND FEAR A more effective public health strategy might be to ask for rapid testing at border crossings, rather than to insist on a rigid outdated proof of vaccination, especially considering that omicron is everywhere and targeting truckers is a poor approach both medically and politically. Consider that truckers are true front-line workers. They are bringing food and other staples into people’s lives. They can’t work remotely, and they have been braving the pandemic since the beginning.    Video Reuters reports that 90% of Canada’s cross-border truckers and 77% of the Canadian population have had at least two shots, so compliance is certainly not the issue. The Canadian Trucking Alliance, which represents 4,500 carriers, opposes the protest, which shows they are out of touch.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has said the convoy does not ""represent the views of Canadians,"" is currently in quarantine because his son has COVID, yet is reportedly being moved to a more secure location. He is out of touch as well, and we certainly hope he doesn’t spread COVID in the process of being moved by his security detail from one location to the next.

       (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP) This is occurring at a time when COVID case and death rates are plummeting in Canada, as well as the Northeastern U.S., and other countries, including the U.K., are pulling back on all restrictions. This is exactly what Canada should be doing and what we should be considering in the U.S. as well.  The mental health toll of rigid superimposed mandates and passports has been enormous and it isn’t clear that they have been working. Masks likely have some value if high quality and properly worn in high-traffic areas where there is a lot of COVID spread, but government-imposed mask mandates at schools and businesses can do more harm than good.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Now is a time to learn to live with COVID. Now is a time to expand our arsenal of tools against it.    Video Government efforts should be focused on expanding the availability of the extremely scarce but effective anti-viral Paxlovid, the monoclonal antibody that works against omicron, Sotrovimab, and countering the continued scarcity of rapid home tests (despite the Biden administration’s highly advertised giveaway). A free N-95 mask or two mailed to your local pharmacy or health center is not the answer; it is more a symbol of further constriction rather than a public health windfall. The public needs to pivot from restrictions and scolding rhetoric to providing more tools.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A step in the right direction occurred this week when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally revealed data which showed that by fall and the upsurge of delta cases, ""people who had survived a previous infection had lower case rates than persons who were vaccinated alone.""  The governments of both Canada and the U.S. need to pay attention to this data and finally acknowledge natural immunity as a component at least short-term after infection.

   Baltimore’s  top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, is expected to make her first court appearance this week on federal  charges  alleging she lied about experiencing  COVID-19-related  financial hardships to draw from a city fund and made false statements on mortgage applications to purchase vacation homes in  Florida .  Mosby, sworn in as the 25th State’s Attorney for Baltimore at the start of 2015, has refused to resign over the federal indictment handed down earlier this month. The 41-year-old is expected to appear for her arraignment this week in U.S. District Court in Baltimore,  Fox 45 of Baltimore  reported.  It remains unclear what plea she plans to enter. A grand jury on Jan. 13 returned an indictment for Mosby on federal charges of perjury and making false mortgage applications relating to the purchases of two vacation homes in Florida, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron  announced.   VP HARRIS WAS ‘INSPIRATION' FOR INDICTED BALTIMORE OFFICIAL: ‘NO MARILYN MOSBY WITHOUT KAMALA HARRIS’  Mosby’s gross salary in 2020 was $247,956, and it was never reduced, according to the  indictment .  Yet, she still requested coronavirus-related withdrawals in the amounts of $40,000 and $50,000 from the City of Baltimore’s deferred compensation plans.

Nick Mosby is not charged in the case.  Marilyn Mosby also allegedly falsely executed a ""second home rider"" on the Kissimmee vacation home so that she could obtain a lower interest rate on the mortgage for the property.

Mosby denied any wrongdoing and said the federal investigation served as retribution for her handling of Gray's case and other criminal justice reform policies ushered in during her tenure,  NPR  reported.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If convicted, Mosby faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for each of two counts of perjury and a maximum of 30 years in federal prison for each of two counts of making false mortgage applications, federal prosecutors said.  Kurt Nachtman, a former prosecutor in the state’s attorney’s office, told Fox 45 that a plea deal is always possible, though Mosby does not seem interested in one. Nachtman says electing to go to federal trial and losing could result in a heftier sentence.  Fox News’ Brie Stimson and Adam Sabes contributed to this report.   "

About 78% of the population as a whole is fully vaccinated, according to  government statistics , and almost 84% of Canadians have received at least one dose. But the holdouts want an end to mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions. ""People in our country are fed up,"" LaRocque said. ""It’s inconsistent with the decision-making.

   WASHINGTON (AP) — When  President Joe Biden  met with U.S. governors at the White House on Monday, he was the only one given a glass of water — lest anyone else remove their mask to take a drink. The president was seated more than 10 feet from everyone, including Vice President Kamala Harris and members of his Cabinet. A White House staffer who was wearing a surgical mask when Biden entered the room was quickly handed an N95 version.

       (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) It’s no surprise that unusual steps are taken to protect any president. But the strict precautions could also threaten to undercut the Biden administration’s own efforts to tell Americans — especially those who are  vaccinated and boosted  — that they can get on with something closer to their normal lives  in the face of the omicron wave. TUCKER CARLSON: BIDEN'S SPEECHES REVEAL WHAT HE THINKS OF AMERICANS These are just some of the extraordinary efforts on the part of the White House to keep the president from getting  COVID-19 , even though he’s gotten both of his regular vaccinations and his booster. And it’s emblematic of the messaging challenges surrounding the administration’s approach to COVID-19 as the virus becomes endemic, familiar and somewhat controlled but still menacing, with hard-to-follow guidelines  often unevenly implemented . For months, Biden aides have fretted that the people who are most protected against COVID-19 remain the most cautious, a dynamic they view as a drag on the nation’s economic and psychological recovery. When the highly transmissible omicron variant hit, Biden said it was a ""cause for concern, not cause for panic.""     
      President Joe Biden
       (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) In recent weeks, his aides and science advisers have highlighted study after study showing the strong protection offered by the COVID vaccines against the variant and reassuring vaccinated people they can go about their daily lives. At a Jan. 19 press conference, Biden declared: ""We have the tools — vaccines, boosters, masks, tests, pills — to save lives and keep businesses and schools open"" and rejected the notion that still-widespread restrictions reflect a ""’new normal."" ""It will get better,"" he promised. Since even before Biden was elected, his aides have gone all-out to protect the now-79-year-old president from potential infection. He spent much of the 2020 campaign season holding remote events from a studio in the basement of his home, venturing out for travel in a bubble of frequently tested aides subject to an array of restrictions. That caution continued well after he was fully vaccinated and living at the White House. The president has held up his administration’s fidelity to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as a virtue, after they were regularly flouted by former President Donald Trump, who became seriously ill after contracting the virus. As the nation’s virus response and vaccination campaign has become increasingly politicized, White House officials have expressed both political and policy concerns over a possible Biden infection. Though the vaccines are highly effective, a breakthrough case could erode public confidence in the shots and be used as a political cudgel against a president who was elected to bring an end to the pandemic. KAMALA HARRIS CRUSHED FOR NON-ANSWER ABOUT CHANGING UP COVID STRATEGY, DRAWS COMPARISONS TO FICTIONAL BUFFOONS Biden himself has at times taken a more relaxed approach to restrictions. When the CDC last May surprised the White House by easing its guidelines on indoor mask-wearing by fully vaccinated individuals, Biden sought to publicly model the policy for the rest of the nation. He was meeting with vaccinated Republican lawmakers when the change was announced and led the group in removing their masks. But that CDC guidance proved to be premature and was reversed over the summer, because vaccinated people could still transmit the virus, potentially endangering the tens of millions of Americans who are still unvaccinated.

       (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) When the delta strain surged last fall, the White House strengthened its testing protocols for everyone close to Biden — restrictions that had been lessened once aides were fully vaccinated and case counts began to fall nationally. In-person meetings were once again curtailed. Aides began increasing the distance between Biden and even vaccinated-and-tested individuals as a precaution, reminiscent of his earliest days in office. In early January, as the nation’s capital led the country in per capita COVID-19 cases, White House press secretary Jen Psaki highlighted the ""very strict precautions"" taken to keep Biden and Harris safe, including mandatory mask-wearing and daily testing for those coming in contact with them. She also said the White House had taken to limiting gatherings ""to under 30 people."" But there were nearly 40 participants named by the administration — as well as two dozen members of the press — at Biden’s Monday meeting with the governors. SCIENTISTS SPEAK OUT ON BEING SILENCED WHEN RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS LAB LEAK THEORY Psaki said the administration takes extra precautions any time the president removes his mask to speak to a group. She noted that the nation continues to set records in reported cases and hospital admissions. ""The president’s view is that right now we still need to keep our heads down and stay at it to fight what is still surging in parts of the country,"" she said. ""But we do have the tools to get to a point where it does not disrupt our daily lives."" Biden, aides say, has relished opportunities outside the White House when he can engage in the sort of political glad-handing that has been suppressed by the pandemic. And in public, he’s chafed at some of the precautions, saying that the first thing he aims to do differently in his second year in the White House is ""I’m going to get out of this place more often."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He’s hardly alone in his impatience. On Monday, seated across a large gap from Biden in the East Room, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the chair of the governors’ association, appealed for the government to more clearly define a pathway out of the pandemic. ""We need the CDC to help us to have the right standards to end this pandemic and move to more endemic status,"" he said. ""We want to go from today to more normal."" The night before, the president and first lady Jill Biden did attend the black-tie National Governors Association dinner at Mount Vernon. Biden spoke, but he didn’t stay for dinner.  "

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Speaking to Fox News,  scientists  from the U.S., Britain, Germany, Israel and Australia have recounted that it was difficult to publish research about the possibility that the  COVID-19 pandemic  began due to a lab leak, and that they found themselves shunned by other scientists, even when those scientists themselves found the lab-leak theory plausible. ""We got our heads shot from every direction, from people who we now know were actually thinking exactly the same thing, but have chosen to say the opposite,""  Nikolai Petrovsky , a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Australia, told Fox News Digital. CHAFFETZ: FAUCI, FEDS TRIED TO QUASH COVID LAB LEAK ORIGIN THEORY – PROTECTING CHINESE INTERESTS OVER AMERICAN LIVES The scientists speaking to Fox News claimed that others in the field were desperate to protect the scientific community – and funding – so they coalesced around the single idea that a lab leak would have hurt their work, and the community. The scientists who supported the theory had research papers rejected, and the media branded them conspiracy theorists.

       (REUTERS/Thomas Peter) Lord Matt Ridley, author of the book ""Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19,"" told Fox News that funding was also a motive for silence. ""Senior scientists were quietly saying to me, 'We think you're right that it does need to be taken seriously, but we don't say so because the funding agencies might give us a hard time.'"" The  lab leak theory  has now become mainstream, but for a long time most outspoken scientists rejected it, including those at the very top. German physicist  Roland Wiesendanger  called this move a betrayal of science. ""If famous and top virologists are not sticking to the truth anymore, then we have no basis in science anymore to make progress,"" Wiesendanger told Fox News Digital.  REPUBLICANS INVESTIGATING COVID-19 ORIGINS SLAM BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S 'UNSATISFACTORY RESPONSES' Wiesendanger warned that scientists often believe they have a license to do whatever research they like, regardless of the risk – in the name of science. ""There were always scientists saying that scientists should be able to do anything, whatever is in their imagination,"" the German physicist said. ""They should be able to do this no matter what the concerns are from other scientists or the general public."" There was also a fear that if COVID-19 was the result of this risky gain-of-function research, science itself would be harmed, the scientists explained. ""When they show that science could create something so malicious, this is a very big obstacle for the scientific community because it actually proves that science can do something that could be very violent and wrong,"" Israeli biotechnologist  Ronen Shemesh  told Fox News Digital. Shemesh and others said it is a major concern that little has changed – gain-of-function research continues, both in the U.S. and abroad. Some say the research has actually picked up and there are growing calls for international regulations to monitor it. At the moment, regulations vary from country to country.  Despite plenty of evidence that a lab leak was highly likely, even established medical journals refused to publish the scientists' work.

       Petrovsky – who with the help of Oracle-- used their super computers to map the virus, thereby showing that it likely came from a lab – said he received blanket rejections from editors at medical journals who called his work ""too hot to handle."" He was also told it would harm relations with China – a country that has such a huge influence over the medical community and research papers. ""There was a concern about offending China,"" Petrovsky said. ""And obviously, there are a lot of links with China within science, and people didn't want to upset that relationship"" Although the evidence grew, the mainstream media rejected them, too. Lord Ridley told Fox News Digital, ""You weren't allowed to discuss this possibility on Facebook. Wikipedia pretty well censored it. And the New York Times and other outlets basically said that's a conspiracy theory that's been already debunked."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the silence continued through 2020, many said it all was political. ""They feared this might help former President Donald Trump,"" Shemesh said. The scientists expressed hope, however. Now that the idea of a lab leak has become more mainstream, that may spark investigations into the origins of the virus and, just as importantly, the way it was handled. There have already been numerous bipartisan calls for inquires.  "

   Do you ever notice how almost all of the leaders of almost all the countries in the  Western  world, particularly in the English-speaking Western world, seem kind of the same? They're what we call neoliberal. They're all weak and fearful, if you think about it. And yet if you listen to them talk, you'd think they were omnipotent: 'We're going to reverse global climate change. We're going to vaccinate the world. We're going to end all human prejudice and replace it with equity. We're going to spread democracy to the untutored nations with guns, and they're going to love us for it. We can do all these things because we're all-powerful. We're like gods. You shall have no gods before us.'  Now, mostly they're puny people. But when they speak, they sound like Caesar standing in purple robes in the forum, commanding the known world.  Joe Biden  very often sounds like this, so does that squeaky little woman with weird teeth who runs New Zealand. They all sound like this. They're unbelievably grandiose. It's by design. They'd rather talk about redeeming humanity than bother to fix your kid's  school  or replace the stop sign at the end of your block.  CRITICS MOCK ‘PUPPET’ TRUDEAU FOR FLEEING CAPITAL DURING TRUCKERS PROTEST: ‘TYRANT ON THE RUN’  So you've got to wonder, why do they talk this way? And the answer, of course, is because they're terrified. They claim to be powerful because they know they're not. It's a bluff. It's a calculated pose. In fact, they know exactly how weak they are. They understand how little popular support they actually have, and they can feel their grasp slipping. And if you wonder if that's true, notice how they overreact to the slightest challenge to their power. Remember a year ago when the QAnon Shaman skipped through  Congress  on his mescaline trip, giggling and spreading good vibes? It was kind of amusing. But  Democrats  in Washington were panicked by it, so panicked they called in the  U.S. Army  and sent that poor guy to prison. It's weird how touchy they get when you suggest they stole the presidential election, I wonder why?

       But this is not the behavior of secure leaders. This is how despots act when they fear they're about to be overthrown. And there's no more fearful despot in the world than  Justin Trudeau  of Canada. Over the span of just a few years, Trudeau has turned a nation long famous for Molson and sled dogs in niceness into a relentlessly punitive surveillance state. People have long whispered, in dead seriousness, that Justin Trudeau is the biological son of Fidel Castro. You could laugh it off, but now it's becoming pretty easy to believe. Trudeau has used systematically  COVID  to short circuit democracy in Canada and to end organized  Christianity  there.  Canadians  can no longer travel freely within their own country. They can no longer return to their own country at certain parts. Pastors have been imprisoned for holding church services. The unvaccinated can be sent to jail for buying certain products in stores. In the town of Gatineau, family members were arrested for celebrating New Year's Eve in their own home. Every large institution in Canada pretends like all of this is perfectly normal, it's always been this way. Canadian media, which are largely controlled by the government, support these policies and Trudeau uncritically. In Nova Scotia, protests against Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates are now banned by law.  CANADIAN NEWS HOST SLAMMED FOR SUGGESTING RUSSIA BEHIND MASSIVE 'FREEDOM' TRUCKER PROTEST Rarely has a nation changed this quickly or more unequivocally for the worse. And last week, thousands of Canadian truckers reached their limit. A convoy of truckers converged on the capital city of Ottawa to demand, peacefully, cheerfully but persistently an end to Justin Trudeau's tyranny. Justin Trudeau's response to this display of democracy? He fled the city. Trudeau evacuated his official residence and hid in an undisclosed location. He is still cowering there tonight. Will he come back? Has he abdicated? Will Canada be ruled by a junta of truckers? Well, not at this point. He emerged by video conference from his lair to declare that Canadian citizens who disagree with him are in fact attacking democracy.  TRUDEAU:  There is a right to protest, there is a right to make your voices heard, loudly and clearly. There is not a right to shut down our democracy or our democratic processes, there is not a right to abuse, intimidate and harass your fellow citizens.   So expressing your views is an attack on democracy? And by the way, how dare you express your views as if you were free people. That's tyranny. Democracy is when you obey like serfs. Trudeau just effectively said that. And then because he has no self-awareness whatsoever, Trudeau announced that he's contracted COVID, which is perfect. In other words, take this shot or else, as you can see from the fact I am now sick, it works perfectly.  NOVA SCOTIA OUTLAWS SUPPORT ON HIGHWAY FOR 'FREEDOM' TRUCKERS DAYS AFTER MASSIVE PROTEST If Canada were in a country, it would be a remarkable dark comedy. So you may be wondering about these hordes of Visigoths who's descended on Ottawa, the ones who drove Justin Trudeau out of the city. What do they look like?  Freedom, love, patriotic displays waving Canadian flags. Terrifying. But if you look closely at those pictures, you can see the real problem. These were working-class people. They're the guys who deliver your Amazon boxes. And Justin Trudeau is repulsed by them. These people have stepped way outside their lanes. Just leave the package on the porch and get the hell out of here. But they haven't gotten the hell out of there. They're still in Ottawa, and Justin Trudeau won't meet with them because he never meets with people like this, not simply because they are blue-collar and dirty, though obviously they are, but because they disagree with him. As a reminder from Justin Trudeau, that's what democracy is. Democracy is lecturing people who nod a lot in response. Watch him explain.  TRUDEAU: I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agreed with the goals, when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues, Black Lives Matter is an excellent example of that.

       So I'll meet with the people at a rally as long as I agree with their goals, as long as they agree with me, it's totally fine, like Black Lives Matter. You get the sense even someone as dim as Justin Trudeau realizes this is not a winning argument. He needed his friends in state media to help. So they trotted out some attack lines against the truckers lines they borrowed directly from CNN and NBC News here in the States. So here's Canada's state broadcaster inventing a claim, out of nothing, that Vladimir Putin himself may be responsible for this trucker convoy.  TRUDEAU SLAMS ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ FOR ‘HATEFUL RHETORIC,’ PREFERS TO SUPPORT BLM PROTESTERS  CBC NEWS: You know, given Canada's support of Ukraine in this current crisis with Russia, I don't know if it's farfetched to ask, but there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this, as this protest grows, but perhaps even instigating it from the outset.  Russia . You've got to love Canada. But let's be honest, they always steal our ideas and produce a slightly shoddy copy of them. We have Wal-Mart, they have Canadian Tire, not to be mean. Russia, of course, Putin did it. There's no evidence of that. No sources. They've just been reading American Twitter. And the state media anchor is deeply concerned. Who buys this? No one's going to buy this, it's so prima fascia absurd, so they just kept going. Here's Justin Trudeau from his bunker offering yet another reason to distrust the hunta  running the newly formed nation of Truckistan, formerly known as Canada.  TRUDEAU : We won't give in to those who fly racist flags. We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans. CANADIAN 'FREEDOM' TRUCKERS MASSIVE VACCINE MANDATE PROTEST CONVOY MAY SMASH WORLD RECORD Dishonor the memory, too many Canadian flags. There are like three bad people in the crowd, so ignore them all, ladies and gentlemen. Thankfully, by contrast, no one in any BLM rally ever torched a courthouse or shot anybody or burned down a building. But these truckers, apparently, there was a racist flag. So pay no attention. Now in the United States, we probably wouldn't fall for this at this late date. We're a little jaded at this point because we've seen it so many times. Oh, they had a Confederate flag, never mind, we can ignore their concerns. The election was totally fine. So again, we've seen it before. But in Canada, they probably haven't seen it, they're a few years behind us. And so, you know, they're kind of impressed by it. Claims like this happened here a few months ago, as you may remember, when Democratic operatives carried around tiki torches to smear Glenn Youngkin as a White supremacist. Again, Trudeau had reason to think Canadians hadn't seen that, and he might be able to get away with it. Trudeau has been honing this line of argument for months now. Last September, you may remember he accused people who opposed mandatory vaccination, getting a shot because the government requires it, of being racist.  TRUDEAU:  But also, there are people who are fiercely opposed to vaccination. Who don’t believe in science. Who are often misogynist, often racist too.   Poor Canadians. They're good people. They don't have a lot of news sources. They've been exposed nonstop for two years to this kind of propaganda. If you don't believe in mandatory injection with an experimental medicine, you're a racist. Apparently, some believe it, at least one counter-protester this weekend believed it.  WASHINGTON POST, MSNBC TRASH CANADIAN ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ TRUCKERS: ‘IT’S A CULT'  REBEL NEWS:  What did it say, sorry?  PROTESTER: So it says, 'F*** your White nationalist agenda.’ SECOND PROTESTER :  I am not White; this has nothing to do with White. This is nothing to do with truckers. This is about freedom for all Canadians. You can't be Brown, Black, White, whatever color you want to be. This is about freedom. Trudeau no right to put us in this condition or indeed want the country to going to school. It's a terrible thing to do.   Oh, thank God for Rebel News. You think Fox is an anomaly in the United States, how would you like to be Rebel News? Literally the only people in all of Canada who are playing it straight. So there they are, trying to tell you that some guy from the subcontinent is a w=White nationalist. They're trying, they're trying hard. And now they have evidence, it's brought to you by CNN, naturally, working in tandem with the CBC. Apparently, brace yourselves, there was a  Trump  sign in the crowd of truckers.  CNN:  Given the potential risk, Jim, Justin Trudeau and his family, he has three kids, live about a mile from Parliament Hill. They have now been moved somewhere. We don't know where, it's an undisclosed location out of an abundance of caution. I will also say that former President Trump certainly is supporting this group. I've been out there. I have seen Trump supporter signs out there. And this leads to a larger question, Jim. They're still in the downtown core. Police just released a statement saying, look, we need the trucks to leave, we need people to leave, this city has to start functioning again, and the issue is how to leave. The people who have organized this say that they will stay out there months if needed.   JIM ACOSTA CNN:  All right. And we know you'll stay on top of it. Alarming situation there in Ottawa. … thank you very much.   ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ BANS MAINSTREAM MEDIA FROM FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE: ‘SABOTAGE’ Now we don't know who that woman is, but she should be completely ashamed of herself. She's a journalist, and yet she just told you that the ruling party of Canada wants the people who are protesting their policies to leave. And then she nods gravely that they need to leave. Things need to get back to normal. They've got to run the city doing all the important things that Canadians do in Ottawa. CNN is siding openly with the Trudeau government, because you can't challenge power. I mean, that's what we do in the media is to remind you: Obey, accept your fate, rich people have spoken, get in line. And we've got a Trump flag to prove it.  But it gets worse. There were more racist flags this weekend. One of them imported conspicuously from this country. Now we have definitive evidence of this. We're getting this from Canadian media that there was a racist in the crowd.  TWITTER VIDEO (to a man holding a confederate flag):  But now he's going, now he's gone. We called him out. He knows he's going to hold his head in shame now.   Oh, it's so great. You'll notice in the shot there's only one person who has his face completely covered. And he happens to be carrying a Confederate flag. Now the crowd looks at him and says, oh, wait a second, we know who you are, you're Ray Epps. Oh, sorry, but we don't trust you. In exactly the way the crowd in Washington the night before January 6th of last year said to Ray Epps, Get out of here, fed.

       So the people on the scene didn't believe that guy was anything but a provocateur, and we don't know exactly who he was. We'll let you make your own conclusions from that. But we're supposed to believe that this one guy in the full face mask with a Confederate flag proves the entire protest is racist. Justin Trudeau has every reason to run away like a terrified, wuss that he is, and we can ignore the concerns of the people in the trucker convoy. But we've got a couple of questions.  Who exactly was that guy holding the flag and where is Justin Trudeau right now? It's not clear where he was broadcasting from this weekend, but what is clear is that unlike Saddam or Moammar Gadhafi, we're never going to be able to find out.  Now you think to yourself in a democracy, you should know what the head of state is, right? Don't you have a right if you're a voter, shouldn't Canadians have a right to know where he is? Yeah, but it doesn't matter because Justin Trudeau can hide anywhere. He's a master of disguise. Any place in the world Justin Trudeau could blend in, and you'd never know it was him.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   And to prove it, we have a series of photographs. All of them are real, and all of them depict the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. You can see him looking very much not like a French Canadian, looking pretty dark, actually. This is an Arabian Nights-themed gathering when he was a high school teacher. Oh, he's got Black face on. Interesting. You can also see him blending in convincingly as a Bollywood star in India. Hands grasp together in reverence and prayer. Or, you can see him flanked by his new countrymen, they have no idea they're in the presence of a Canadian politician. That's how convincing Justin Trudeau is when he decides to play dress-up. They think he's one of them. I love samosas, Justin says. We do, too, say the Indians. They have no idea they're talking to a Canadian. But when he's not fooling people in India, he's fooling Native Americans. And yes, there is a difference bigot. Not all Indians are the same. Justin Trudeau wore the traditional headdress of one of Canada's many indigenous tribes, like the Aztecs, Justin Trudeau will rip your heart out, ladies. And, is that Clark Kent of Superman fame? No, once again, is just Justin Trudeau.  He can impersonate fictional characters. You can see him looking like a stranded pilot in the desert from one of the Star Wars movies. He could literally be hiding on a soundstage in Hollywood as we speak. He can even be on a ranch. Unbelievable. As long as no one hands him a gun or asked him where food comes from, that's a convincing rancher right there. So, yes, Justin Trudeau can change far more than his skin color. If you see that man in any of his various disguises, do not approach him. He might be hiding in a nondescript cabin in the middle of nowhere, but he's very much in control of Ottawa, at least for the moment.  "
Sean Hannity reacts to the Joe Rogan Spotify controversy,Charles Creitz," January 31, 2022 11:35pm EST","  close     Video    Hannity: How did we get to this point?   Fox News host weighs in on protests over the vaccine mandates and demands for Joe Rogan to be canceled on 'Hannity.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   In his  Opening Monologue  on Monday,  Sean Hannity  questioned how Canadian-American singer/songwriter Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World"" anthem could ring true anymore if the performer is giving streaming services ultimatums based on others' freedom of thought. Young, recently told Spotify if they continue to broadcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" he does not want his music on the service. The company later complied and pulled the ""Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young"" musician's library from their archive.     
      Musician Neil Young speaks during a session at the International CES Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2015, in Las Vegas.
       (AP Photo/John Locher) Hannity  said that while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reportedly fled Ottawa and bashed the truckers protesting vaccine injection mandates, Rogan is under fire for simply allowing contrasting views on that topic to be discussed on his popular podcast. ""How do we repay the heroes of the pandemic? The nurses, the doctors, you know, people with natural immunity now being forced out of their jobs because they won't get the vaccine?"" he said. ""Look at Joe Rogan, by the way the most listened to podcast in the country,"" he added.     
      Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host on Spotify, has emerged as Public Enemy No.1 among liberals.
       (Photo by Michael S.

Rogan has often spoken about the importance of open discourse, and on the political front was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the 2020 elections.  For his part, Sanders similarly  received backlash  after Rogan, 54, voiced support for him at the time. ""Rogan dared to interview Dr. Robert Malone … a world-renowned physician who is the chief architect of the mRNA technology for the vaccines. Let me be clear, Dr. Malone played a key pivotal role in developing the technology so we can have mRNA viruses,"" Hannity said. Malone has been largely censored by Big Tech for criticizing some aspects of the mRNA vaccines – which include Moderna and Pfizer -- in terms of its effect on coronavirus. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Malone is a frequent critic of mass hysteria surrounding COVID-19. He has more stringent guidelines in terms of who should be getting the vaccine,"" Hannity said. He added that, in contrast, the rocker Young seemed to bristle at Rogan's free discourse: ""Now we have old washed-up rock stars around the country like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell demanding Spotify censor Joe Rogan, or they can't play their music,"" he said. ""What happened to Neil Young anyway? What happened to ‘Rockin in the Free World’ -- you might remember?"" ""Not so free anymore.""  "

   Truckers are a unique breed. There are very few jobs in modern Western life quite so solitary as  driving a huge vehicle  across the mostly barren landscapes of North America. Miles of road are coursed under heavy tires and light, thoughtful minds free to linger on their own devices. So the  anti-vaccine-mandate protest  initiated by these modern-day cowboys in Canada is worth paying attention to. These are people who know a thing or two about freedom. In fact, they base their whole life around it.     
      Protesters and supporters against a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers cheer as a parade of trucks and vehicles pass through Kakabeka Falls outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario, on Wednesday, Jan. 26, 2022.
       (David Jackson/The Canadian Press via AP) What is most telling about the reaction to the protest is the disdain being shown to these truckers by their own government and many in the media.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  has dismissed the effort, and apparently gone into hiding as the big rigs surround the capital of Ottawa. He claims that these men and women hold ""unacceptable views."" Heaven forbid. CRITICS MOCK ‘PUPPET’ TRUDEAU FOR FLEEING CAPITAL DURING TRUCKERS PROTEST: ‘TYRANT ON THE RUN’ You see, for politicians like Trudeau and so many leftists in Canada and the United States, it's not really COVID they are worried about. It's the idea that some people, specifically people who work for a living and aren’t slaves to their handouts, have the audacity not only to disagree with them, but also to ignore them.   Video Pandemic restrictions and mandates galore are easy to impose on urban dwellers with office and service jobs. They can be and have been crushed with the flick of a governor’s pen. But denizens of the open road, without whom our modern miracle of an existence screeches to a hungry standstill, are not so easy to control.   Video Most of us in the influencer class, the politicians and pundits, leaders of business and those unsung heroes, Hollywood celebrities, don’t think very much about how things actually get done. Toilets flush, thanks to plumbers, houses are built, thanks to carpenters, and yes, store shelves are stocked (at least they used to be) thanks to truckers. The better sort of people, with their degrees and acceptable views don’t generally have to think much about any of this. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But what the Canadian truck protest shows is that this is a two-way highway. The truckers are just as free to ignore the elites as the elites are to ignore the truckers. The key difference being that the elites don’t produce much beyond noisy chatter.   Video Over the past week, it has been noticed that the very influencers and outlets who have spent two years lecturing in favor of lockdowns have come to a ""now it can be said"" moment. Maybe kids shouldn’t be wearing masks at school, the New York Times and The Atlantic suddenly opine. Perhaps there is nuance, we now hear from the buttery voices of NPR.  Part of this is because lockdowns have led to embarrassingly bad poll numbers for the favorite party of the elite, but there is something deeper. There is an emerging recognition that regular people, the ones who actually do things and make society function, are under no obligation to listen to the bleatings of the supposedly powerful. Maybe freedom isn’t dead after all.

But that time ain’t yet. For now, with the turn of a key, they can threaten those who seek to control them. It's a valuable lesson.  When those who choose to live a solitary existence, who wish power over no one but themselves, decide to speak out, it is worth listening. And if the politicians listen carefully they will learn something important. They work for the truckers. The truckers do not work for them. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS  "
How Joe Rogan became Public Enemy No. 1 to media liberals in the battle over COVID 'misinformation',Brian Flood," February 1, 2022 6:00am EST","  close     Video   Joe Rogan breaks silence on Spotify controversy over COVID content   Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley discusses free speech and private censorship on 'America Reports.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Podcast star Joe Rogan has emerged as  Public Enemy No.1 among media liberals  after being accused of peddling misinformation about  COVID-19 , and the former sitcom star took an unlikely path to being despised by the left.  ""Joe Rogan is a liberal, but it almost doesn't matter what he is politically. The biggest difference between Rogan and the consensus pushers in the legacy media is that he's curious - he approaches topics with humility and interest, and brings deep conversations to his audience without drilling into their heads how they should think,""  Fourth Watch  editor Steve Krakauer told Fox News Digital.  ""It's the antithesis of our arrogant gatekeepers, who spend so much energy attempting to convince their audience how they should think and feel, to the detriment of their own credibility,"" Krakauer continued. ""Has Rogan hosted conversations on his podcast where guests, or he, have made dubious statements? Absolutely. But the difference between Rogan and the establishment press is these statements are made not in the context of a veneer of absolute truth, but in a free-flowing exchange of ideas and conversation."" JOE ROGAN BREAKS SILENCE AFTER NEIL YOUNG'S SPOTIFY CONTROVERSY     
      Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host on Spotify, has emerged as Public Enemy No.1 among liberals.
       (Photo by Michael S. Schwartz/Getty Images) Rogan rose to fame years before Spotify shelled out a reported $100 million to bring his podcast to the digital music streaming platform. He spent years as a successful standup comedian, had a mid-90s stint on NBC’s ""NewsRadio"" alongside the late Phil Hartman, hosted the reality TV hit ""Fear Factor"" and has been an Ultimate Fighting Championship announcer for two decades.   He launched ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" in 2010, and it quickly developed a following for its discussions about entertainment, current events, politics, comedy and just about everything else the namesake host found interesting.  By 2015, ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" topped 11 million monthly downloads and the comedian-turned-actor-turned-UFC announcer-turned-reality TV host was suddenly more famous for his podcast than anything else. He says the success happened organically, and he never intended to conquer what is essentially modern talk radio.  ""It just sort of f-----g happened,"" he  said in 2016 .  Four years later at the beginning of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Spotify announced it would bring ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" exclusively to its platform. That same year, Rogan declared he would ""probably vote for Bernie"" Sanders, the iconoclastic left-wing Vermont U.S. Senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination. NEIL YOUNG'S SPOTIFY BOYCOTT OVER JOE ROGAN CONTENT BACKED BY WHO DIRECTOR-GENERAL Rogan’s quasi-endorsement of Sanders resulted in backlash from the left, as liberal were irked that Sanders touted his support. However, the liberals were not annoyed because of Rogan’s politics, instead claiming he made ""racist, homophobic and transphobic comments"" throughout his career.  A CNN article reporting backlash to Sanders’ campaign boasting about Rogan’s support described the podcast star as ""a libertarian-leaning broadcaster,"" and cited past use of the N-word and his speaking out that transgender MMA fighters shouldn’t be allowed to fight biological women as why he was considered problematic at the time.      
      Liberal pundits have urged the streaming platform for take action against ""misinformation"" spread by Joe Rogan. 
       (YouTube) ""The decision to highlight Rogan's support has divided opinion among Democrats and activists, particularly online, where it has sparked a heated debate over whether Sanders should have aligned himself with Rogan in any form or context,"" CNN reported at the time.  Far-left group MoveOn even  asked Sanders to apologize  for elevating Rogan’s endorsement.  A mere two years after Rogan first annoyed progressives simply by saying he’d vote for a self-described Democratic socialist, the ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" is seen as the face of COVID ""misinformation"" by many outspoken lefties.  JOE ROGAN TORCHES CNN AMID CHRIS CUOMO SCANDAL: 'F---ING PROPAGANDISTS' WHOSE 'RATINGS ARE DOGS---' Rogan has claimed he isn’t anti-vaccine, but has also suggested healthy young people simply don’t need it, which doesn’t sit well with many liberals. After backlash, Rogan clarified on a later episode: ""I’m not a doctor, I’m a f--king moron, and I’m a cage-fighting commentator who’s a dirty stand-up comedian … I’m not a respected source of information — even for me."" However, that wasn’t the last time Rogan found himself discussing COVID on his show.  In June 2021, Rogan’s guest, biologist Bret Weinstein, said ""ivermectin alone, if properly utilized, is capable of driving this pathogen to extinction."" Months later, Rogan announced he tested positive for COVID himself and was using ivermectin to help combat the virus.  ""We immediately threw the kitchen sink at it. All kinds of meds,"" Rogan explained in September. ""Monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, Z-pak, prednisone, everything. And I also got an anti-D drip and a vitamin drip."" The liberal media quickly began criticizing Rogan, accusing him of pushing ivermectin on his loyal fan base. The drug was a hot topic at the time, as it is often used to treat animals. But Rogan insisted three days of his ""kitchen sink"" strategy helped him recover quickly.  ""Here we are on Wednesday and I feel great,"" Rogan explained at the time. ""I really only had one bad day. Sunday sucked, but Monday was better, Tuesday felt better than Monday and today, I feel good … I actually feel pretty f--king good."" Rogan has also insisted people who have antibodies don’t always need the vaccine, is an outspoken critic of lockdowns and interviewed controversial Dr. Peter McCullough. Last month, Rogan suggested the risk of myocarditis among vaccinated people age 12-17 was higher than the risk of contracting COVID, but was quickly fact-checked by Australian broadcaster Josh Szeps. JOY BEHAR REJECTS JOE ROGAN'S APOLOGY FOLLOWING PODCAST CRITICISM: 'I DON'T KNOW THAT HE CAN BE REFORMED' As Rogan spoke about COVID more frequently, he transitioned from a comedian who made controversial comments on occasion to an influential podcast host who must be silenced in the eyes of many liberals. The Daily Beast enlisted a far-left advocate to declare Rogan was ""mainstreaming right-wing information,"" and liberal musicians have pulled their music from Spotify to protest his thoughts on COVID treatment and rhetoric by recent guests.  ""The anti-speech activists in the media hate Rogan because they fear him,"" Krakauer said. ""Because if an audience can be empowered to think for themselves by a media personality who refuses to tell people what to think, what do they need the mainstream press for?""     
      ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" launched in 2010 and it quickly developed a passionate following. (Photo by Michael S. Schwartz/Getty Images)
       (Michael S. Schwartz/Getty Images) Last month, a group of advocates  signed an open letter  that asked Spotify to ""take action against mass-misinformation events"" on its platform after Rogan's ""highly controversial episode"" with Dr. Robert Malone, which seemed to be the last straw for many of Rogan’s staunch critics.  Social media platforms reacted in panic after Malone’s interview with Rogan, in which he applied a theory from Professor Mattias Desmet suggesting how a large population can be sent into ""mass formation psychosis.""  The video was swiftly removed from YouTube, while Malone believes Google search results were also affected. The open letter blasted Rogan for pushing ""misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine"" during the ongoing COVID pandemic and noted that Dr. Malone has been suspended from Twitter for spreading misinformation about COVID.   Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann last week called Rogan the ""stupidest f-----g guy on the planet"" after he interviewed Malone. CNN invited a health care professional who signed the letter to amplify it on the network’s struggling morning show ""New Day,"" where co-host Brianna Keilar mocked Rogan for ""moving the goalposts"" after he was fact-checked in real time by Szeps.  Rogan has since been criticized by everyone from  Meghan Markle  and  Prince Harry  to musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, who pulled their music catalogs from Spotify in an act of protest against his COVID rhetoric.  ""While unsurprising, it's still amazing that someone like Joe Rogan has become the subject of such hatred and venom from the leftists media and their allies in academic and public medicine. Rogan has drawn such strong levels of invective for simply going against the ruling class on issues such as COVID-19 and, more broadly, the classically liberal principles of free, open, and rigorous debate with diversity in thought,"" NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.  ""Despite having had a long career in Hollywood and supported politicians like Bernie Sanders, none of his past behaviors are enough in the eyes of today's left. It's conform or be silenced. It's twisted and, quite frankly, lame brained for them to voice support for free speech and the First Amendment but insist Rogan shouldn't be allowed to have a prominent platform,"" Houck continued. ""It's not only important to point out how he's not to be confused with a conservative, but it's almost an imperative to illustrate just how authoritarian and close-minded too many on the left have become."" CNN has particularly feuded with Rogan; the two sides feuded when Rogan took ivermectin to tread COVID-19 and the liberal outlet ran the narrative that he had taken ""horse dewormer"" and a ""livestock drug."" Rogan fired back in an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that his network was ""lying"" and Gupta conceded some of CNN's people had misspoken. During a headline-making appearance on Rogan’s podcast, Gupta pointed to the ""snarky"" statement released by the FDA saying, ""You are not a horse. You are not a cow,"" in order to encourage people to not take ivermectin, but Rogan remained persistent on calling out CNN's coverage of a drug that's been ""given out to billions and billions of people"" and resulted in a Nobel Prize. Rogan first told Gupta that his ivermectin was ""prescribed to me by a doctor,"" forcing the CNN correspondent to say the drug ""shouldn't be called"" horse dewormer. The fight continued when CNN fumed in a statement to the Washington Post that Rogan had undermined faith in effective vaccines, adding ""the only thing CNN did wrong here was bruise the ego of a popular podcaster who pushed dangerous conspiracy theories."" The Post's Erik Wemple wrote at the time that the statement from CNN ""sounds more like the work of an advocacy group than a journalism outfit.""

   COVID-19  patients may not need to wait long after being infected to know if they will develop post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), also known as long COVID, according to a paper published this week in  Nature Communications .  ""We want to be able to recognize and identify, as early as possible, who is at risk of developing long COVID,"" said Dr. Onur Boyman, a co-author of the  study  and researcher in the department of immunology at University Hospital  Zurich .  ""The most frequent symptoms of long COVID are reported to be fatigue, dyspnea [shortness of breath], and cognitive impairment (also termed 'brain fog,' which includes loss of concentration and memory), as well as pain and aches at different sites (including headache), cough, change in smell or taste, and diarrhea,"" the study  said .      
      For some COVID-19 patients, the symptoms persist.
       (iStock) The syndrome has also been referenced as ""long-haul COVID"" or ""post-COVID syndrome"" for patients who have been infected with COVID-19 but continue to experience long-term side effects and symptoms, according to the Mayo  Clinic .  ""Estimates show that 10%–30% of people who become infected with COVID-19 will end up coming down with long-haul COVID,"" says Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, medical director of Mayo Clinic's COVID Activity Rehabilitation  Program .   The  World Health Organization  defines the syndrome as symptoms that persist for usually at least three months after a patient gets COVID-19 without finding any alternative  diagnosis , but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines it more generally under ""post-COVID conditions"" that patients experience four or more weeks after being infected with  COVID-19 .  ‘STEALTH’ OMICRON VARIANT BA.2 CIRCULATING IN ALMOST HALF OF US, BUT CDC EXERCISES CAUTION: REPORT  The Swiss researchers defined long COVID for their study as the persistence of one or more COVID-19 related symptoms for more than four weeks after the start of their first COVID-19 related symptom.  The team evaluated the medical histories of 175 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and compared them to 40 healthy patients without COVID-19 for the duration of the one-year study, finding 82.2% with severe infections had long COVID versus 53.9% of patients with mild infections, using the World Health Organization classification for a mild or severe COVID-19 infection.  The authors found patients who developed long COVID had lower levels of IgM and IgG3 antibodies, which help fight infections in the bloodstream, throughout the disease compared to those with milder  infections .   The authors termed this antibody response an ""immunoglobulin signature,"" because unlike inflammatory markers that only transiently increase early in the course of the  disease , the detected antibodies are stable over time, which makes them attractive biomarkers.      
      The syndrome has also been referenced as ""long-haul COVID"" or ""post-COVID syndrome"" 
       ( iStock) When they combined this ""signature"" with the participant’s age, past medical history of asthma and five particular symptoms during primary infection, the researchers were 75% effective in being able to predict the risk of long COVID, regardless of when the patient’s blood was sampled.   CASES OF ‘STEALTH’ OMICRON SUBVARIANT CONFIRMED IN NORTHEAST STATES: REPORTS NBC News Digital reported, however, because the study was conducted between April 2020 and August 2021, a time before omicron was not known to be circulating, it is unclear if the findings apply to patients now, as over 99% all COVID-19 cases in the United States are secondary to omicron, according to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention .  Dr. Claire Steves, a senior clinical lecturer at King's College London, noted an additional limitation of the study was it did not take into account the participants’ vaccination status.  ""It would be important to look to see whether these markers are still predictive in vaccinated people as more of the world is  vaccinated  or has prior infection.""      
      The study authors found that the majority of the patients studied — about 75% — did not experience symptoms of COVID-19 when they had a coronavirus infection. However, when the patients later developed MIS-C, typically some two to five weeks later, fever was among the most common symptoms, the CDC analysis found. 
       (iStock) She noted another key limitation was the study’s definition of long COVID-19, which defined the syndrome as lingering symptoms for greater than four weeks, which contrasts with the international consensus to focus more on persistent symptoms lasting more than 12  weeks .  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS ""With cases high still, more people are at risk of developing long-term  symptoms .  We urgently need to scale up research on how to prevent this happening. Tools such as these predictive models could be used to identify people at higher risk for enrollment into research trials for therapeutics,"" Steves added.   "

   Ottawa,  Canada ,  police  is launching a ""hate crime"" hotline Tuesday despite its chief admitting that the first four days of anti- vaccine- mandate  protests ushered into the capital by a ""Freedom Convoy"" of truckers have remained largely peaceful and have resulted in no riots, injuries or deaths.  At a virtual press conference Monday evening, Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly lamented the ""massive traffic chaos and gridlock"" that have persisted since Friday when tens of thousands of people flooded into the downtown corridor to protest the latest requirement for truckers returning to Canada from the U.S. to show proof of vaccination, as well as other grievances over coronavirus-related restrictions.  ""This is a demonstration unique in nature, massive in scale, polarizing in context, dangerous in literally every aspect of the event itself,"" Sloly said. ""This started on the west coast of Canada and spread across the country. It has been fluid, ever-changing and increasingly more difficult to manage.""  CANADA PM TRUDEAU, FAMILY MOVE TO ‘UNDISCLOSED’ LOCATION AMID ‘FREEDOM’ TRUCKER VACCINE PROTESTS: REPORT  In thanking law enforcement for operating as thousands of vehicles clogged highways and bridges outside the city, the chief stressed that there have been no riots or injuries linked to the demonstrations. Sloly said emergency services were delayed amid the large crowds but reports of denial of service were not true.  ""They have been an incredible group of individuals who’ve kept this city safe during a situation that could have become riotous, it could have led to significant and severe injuries, and it could have led to the loss of life,"" Sloly said. ""None of that has occurred over the last four days.""

Sloly said several criminal investigations are ongoing for bribery, threats, assaults and dangerous operation of vehicles.  He also warned that drivers participating in the protests with license plates from other provinces could still be tracked down and prosecuted once leaving the capital.  ""Within the next 24 hours we are going to be creating a hotline for hate incidents – hate crimes, any offenses directly related to the demonstrations, including criminal offenses, threats, assaults, hate-related crimes, mischiefs, anything that any member of the community, any visitor, any demonstrator has faced in terms of criminal activity,"" he said, ""A hotline will be established to receive those reports.

   More than 100 plaintiffs who live and work in the  New Orleans  area are  suing  Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the city's health department over its  COVID-19  vaccine and mask mandates. The city last month announced that by Feb. 1, all individuals ages 5 and older would have to show proof of at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine or a negative PCR or antigen test to enter certain businesses, though a vaccine mandate went into effect for adults on Jan. 3. Additionally, all individuals 2 years old and older must wear masks indoors. ""The people of New Orleans and our children have endured nearly two years of unprecedented control from our so-called city leaders,"" attorney Laura Cannizzaro Rodrigue, a partner at the New Orleans-based firm Rodriguez & Arcuri, told Fox News Digital of the complaint. ""What started as a temporary means to protect the community from unknown risks of a virus has turned into a circus of mandates that no longer make sense to any rational person. Enough is enough. People all over our great State who live, work, and worship in New Orleans are united in this effort to take back control of their lives and families."" The complaint filed by Rodrigue & Arcuri and attorney Jimmy Faircloth of Faircloth, Melton, Sobel & Bash LLC, on behalf of more than 100 plaintiffs — and counting — accuses the mayor and the health department, including New Orleans Health Director Jennifer Avengno, of causing ""social, economic and cultural harm"" through ‘authoritarian actions under the pretext of an emergency without end.""  OMICRON VARIANT INCREASES CONCERNS ABOUT LONG COVID The lawsuit accuses defendants of violating plaintiffs' privacy rights and denying plaintiffs' equal protection under New Orleans law. The complaint filed in an Orleans Parish Civil District Court includes data showing how the omicron variant of COVID-19 has  proven its ability  to evade immunity offered by vaccines. While the vaccine  prevents severe reactions  to the virus — particularly in the elderly and those with underlying conditions — U.S. cases have spiked to record highs in recent weeks as the virus infects both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

       ""Simply put, the risk posed by Omicron to most people—especially children—is de minimis, far below the risks posed by many other diseases and activities of daily life,"" the lawsuit states. ""For example, the risk to a New Orleans resident or visitor of injury in an automobile or of being the victim of violent crime…is greater than the risk of severe illness from the Omicron variant."" AS HOMICIDES SPIKE IN US CITIES, NEW ORLEANS CHURCH REMEMBERS VICTIMS WITH A ‘MURDER BORAD' It also states that ""prior to the rise of the Delta Variant, it was wrongly assumed that the COVID Vaccines would protect against both infection and transmission of the disease, like traditional vaccines such as those developed for small pox, measles, mumps, chicken pox, and rubella."" The complaint goes on to list a series of mandates and directives imposed by city officials over the last two years related to COVID-19 mitigation efforts, as Fox 8 New Orleans  first reported .

       The New Orleans Department of Health did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital. The mayor will be holding a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. In addition, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry is threatening legal action over the city's mandates, which he says are destroying businesses and killing jobs.

Average daily deaths have remained lower than they were between March and April 2020, and between November and February 2021. The U.S. is recording an average of just under 2,000 deaths per day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says unvaccinated individuals are four times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 15 times more likely to die of the virus, though unvaccinated individuals over the age of 65 have a much higher risk of severe reaction to COVID-19 than younger, unvaccinated individuals.

""Make no mistake - Governor Kathy Hochul, New York State Department of Education, and Mayfield Central School District, this is unconstitutional, and I join the community in fully standing behind and supporting this teacher's First Amendment constitutional rights,"" Stefanik wrote. Of particular scorn in the statement was Gov. Hochul and her administration's continued mask mandates and COVID-19 guidelines. ""Not only are New York's teachers forced to comply with Hochul's unscientific and abusive mandates negatively impacting students, including those with special needs, but they are also then illegally punished for sharing their personal opinions about the detrimental impacts these polices may have on their students,"" Stefanik said. The school district has so far failed to produce a record of the social media post that justified Lizzio's termination, but steadfastly denies it was related to Stefanik. ""While we typically do not comment on personnel matters, the information Ms. Stefanik posted is misleading and inaccurate,"" a MCSD spokesperson said in a statement to reporters. ""Ms. Stefanik’s allegation that a teacher has been placed on administrative leave for ‘sharing one of her Facebook posts’ regarding the mask mandate also is inaccurate.""

""Members of the military are required to get numerous other vaccines and the COVID vaccine should be absolutely no different,"" MRFF President Michael Weinstein told Fox News Digital via email.

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The daughter of a former South Florida mayor who recently ran for Congress has been sentenced to prison for lying to obtain $300,000 in  COVID-19 relief funds . Damara Holness on Monday was ordered to report to federal prison by noon on April 25 to serve a 20-month sentence for the Paycheck Protection Program fraud. The program was designed to keep businesses afloat during the pandemic. The judge on Monday also sentenced Holness, daughter of former Broward County Mayor Dale Holness, to five years of supervised release. She pleaded guilty in November, a day after a  Democratic primary  for a U.S. House seat that her father ended up losing by five votes. ""The defendant saw this as an opportunity to unjustly enrich herself by defrauding the program designed to help those struggling businesses,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Kaplan wrote in court records. Damara Holness’ lawyer, Sue-Ann Robinson, said it ""was more an act of desperation than greed."" She said some of the money went toward ""housing arrangements"" and taxes. Holness apologized to the community, the government and to her family, the  South Florida SunSentinel  reported. She noted that she's affected her father's career. Dale Holness said his daughter has ""accepted responsibility for her mistake. We’re all human. She’s acknowledged it.""     According to court records, Damara Holness, 28, applied for the loan for her company, Holness Consulting. The application claimed that the company had an average monthly payroll $120,000 in 2019 for its 18 employees. The business was incorporated in November 2018 before becoming inactive. ""The defendant reinstated the business on June 22, 2020, in order to obtain the PPP loan. The business had no employees and virtually no income,"" the prosecutor wrote in court documents. Prosecutors said Holness spent months creating a paper trail after receiving the money.     
      
       (iStock) Court documents showed she paid 22 people, including a school bus driver and a security guard, about $1,300 every two weeks. Once they cashed the checks, the ""employees"" kept $300 and returned the rest to Holness. Defense attorneys  urged the judge to give her a lenient sentence because she cooperated with investigators and she has a young child. Prosecutors asked for a sentence between 33 and 41 months ""to promote respect for the law."" They also noted that Holness committed the crimes while pregnant and was ""well aware that she was giving birth and that if she was caught that she could go to jail.""  "

Hotez has become a common recurring guest on MSNBC, the host noted, calling him a ""crazed publicity addict"" and suggesting Baylor University reconsider allowing him to spout off about medicine on television.

The researchers also examined studies that focused on specific lockdown measures and found that the only intervention that reduced COVID-19 mortality was the closure of non-essential businesses, which reduced mortality by 10.6%, but this effect was likely driven by the closure of bars.

Stanford medical professor argues masking and social distancing doing long-term damage to our immune systems,Brandon Gillespie," February 2, 2022 9:20am EST","  close     Video   Media top headlines February 2   In media news today, Whoopi Goldberg gets suspended from ‘The View’ following remarks on the Holocaust, a Washington Post reporter compares COVID-19 deaths to murder victims, and Fox News becomes the first cable news network to finish No. 1 for 20 straight years. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Dr. Eran Bendavid, associate professor of medicine at Stanford University, is making the case that continued masking and social distancing as measures to fight the  coronavirus pandemic  are actually doing long-term damage to our immune systems.  In a Tuesday op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Bendavid argued that the policies put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus needed to be re-evaluated because they were reducing people's exposure to microbes, therefore preventing the immune system from training well against other diseases. TUCKER CARLSON SLAMS COVID ‘NUTCASE FROM BAYLOR’ PETER HOTEZ FOR ‘DISCREDITING AMERICAN MEDICINE’ ""Maintaining good health is often a balancing act. Too much food and we develop obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Too little food and we see stunting and wasting,"" Bendavid wrote. ""This kind of equilibrium applies to our interactions with bacteria, viruses, parasites and other microbes. Too much exposure to some microbes leads to disease, and so does too little."" ""The intensification of hygienic policies with the advent of Covid-19 was understandable. But long-term masking, deep cleaning, distancing and isolation can be harmful to health, especially for children, precisely because it reduces exposure to microbes. Hygiene practices have health risks as well as benefits,"" he added.  Bendavid wrote that one of civilization's greatest accomplishments was the ""great escape"" from infectious disease, in that diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid fever, polio and smallpox were tamed by clean drinking water, vaccinations, antibiotics and sanitation. Despite this, he noted, antiseptic populations were seeing increasing levels of asthma, allergies, Type 1 diabetes, Crohn’s disease and other diseases with a significant autoimmune component.

The immune system gets the most effective tuning during childhood, and reducing its ability to distinguish disease-causing invaders from benign targets is a common mechanism proposed for allergies, asthma and immune-mediated bowel diseases, among others,"" he added.

"Fauci's gain-of-function conspiracy and why I'll continue to hold him, his allies accountable",Sen. Rand Paul," February 2, 2022 6:00am EST","  close     Video   Dr. Fauci places blame for death threats on Rand Paul in tense Senate hearing   Senator Rand Paul asks questions to NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci during a Senate committee hearing. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   In January, I asked  Dr. Anthony Fauci  a pretty basic question: ""Do you really think it’s appropriate to use your $420,000 salary to attack scientists that you disagree with?"" Given Dr. Fauci’s theatrical outburst and deflection in response to my question, I think I hit a nerve. Answering that question truthfully, which he is legally compelled to do when speaking before  Congress , would have meant illuminating the deceitful game he and National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins have been playing about  COVID ’s origins and their support of the type of dangerous research that could have led to the pandemic. FOX NEWS ‘SPECIAL REPORT’ OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN How ironic that the frantic efforts by Fauci and Collins to label esteemed scientists as ""fringe"" and ""conspiracy theorists"" for daring to suggest that COVID came from a lab was actually a sinister conspiracy of their own. They diligently worked with Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance – which was a recipient of NIH funds to study bat coronaviruses and the potential risks to humans at a lab located in  China –  to discredit those who deign to question their conclusions. This triumvirate of gain-of-function research cheerleaders worked with their allies to, in the words of Collins, ""take down"" scientists from Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford for simply considering the merits of a lab leak theory.   Video Why such aggressive behavior toward their scientific colleagues? One reason is that their gain-of-function research, funded by your tax dollars, was at stake. Dr. Fauci has been a longtime supporter of this type of research. Gain-of-function research is conducted by taking a known virus and conducting experiments to create new  viruses  that are not found in nature. Our government’s bureaucrats brutally squashed any attempt to discover the truth of the origins of the virus   Despite Dr. Fauci’s ducking and dodging when I’ve asked him about his funding of gain-of-function research in China, we have the receipts.  The agency Dr. Fauci heads, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), awarded a grant (Project Number 1R01AI110964-01) with a subcontract to the Wuhan Lab of Virology, where researchers combined a gene from one SARS-related coronavirus with the genetic information of another SARS-related coronavirus and constructed new coronaviruses that infected human cells. That is gain-of-function, and plenty of scientists have called it as such.   Video Although the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown, its unique structure, specifically its furin cleavage site, which has not been found in natural coronaviruses, suggests it may have been developed through dangerous research of this kind. As former New York Times science editor Nicholas Wade recently reported, at first, because of the furin cleavage site, ""the virologists had little doubt that the virus bore the fingerprints of manipulation."" RAND PAUL CONTINUES PRESSING FAUCI FOR ANSWERS ON NIH GAIN-OF-FUNCTION FUNDING And this wasn’t the first time our government had heard about something like a furin cleavage site inserted into a coronavirus. In 2018, the Wuhan Lab submitted a proposal to DARPA to do just that, and the proposal was denied because of the danger of increasing human infectivity. To be clear, the virologists consulted in the early days of the pandemic immediately thought the lab leak theory was credible, and the lab where it could have come from happened to be a place where they performed dangerous (U.S. funded) gain-of-function research. That same lab had previously attempted to secure funding to create a virus with a very specific attribute – which was remarkably found in the novel coronavirus. That’s not a conspiracy, those are just facts. I do not know whether COVID-19 originated in a lab. My point is that our government’s bureaucrats brutally squashed any attempt to discover the truth of the origins of the virus because doing so conflicted with their self-interests.   Video While these virologists studying the virus made comments like, ""I just can’t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature…in the lab it would be easy to generate,"" and were struggling to explain the virus ""as an event outside the lab,"" we now know from recently released emails just how much Fauci and Collins were starting to panic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER ""The voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony,"" Collins wrote in an email. So, of course, despite the experts giving credible reasons as to why the virus might be manipulated by humans, he and Dr. Fauci conspired to shut them down.   According to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, a teleconference on February 1, 2020 led by Fauci and Collins made clear to the virologists on the call that talking about the lab leak theory, even if based in credible science, was ""politically unacceptable and something that had to be blocked."" Given the power that Fauci and Collins have to deny funding to these scientists, I’m not surprised the majority of them stayed silent. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What ensued in the following weeks was an all-out effort to discredit and silence anyone who dared to engage with the lab-leak theory. Many of the emails have been released publicly, and I encourage you to read them. Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins’ conspiracy to silence these scientists and bury the lab leak theory tells us one thing – they clearly prioritize dangerous gain-of-function research at a Chinese lab and their own behinds over the health and safety of the American people. I’ll continue my efforts to hold Fauci and his allies accountable. Gain-of-function research is too dangerous. When  Republicans  win the  Senate , we will not only investigate the origins of the virus but also investigate whether or not we should be sending taxpayer dollars to do research that could have caused this pandemic.

Virginia parents outraged as kids face school suspensions for going maskless: 'It symbolizes control now',Nikolas Lanum," February 2, 2022 11:25am EST","  close     Video   Virginia students face suspension for violating mask mandate despite Youngkin executive order   Loudoun county parent Clint Thomas and Fairfax county parent Stephanie Lundquist-Arora discuss the disciplinary action taken against their children as a court is set to hear the governor’s executive order.

   Virginia   parents  are calling out public  school  systems after students faced suspensions for failing to comply with mask mandates, despite  Governor Glenn Youngkin’s  executive order for schools to be mask-optional.  During a Wednesday appearance on  ""Fox & Friends First,""   Loudoun County  parent Clint Thomas said his daughters’ school is suspending National Honors Society students, community volunteers, and other student leaders such as his daughters for pushing back against ""woke"" educators defying the governor’s order.  ""We do feel like it is about control and grooming, and they’re excited to actually get the suspension if it means setting kids and teachers free all across our state,"" Thomas told co-host  Todd Piro. NEW JERSEY MOM CALLS OUT SCHOOL BOARD'S MASK HYPOCRISY: 'RULES FOR THEE AND NOT FOR ME' Thomas went on to say that his daughters plan on wearing their suspensions as a ""badge of honor"" symbolizing their fight for freedom and against progressive policies that could impact future generations. The Loudoun County father added that public schools have strayed away from ""true education.""   Video ""There are other places to get educated. We don’t have to subject ourselves to this,"" said Thomas. Meanwhile,  Fairfax County  mother Stephanie Lundquist-Arora says her sons have been suspended for the past week over a ""dress code violation,"" which Lundquist-Arora believes is a result of their school mask policy violation.  ""I think that [the school administrators] know they’re on shaky ground legally because they kind of put that bureaucratic nuance in to suspend them not just on a mask mandate—because I think they know that’s illegal,"" said Lundquist-Arora.  The Fairfax County mother said that what she loves about Youngkin’s mask-optional mandate is the same thing she loves about the Bill of Rights, which is ""putting power back into the hands of people."" ""Is this really about masks? I’m not sure that it is,"" added Lundquist-Arora. ""I think this is about tyranny versus freedom. I think the mask symbolizes control now.""   Video A third Virginia parent, Abbie Platt, told ""America's Newsroom"" co-host Bill Hemmer that her daughter was suspended from middle school for arriving without a mask. The young girl's father was allegedly told that it was ""his job"" to encourage his daughter to wear the mask and head into the school building.  ""[The principal] asked us, ‘what is your endgame?' And I said, look there is no game in this. This is not a game for us. I'm a mom. I want my children to be in class, to have in-person learning. They're playing politics with our children,"" Platt said Wednesday.  In a letter to parents, Blue Ridge Middle School said: ""A student who is suspended because of non-compliance with COVID-mitigation measures may return to school only when they agree to follow COVID-mitigation measures throughout the entire school day and at all indoor school-related events."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two dueling lawsuits are likely to add clarity to Youngkin’s order. Three families have filed a lawsuit against the Loudoun County school board for upholding a mask mandate, a direct violation of the order which allows parents to opt out of having their kids wear masks in schools.  On the other end of the spectrum, seven Virginia school boards have filed suit and are asking the Arlington Circuit court to immediately block the governor’s order, claiming that it violates Virginia state law.   "

Army Secretary Christine Wormuth issued the directive for commanders to initiate involuntary administrative separation proceedings.  ""Army readiness depends on Soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation’s wars,"" said Wormuth.

Overall, nearly 600 Marines, airmen and sailors have been thrown out of the military or dismissed from entry-level training at boot camps as of last week. According to the announcement, Wormuth's order applies to ""regular Army soldiers, reserve-component Soldiers serving on Title 10 active-duty, and cadets.""

   The federal trial of three former  Minneapolis   police officers  charged with violating  George Floyd’s  rights was abruptly suspended Wednesday after one defendant tested positive for  COVID-19. Judge Paul Magnuson said the trial for J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao won’t resume until Monday. They are accused of depriving Floyd of his rights when they failed to give him medical aid as Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on the Black man’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes while Floyd was handcuffed, facedown and gasping for air.  Kueng and Thao are also accused of failing to intervene in the May 2020 killing that triggered protests worldwide and a reexamination of racism and policing. The judge said that one of the defendants tested positive for COVID-19, but he didn’t specify who, and a news release from the courthouse identified the infected person only as a ""case participant."" Reporters in the courtroom said Kueng and Thao were present, while Lane was not. Lane’s attorney declined to say whether his client had COVID-19.

Testimony began last week after a jury was quickly selected Jan. 20. Magnuson ordered the selection of six alternates instead of the usual two in case any jurors become ill or have to drop out. To ensure social distancing, Magnuson set limits on who may be present in the courtroom. That includes allowing four pool reporters, plus a sketch artist, along with a limited number of family and friends of the officers and Floyd.

Masks are mandatory for most people in the courthouse, as they are in public buildings across St. Paul and neighboring Minneapolis. The judge made an exception for himself, citing a chronic lung condition, and for witnesses when they’re testifying, so that their voices aren’t muffled. He rejected a request from an emergency room doctor who wanted to keep his mask on while testifying. GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: MINNEAPOLIS TRAINING EXPERT TESTIFIES OFFICERS DID NOT FOLLOW TRAINING, DUTY The courthouse is otherwise closed and has been fenced off due to security concerns. Most other federal court proceedings in Minnesota are being conducted by video or teleconference due to the pandemic, while state courts are using a mix of in-person and remote proceedings. Like other places in the U.S., Minnesota saw an increase in cases as the highly contagious omicron variant took hold, but some key pandemic metrics have improved in recent weeks. According to data from the Minnesota Department of Health, the state’s positivity rate and new cases per 100,000 residents peaked around Jan. 11 at 23.6% and 238.6 cases, respectively and have fallen to 20.6% and 165.9 cases. New hospital admissions for COVID-19, a lagging indicator, are still close to their peak. Testimony so far has come from the government’s witnesses, with defense attorneys expected to call witnesses later. Lane’s attorney has said his client will testify, but it’s not known if the other officers will.

New Zealand to end quarantine stays and reopen its borders,Associated Press," February 2, 2022 10:43pm EST","  close     Video   Pregnant New Zealand journalist stuck in Afghanistan claims 'emergency allocation' was denied   New Zealand journalist Charlotte Bellis joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss why she cannot return to her home country and how she has sought refuge with the Taliban.

   New Zealand 's government on Thursday said it will end its quarantine requirements for incoming  travelers  and reopen its  borders , a change welcomed by thousands of citizens abroad who have endured long waits to return home. Since the start of the  pandemic , New Zealand has enacted some of the world's strictest border controls. Most incoming travelers need to spend 10 days in a quarantine hotel room run by the  military , a requirement that has created a bottleneck at the border. PREGNANT JOURNALIST GETS HELP FROM TALIBAN AFTER NEW ZEALAND DENIES REQUEST TO RETURN DUE TO COVID RULES The measures were initially credited with saving thousands of lives and allowed New Zealand to eliminate or control several outbreaks of the  coronavirus . But, increasingly, the border controls have been viewed as out-of-step in a world where the virus is becoming endemic, and in a country where the omicron variant is already spreading. The bottleneck forced many New Zealanders abroad to enter a lottery-style system to try and secure a spot in quarantine and passage home. The shortcomings of the system were highlighted over the past week by pregnant New Zealand journalist Charlotte Bellis, who was stranded in Afghanistan after New Zealand officials initially rejected her application to return home to give birth. After international publicity, officials backed down and offered her a spot in quarantine, which she has accepted.

       The border changes mean that vaccinated New Zealanders returning from  Australia  will no longer need to go into quarantine from the end of this month, and vaccinated New Zealanders returning from the rest of the world can skip quarantine by mid-March.

""There is no question that for New Zealand, it has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic,"" she said. ""But the reason that it is right up there as one of the toughest things we have experienced is, in part, because large-scale loss of life is not.""

       She said the controls ""meant not everyone could come home when they wanted to. But it also meant that COVID could not come in when it wanted to, either."" NEW ZEALAND BANS SMOKING Ardern said the restrictions had allowed New Zealand to build its defenses against the virus by achieving high levels of vaccination while also keeping the economy running strongly. About 77% of New Zealanders are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data. That rises to 93% among those aged 12 and over, according to health officials. New Zealand has reported just 53 virus deaths among its population of 5 million.

   Virginia   Gov.  Glenn Youngkin has broad power to issue executive orders overturning mask mandates in  schools , lawyers from the state Attorney General’s Office argued Wednesday, while lawyers for local school boards argued that the governor’s action usurps their authority. An Arlington County judge heard arguments from both sides in a lawsuit the school boards filed against Youngkin. She said she would issue a ruling soon. In the meantime, schools and parents are left with uncertainty. School boards across the state have refused to implement an executive order from the new  Republican  governor that not only overturns a statewide mask mandate, but also bars local jurisdictions from imposing a mandate on students.

       (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) VA CIRCUIT JUDGE ON SCHOOLS MASK MANDATE: 'IT'S ABOUT THE HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY' At Wednesday’s hearing, Deputy Attorney General Steven Popps argued that Youngkin is entitled to issue executive orders responding to the  coronavirus pandemic  just as his predecessor,  Democrat   Ralph Northam , did when he imposed a statewide school mask mandate. ""It should not matter whose name is on the executive order,"" Popps said. But John Cafferky, a lawyer for Alexandria Public Schools — one of seven school boards that jointly filed the lawsuit opposing Youngkin’s order — said Northam’s actions were justified because he was acting to preserve public health. Youngkin’s order, on the other hand, endangers public health, he argued. He said Youngkin is using powers designed to curtail public health crises to impose his personal philosophy that parents should decide whether their children wear masks. VIRGINIA FACES NEW LEGAL BATTLES OVER MASKING IN SCHOOLS ""The personal-choice rationale comes at the expense of schoolwide protection,"" Cafferky said. Cafferky also cited a state law that requires schools to adhere to guidelines from the Centers for  Disease  Control and Prevention to the extent practicable, and said those guidelines recommend universal masking. Popps, though, countered that no school board is able to adhere to every single CDC guideline. The CDC also has called for vaccinating all children age 5 and older, but no school board has seen fit to issue such a requirement, he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Circuit Court Judge Louise DiMatteo took the arguments under advisement after Wednesday’s hearing, but said she is cognizant of the need for a swift decision. Both sides have asked for an injunction that would likely apply statewide, either barring implementation of Youngkin’s order or requiring local school boards to implement it, depending on which way she rules. The lawsuit is one of several across the state related to the mask mandate and Youngkin’s executive order. Cases are also pending in Loudoun County and in front of the Virginia Supreme Court, but Wednesday’s hearing was the first to go before a judge.  "

""I’m not going to decide who’s right and who’s wrong on masking, this is really about the hierarchy of authority,"" said Judge DiMatteo.

Navy chaplain among sailors denied religious exemption to COVID-19 vaccine mandate: 'Kick in the gut',Jessica Chasmar," February 3, 2022 7:19am EST","  close     Video   Judge issues injunction, siding with Navy SEALs in vax mandate suit   First Liberty Institute general counsel Michael Berry joins 'The Story' with reaction NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   FIRST ON FOX:  A chaplain in the U.S.  Navy  Reserve said Wednesday that the military is being used by the  Biden  administration as a ""nice little test group"" that ""can't say no"" after he said he was denied a religious exemption to the  COVID-19  vaccine. The chaplain, who spoke with Fox News Digital on the condition of anonymity, said he faces possible dismissal from the Navy after nearly two decades of  service  due to his refusal to get a vaccine.  He would miss out on crucial retirement pay and benefits if he's dismissed before hitting the 20-year mark. MARINES’ CLAIM OF GRANTING 2 RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS ""It’s a kick in the gut for sure,"" the chaplain said. ""If I lose retirement benefits that way, that would be a pretty significant burden to me and my family. At the same time, this is a fight worth fighting. I do not think this is a lawful order.""

Darrell Issa told Fox New Digital. ""That the Biden mandate is trampling him along with our soldiers on the front lines makes crystal clear how wrong all this is."" The chaplain, who is also a pastor, said his religious exemption request was recommended for approval by his commanding officer and his commanding officer’s boss, but it was ultimately rejected ""at the top."" ""I was actually pleasantly surprised,"" he said. ""I thought my commander was going to be completely opposed to the request, but when I saw on the paperwork that he actually recommended approval and then his boss also recommended approval – I mean, to me, it's not about me, it's a big Navy thing. I think the commanders on the ground, many of them see this for what it is, but our hands are tied, and we have a lot of yes men at the top. It's really bad."" In addition to discussions with chaplains to determine whether they have a ""sincerely held belief,"" troops must meet with commanders and medical personnel, and then the final decision is made higher up the chain of command. The Navy has not approved any of the thousands of requests for religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine. The rejection letter the chaplain received from Vice Admiral John B. Nowell Jr., provided to Fox News Digital, said, ""Your request for religious accommodation through waiver of immunization requirements is disapproved."" ""A waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on your readiness and the readiness of the Sailors who serve alongside you in both operational and non-operational (including training) environments,"" the letter stated, in part. ""I find that disapproval of your request for a waiver of immunization requirements is the least restrictive means available to preserve the Department of Defense’s compelling interest in military readiness, mission accomplishment and the health and safety of military service members. ""The Navy is a specialized community governed by a discipline separate from that of the rest of society,"" the letter added. ""While every Sailor is welcome to express a religion of choice or none at all, our greater mission sometimes requires reasonable restrictions. You have my sincere best wishes for your continued success in your Navy career."" The chaplain said the letter of rejection was nearly identical to the other letters he’s seen. ""You can hold each of these up to the light, and they look exactly like everyone else,"" he said.  The chaplain pointed to the U.S. Marine Corps, which recently approved religious accommodations for three Marines while rejecting thousands more. MARINES SAY THEY’RE BEING ‘CRUSHED’ OVER VACCINE REFUSAL: ‘A POLITICAL PURGE’ One active-duty Marine with a legal background  who recently spoke with Fox News Digital  said the Corps granted those exemptions just to give the appearance that the religious rights of service members are being respected and to ""alleviate some of the pressure off of themselves."" That officer said, however, that the Corps has not disclosed exactly why those Marines’ requests were granted approval so that others can follow suit.

       (Carl Court/Getty Images) The officer said at least a ""dozen or so"" chaplains in the Marines have also been denied a religious exemption. ""That they're getting away with it just absolutely astounds me,"" the chaplain said. ""I would have thought that if you grant one, you have to grant everyone, because or else they are picking and choosing which religion is valid and who's Constitutional rights under the First Amendment will be honored and whose will not. It's offensive to me as someone who loves the Constitution."" ""The whole thing is shrouded in secrecy,"" he added. The chaplain said he has filed an appeal and that it is still pending along with many others. ""Nobody knows quite what to do with us while we're waiting for all of these appeals to be adjudicated,"" he said. ""I am in limbo. I'm waiting to hear back on the appeal. Meanwhile, we're all sort of second-class citizens because we haven't had the jab."" He said he believes service members are being used as ""test subjects"" with a  vaccine  that’s is still being studied. ""I honestly think that the push for 100% vaccination has to do with eliminating anything that looks like a control group,"" he said. ""I think that there's probably money involved somewhere. I think that the military has been a nice little test group, a set of test subjects that really can't say no."" The CDC has repeatedly said that the vaccines are safe for use, and studies have shown that unvaccinated COVID patients are  far more likely to die  from the virus than vaccinated patients.

The lawmakers highlighted quotes from emails and letters exchanged by the seven scientists in late January and early February 2020 that suggest they suspected the coronavirus to have been manufactured rather than naturally occurring.  ""The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered,"" Dr. Kristian Andersen wrote in a Jan. 31, 2020, email to Fauci and Dr. Jeremy Farrar. Andersen reportedly said that Drs. Eddie Holmes, Bob Garry, Mike Farzan ""and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory."" Farrar, Holmes, Garry, Frazan and Andersen were among the seven doctors to receive a letter from the lawmakers Thursday. All the doctors who received letters either took part in a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call with Fauci and Collins or communicated with those who had.

In the correspondence referenced by the congressmen,  the letters note  that on Feb. 4, 2020 ,  Holmes reportedly said he was ""60-40"" in favor of the lab theory while Farrar said he was ""50-50."" INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FAILED TO FIND CONCLUSIVE COVID ORIGIN; EXPERTS SPLIT ON WHY ""It is unclear whether Dr. Collins or Dr. Fauci ever relayed these serious concerns to policymakers through the proper chains of command,"" the lawmakers added. But the lawmakers have taken issue with a report that appeared in  Nature Medicine  titled, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2."" The report was written by Andersen, Holmes and Garry, as well as Drs. W. Ian Lipkin and Andrew Rambaut – who also received letters Thursday. The report noted their ""analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" But lawmakers want to know why the opinions of the doctors seemingly changed from their previous statements in early 2020. The report was published on March 17, 2020, though the lawmakers in their letter allege it was written on Feb. 4, 2020.

   At the end of last month,  President Biden  proclaimed February  American Heart Month , inviting all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on Feb. 4.  Friday honors those the country has lost to  heart disease  and aims to raise awareness of the actions people can take to prevent it.  In a Jan. 31 proclamation,  the president wrote that he had asked Congress  to launch the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) initiative, investing billions of dollars in preventing, detecting and treating  cancer , cardiovascular conditions and other diseases. MEN WHO TEND TO WORRY HAVE INCREASED RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE, STROKE: STUDY ""My administration is also working across federal agencies to develop new programs to alleviate heart health disparities, including those that threaten  maternal health ,"" he noted.  ""Continuing the fight against cardiovascular disease is crucial to improving our nation’s public health. During American Heart Month, we must recommit ourselves to ensuring a healthier future for all Americans,"" Biden stated.  As the president said, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports  about 659,000 people die from heart disease every year.

The  American Heart Association (AHA) says  that CVDs accounted for 874,613 deaths in the U.S. in 2019 and coronary heart disease accounted for 360,900 deaths in 2018.  The organization also said stroke accounted for approximately one of every 19 deaths in the U.S. in 2019.   Video ""Despite the significant progress we have made, heart disease continues to exact a heartbreaking toll – a burden disproportionately carried by Black and Brown Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and people who live in rural communities. Cardiovascular diseases – including heart conditions and strokes – are also a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths, which are highest among women of color. Addressing these tragic disparities and improving heart health has never been more important, as people suffering from heart disease and related conditions are also at increased risk of severe illness and long-term effects from  COVID-19 ,"" the president pointed out.  The CDC reports that heart disease is also the leading cause of death for people of most racial and ethnic groups in the country, including African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and White men.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By  living a healthy lifestyle  and monitoring medical conditions, people can lower the risk for heart disease.  Physical activity, a healthy diet, less stress, avoiding smoking and vaping and getting good sleep can reduce the risk of heart disease.

   WASHINGTON, D.C. -  Republican Gov.  Doug Ducey , Ariz., was among those who defended his decision to keep kids in the  classroom  during the most recent variant of the  COVID-19  pandemic despite heavy media criticism at the 2022 National Governors Association (NGA) meeting. Arizona Central published an opinion piece in January suggesting Ducey had done serious harm to children by keeping  schools  open as omicron, a highly contagious yet reportedly less severe variant of the virus, swept the country. ""Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey won't even try to save kids from COVID-19,"" the headline for writer EJ Montini's piece read, with the subhead, ""The rapid spread of the omicron variant, combined with the holidays, the cold weather and the re-opening of schools could be a disaster in the making."" Montini argued that Ducey whiffed repeatedly on the chance to slow the spread, arguing he could have required proof of vaccination or of a COVID-free test before children or teachers are admitted back into the classroom, or impose a statewide indoor mask mandate. The author suggested Ducey should take a page out of Washington, D.C.'s strict vaccine orders, where Mayor Muriel Bowser recently enforced a city wide  vaccine  mandate.

Today unions back politicians stand in the schoolhouse door and won't let minorities out,"" Ducey told Fox News Digital. ""They are trapped in failing schools. That’s what the media should be reporting on. But they want to report on masks, and not talk about math scores.""  Oklahoma Gov.

""What should be taught in schools. Is it a federal policy, or should it belong to the states?"" Stitt asked, saying in his opinion it belongs to the latter.  ""We are listening to the public health officials,"" he continued. ""From the CDC on down, to the President of the United States, are saying that kids should be in a classroom, they should be inside schools. So of course the media seems to feel differently, of course the teachers unions feel differently. But in Arizona our schools are open, and they’re going to remain open.""

   U.S. Air Force  veteran   Chad Carswell , 38, of Conover,  North Carolina,  is in desperate need of a kidney  transplant  to save his life. But he does not believe that getting a  COVID-19  vaccine is the best thing for him, and as a result — because he won't take the vaccine, which is required for transplant candidates by hospitals in his area — he's been denied a life-saving kidney transplant. ""I've had COVID-19 twice,"" he told Fox News Digital in a phone interview on Thursday, Feb. 3, 2022.  That, however, does not seem to be taken into account, he said, by the medical powers that be regarding transplant procedures. ""I'm blessed,"" emphasized Carswell. ""I'm still here — so as long as I'm here, I still have a chance.""     
      Veteran Chad Carswell is shown receiving dialysis, which he takes three times a week. He spoke to Fox News Digital on Feb. 3, 2022, and said, ""I'm blessed."" He's going to keep fighting for his health and for upholding the freedom of choice in his life and for everyone, he said.
       (Courtesy Chad Carswell) Carswell, the oldest of four in his family, said his parents as well as his family and friends understand his position and support his point of view. ""Dialysis days for me are Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Those are hard. They're long days for me. Very draining and very hard on my body. But I'm pushing through them."" Dialysis, however, will only preserve his life for a certain amount of time. A double amputee, Carswell has had previous heart surgeries. He's also had six heart attacks (yes,  six) .  Earlier in his life, he weighed over 400 pounds, he told Fox News Digital. He also suffered from Type 2  diabetes  (which is how he lost his legs). But he's been working out regularly and today is 230 pounds.  MIKE POMPEO SHARES HIS WEIGHT-LOSS UPDATE His diabetes is under control through a careful diet and plenty of exercise, Carswell said; he's taken no medications for that. His kidneys, though, are operating at 4% effectiveness — and he's been told he will die without a transplant.     
      Chad Carswell served in the U.S. Air Force from 2001-2005. This photo, which he shared with Fox News Digital, was taken in '01. Carswell was in boot camp when 9/11 occurred and served in Operation Enduring Freedom. 
       (Chad Carswell ) Carswell said, ""I am not anti-vax. This isn't political. I'm all about choice. And I believe that anybody who chooses to get the vaccine because they think that it's safe for them and it's what's best for them and their family, plus the boosters — by all means, do whatever you need to do. You're not wrong."" ""But me choosing to do the same thing for me [meaning to have his freedom of choice] is the exact same thing as you choosing to do what you feel is right for you. I'm not wrong, either. I have my own opinions."" ""I'm a veteran. I fought for this country. And I believe in my right to be able to choose what I think is right for me.""   — Chad Carswell to Fox News Digital He added, ""Do I believe in the vaccine? No, I don't. Do I believe that it works? I don't. And I also believe that natural immunities are very, very key to COVID."" ""I've had COVID twice,"" he emphasized. ""I have natural immunities for it. For me, it is about the choice of things that are right for me.""   Carswell said he's gotten a lot of support from people far and wide for his positions. But he's also gotten a lot of negativity, he said, from those who question why he would want a transplant when he remains unvaxxed.

And if we don't stand up now, and stop our freedoms and our rights from being taken away from us, then what kind of world are we living in years from now?"" Fox News Digital asked Carswell about his family and how worried they must be about him, given his situation.  ""I'm very, very close to my dad and my mother,"" he answered. ""My dad is 100% my best friend. And my dad is the reason I'm still here today. I almost died [earlier in his life]. Yet I made it through everything because of my dad.""

He noted that at 38 years old, he is ""going to stand by his decision and live my life"" as best he can, he said.  ""I've been sharing my story for the last five years, very openly, even before COVID,"" Carswell said, referring to his personal battle for better health. ""My entire family has been there every step of the way.""      
      Chad Carswell of North Carolina works out regularly when he's not taking dialysis. ""I've had people try to make this political,"" he said. For him, it is not, however. He believes in freedom of personal choice. 
       (Chad Carswell ) He also said that he will keep his dialysis going for as long as he can. ""But for me, it's either I get a kidney transplant, or I die,"" he said. ""Nobody wants to lose me — nobody wants me to die,"" he added.  Carswell also said, ""I'm a firm believer in God and in Jesus Christ. My  faith  has a lot to do with how I've been able to stand up against [the negative people] out there,"" he said.  ""I get hundreds of [negative] messages a day,"" he also said, referencing social media commentary.

US hospitals facing nurse shortages seek foreign health care workers amid visa windfall,Associated Press," February 3, 2022 5:42pm EST","  close     Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for February 3   Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

   With American hospitals facing a dire shortage of nurses amid a slogging pandemic, many are looking abroad for  health care workers . And it could be just in time. There's an unusually high number of green cards available this year for foreign professionals, including nurses, who want to move to the United States — twice as many as just a few years ago. That's because U.S. consulates shut down during the coronavirus pandemic weren't issuing visas to relatives of American citizens, and, by law, these unused slots now get transferred to eligible workers. Amy L. Erlbacher-Anderson, an immigration attorney in  Omaha, Nebraska , said she has seen more demand for foreign nurses in two years than the rest of her 18-year career. And this year, she said, it's more likely they'll get approved to come, so long as U.S. consular offices can process all the applications. ""We have double the number of visas we've had available for decades,"" she said. ""That is kind of temporarily creating a very open situation."" U.S. hospitals are struggling with a shortage of nurses that worsened as  pandemic burnout  led many to retire or leave their jobs. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases continue to rise and fall, placing tremendous pressure on the health care system. In California alone, there's an estimated gap of 40,000 nurses, or 14% of the workforce, according to a recent report by the  University of California , San Francisco. Hospitals are filling the gap by hiring traveling nurses, but that can be expensive. And hospital administrators say not enough nurses are graduating from U.S. schools each year to meet the demand. Some hospitals have long brought nurses from the Philippines,  Jamaica  and other English-speaking countries, and more are now following suit. And both longtime recruiters and newcomers are trying to take advantage of the green card windfall before the fiscal year ends in September. The U.S. typically offers at least 140,000 green cards each year to people moving to the country permanently for certain professional jobs, including nursing. Most are issued to people who are already living in the United States on temporary visas, though some go to workers overseas. This year, 280,000 of these green cards are available, and recruiters hope some of the extras can be snapped up by nurses seeking to work in pandemic-weary hospitals in the United States. The  Biden administration , which has made moves to reverse  Trump-era  policies restricting  legal immigration , has taken some steps to try to help foreign health care workers so they can assist with the pandemic. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would speed the renewal of work permits for health care workers, which could help keep some foreign citizens already in the United States on the job. The State Department told consulates last year to prioritize applications for workers at facilities that are responding to the pandemic, an agency official said.

After completing college in the U.S., Akinmade has been working as an ICU nurse for University of Louisville Hospital  in Kentucky . But her work permit is set to expire in March. She said she needs it renewed, or her green card approved, to stay on the job. ""At this point and time, I just feel like I have faith that at the end of March something is going to show up to continue to work,"" Akinmade said. She said the issue affects many of her international colleagues as well as domestic ones, who may be pressed to take on shifts for colleagues if their immigration paperwork doesn’t come through. Dr. Roxie Wells, president of Cape Fear Valley Hoke Hospital in  Raeford, North Carolina , said she started trying to bring over foreign nurses before the pandemic, but it wasn't until last year that these recruits started getting consular interviews in larger numbers. So far, about 150 were approved to come work, but Wells said they're still waiting on another 75. ""Obviously it has become more necessary during the pandemic,"" she said. ""The 150, if we didn’t have them, we would be in a precarious situation."" The surge in the omicron variant in the United States has made the strained staffing situation even more apparent in  hospitals  as health care workers, like so many others, have been sickened by the highly contagious virus and sidelined from work at a time when more patients are coming in. Sinead Carbery, president of Nurse Staffing Solutions for AMN Healthcare, said the demand for international nurses has risen between 300% and 400% since the pandemic began. The number of nurses that can be brought into the United States even with the additional green cards won't be enough to meet demand, and many more recruiters are now seeking to hire nurses overseas because there are immigrant visas available, she said. ""This is a window of opportunity,"" she said. ""Because everything is flowing so well, there's a lot of competition for that talent."" HOSPITALS ACROSS THE US TURNING TO FOREIGN NURSES AS HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE FIRED OVER VACCINE MANDATES National Nurses United, a union representing 175,000 registered nurses, said more scrutiny should be given to international recruitment to ensure foreign nurses aren't brought in and subjected to unsafe working conditions. The union contends hospitals drove away U.S. nurses by keeping staffing levels so low — and this was well before concerns arose about worker safety and protections during the COVID-19 pandemic. Michelle Mahon, the union's assistant director of nursing practice, said many foreign nurses sign yearslong contracts with employers, which can make it hard for them to speak up about labor or patient safety concerns. She said hospitals that saw nurses quit during the pandemic are turning to an overseas workforce to replace them. ""This kind of dynamic is particularly attractive right now to employers who have not made any of the changes necessary to ensure patient and nursing safety during this COVID-19 pandemic,"" Mahon said. ""Instead of them addressing the actual problem, they want to go and pivot to this other really fake solution."" Hospital administrators, however, contend there simply aren’t enough U.S.-trained nurses to go around. Patty Jeffrey, president of the American Association of International Healthcare Recruitment, said the United States should expand nursing education programs to train more nurses domestically, as well as let more nurses come in from overseas. But she acknowledged bringing in a much larger number of nurses would require legislation. ""The calls are every day ringing off the hook: We need 100, we need 200, we need all these nurses,"" Jeffrey said. Jorge Almeida Neri, a 26-year-old nurse  from Portugal , arrived in the United States late last year, though he began the process before the pandemic. He said a required international nursing exam was delayed due to the virus and it took four months to get a consular interview, though other international nurses he's met waited much longer. He interviewed for his current job at a Virginia hospital, which he got through a staffing agency, about a year ago. ""After getting everything certified, the immigration process started, and I was like, ‘Oh, this is going to be quick.’ I was wrong,"" he said. Almeida Neri said many Portuguese nurses seek work overseas since wages are low, though many go elsewhere in Europe, which doesn't take as long as the United States. Despite the demand, there's no guarantee hospitals will in fact snap up more visas. Greg Siskind, an immigration attorney, said U.S. consular offices aren't required to issue visas solely because they're available, and are hampered by limits on remote work and video interviews. He said most employment-based green cards tend to go to professionals already in the United States, not overseas, though more could be done to speed these up, too. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS ""Under their current policies, if they don't make any changes, it is going to be hard,"" he said of the likelihood the U.S. government will issue all the available visas, ""but there's a lot of things they could do.""

""In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.""

"Tucker Carlson: Mask mandates are a debate about power, not about science",Tucker Carlson," February 3, 2022 10:57pm EST","  close     Video   Tucker: Are the voters or unelected bureaucrats running this country?   ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host argues leaders are using mask mandates to ‘manipulate’ people for power. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   You may remember that Glenn Youngkin became governor of  Virginia  last month. Youngkin was elected in part because he promised to let parents decide whether or not their kids wear masks in school. Voters wanted that. So true to his word, almost immediately after he was sworn in, Youngkin banned mask mandates in school. No one was surprised by this, obviously. Again, he ran on it. That's how democracy is supposed to work. Voters want something, they asked for it, then they elect someone to do it, and then that person does it.  So in Virginia, our system functioned perfectly, our democratic system. But there are still people in the state of Virginia who don't believe in democracy, and they're not QAnon people, by the way, they're members of the  Democratic Party . They have no interest in what voters think, they have contempt for election results. They do what they want. And it turns out a lot of these people are now running the public  schools  in Virginia. And, because they don't care about the law or election outcomes, they've refused to lift the mask mandates for children. So Gov. Youngkin pushed back against this, of course, and the standoff wound up in court.  Yesterday, the judge in that case, Louise diMatteo, made a highly revealing statement: ""I'm not going to decide who's right and who's wrong on masking,"" she said. ""This is really about the hierarchy of authority."" Well, exactly. That really is what it's about. After more than two years of  COVID  restrictions, there's not a huge amount of scientific debate over masks on children. Masks don't appear to work. They don't appear to protect children. We do know they hurt children profoundly.  VA CIRCUIT JUDGE ON SCHOOLS MASK MANDATE: ‘IT’S ABOUT THE HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY'  So at this point, the only debate left, as the judge pointed out, is not to debate over science. It's a debate about power. And here are the parameters: Who's in charge of your children? Is it you, the parent, or is it the teachers' unions? Who runs your country? Is it you, the voters, or is it unelected bureaucrats? Are they really in charge? So, to be clear, this isn't really about masks. Those are the questions we're debating at this point.

       Janet Davidson has already made up her mind about these questions. Davidson is an assistant principal at an elementary school in Loudoun County, Virginia. Here, she threatens to have children arrested if they dare to show up to class without a mask. DAVIDSON:   Until you arrive your children will be held in an in-school restriction situation here at school. It is important that I point out to you it is stated in the letter that you'll receive -- but, it's important that I point out to you that they are not allowed on campus or on Loudoun County Public School property. Starting tomorrow, it will be considered trespassing. So it's important that I make that statement to you. But we'll look forward to hearing from you via phone so you can let us know so you can let us know when you'll be able to pick them up. So you have to ask, how could someone like that wind up running an elementary school? Wouldn't that be the last person you'd want to hand your kids over to every morning? Well, sure. And to be clear, trespassing, the crime that she cites, is in Virginia Class 1 misdemeanor. If you trespass, you can get a year in prison and a $2,500 fine. And that's exactly what she is threatening kids with if they show up without masks at school. So in Loudoun County, you can sexually assault someone in a bathroom, the school will cover for you. But if you show up without a mask, you face a year in jail.    Video And it's not just Virginia, by the way, this is happening all over the country, according to a service that tracks mask policies and school districts across America. More than 60% of the 500 districts it monitors still require masks.  VIRGINIA FACES NEW LEGAL BATTLES OVER MASKING IN SCHOOLS In West Islip,  New York , for example, the Oquenock Elementary School sent letters to parents recently explaining their children will be considered truant if they dare to show up to school without a mask. Now in the state of New York, the parents of truant students can receive fines and prison terms. This show obtained a letter from Oquenock, the elementary school, to the parents of a very young child enrolled there. ""For the last week, your child has arrived at school but refused to wear a mask, and therefore has not been permitted to attend class or participate in other school activities,"" reads the letter. ""Your child will no longer be able to attend school unless they wear a mask...If your child does not return to school, they will be considered truant.""  Oh, so the child is punished either way. What you notice is that nowhere in the letter is there any  scientific  justification for these rules because, of course, there isn't one, it doesn't exist. There is a consensus now among serious people that mask mandates for children do not protect children or adults. And to be clear, that's not a right-wing opinion. The Atlantic Magazine, whose default setting for two full years has been screaming COVID hysteria, just published a piece entitled ""The Case Against Masks at School."" The piece notes mask ""provide little discernible benefit,"" and it's not just the Atlantic. Today, a team of scientists and virologists published an op-ed in USA Today. Their conclusion? ""With vaccines available mask mandates are not necessary in school,"" period. They went on to explain, ""even in unvaccinated children, rates of serious disease from COVID-19 are similar to that of the seasonal flu, and we do not normally take exceptional precautions in schools for the flu, for which we do not normally implement school mask mandates.""  NY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SPENT HOURS OUT IN THE COLD AFTER SHE REFUSED TO WEAR A MASK You knew that, but they're finally admitting it. Now they reviewed the data on school and masking and ""find that well-controlled real-world studies consistently failed to find a convincing benefit, while studies cited to support masking have serious flaws."" Once again, we've been telling you this for a year and a half. And now it's completely confirmed. There doesn't seem to be a debate about it.  Masks don't benefit children. They actively harm children. Child development experts are weighing in and saying, oh yes, long-term use of masks on children can inflict profound cognitive damage. Again, you could have guessed this. Now it's confirmed. One therapist, for example, in Palm Beach, Florida, says her clinic has seen a 364% increase in referrals of babies and toddlers. Why? Masks.  Everything about this is shocking. But what's most shocking of all is that we are virtually alone in doing this. In other countries in the civilized world, the UK, Norway, many others, kids are not required to wear masks in school because they don't work, and they hurt kids. This is not a mystery. It's not a secret. School officials know this, there's no logic or data to support their position. So when you don't have evidence or a legitimate justification, you move very quickly to indoctrination. You lie because you have no choice. Here's an assistant superintendent for Wake County Public Schools, that would be in North Carolina, areep called Paul Koh. He explains on video his plan to reprogram children so they obey him without question.      
      Coronavirus prevention face mask protection N95 masks and medical surgical masks at home .
       (iStock) KOH:  It's like if you're a two-year-old, you're trying to help them practice for age three and then four when they're going into pre-K classrooms. And then from there, you're trying to help them get into a normalized situation wearing masks, potentially, in a kindergarten classroom and so forth. So that's what we're trying to do. Okay, so there's no reason to have a country in which our children are, ""educated by people like that,"" in which you're required by law to hand your kids over to people like that. People who are clearly psychologically damaged, who have agendas that have nothing to do with education, and are, in fact, sinister. Why are they doing this? Well, of course, because long term, this is how you maintain power. If you've got nothing to convince people with, you manipulate them. You weaken the young people, you degrade their mental health. That's how you maintain control. Take a look at these pictures from Oxford Middle School in the state of  Connecticut . You can see students in a band playing instruments with masks over their faces. But even more ridiculous, the instruments themselves have masks. Now, it's easy to laugh at this, but it's also horrifying. Think about the brainwashing required to do this with a straight face.    Video By the way, the lunacy extends to adults. In Broward County,  Florida , a free state most of the time, anyone who wants to check out a book from the library must have a mask on. So, comply or you're not allowed to read. Now, some people have medical exemptions where they don't have to wear a mask, they have COPD, for example. If you have a medical exemption, you don't get to read as many books. You have to make do with a much smaller selection of reading material.  LIBRARY GUEST: Do we have any idea when they're going to start honoring these exemptions because this is ridiculous? LIBRARY WORKER: We don't know anything about that, we just follow what they tell us to do and I do apologize.  Yeah, let's put kids on Zoom class for two years and prevent adults from reading books unless they obey. Pretty hard to justify any of this in terms a logical person would understand. So they're not even bothering, the people enforcing these rules aren't arguing on their behalf. They're just laughing at you and making you do it. Here's an example from Los Angeles; the mayor of that city, the second-biggest city in this country,  Eric Garcetti , explains that he wasn't wearing a mask when he took an indoor photograph with Magic Johnson, someone who's technically immunocompromised, but whatever. Here's his his explanation. LA'S GARCETTI MOCKED FOR RESPONSE TO MASKLESS PICTURE GARCETTI: When people ask for a photograph, I hold my breath … There's a zero percent chance of infection from that … I won't pull it down for two seconds anymore, that's easy. But to me, it is crystal clear that nobody has been endangered by that.  I held my breath. I did not inhale. Notice he doesn't blush when he says that, he just says it and expects you to believe it. That's a totally adequate explanation. Can I get away with it? I didn't breathe. Therefore, it's fine. Try that on a commercial airline flight.  Gavin Newsom  did the same. He also took a maskless photograph with Magic Johnson. By the way, for the record, that's fine. But these are the people who are telling you it's a crime. So when they're caught doing it, what's their excuse? Well, in the case of the governor of California, he says he had the mask in his hand, so he was safe. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP NEWSOM: You're correct, I was very judicious yesterday, very judicious, and you'll see the photo that I did take where Magic was kind enough, generous enough, to ask me for a photograph. And in my left hand is the mask and I took a photo. The rest of the time I wore it, as we all should, not when I had a glass of water or anything and encourage everybody else to do so. And that's it.  Not actually encouraging everyone else to do this. More like requiring everyone else to do so. That and a whole lot of other things that have no scientific justification. But as long as you have a mask in your left hand, and you happen to be the governor of California and you make the rules, you don't have to obey the rules. That's how it works. So again, these explanations are getting more transparent, more absurd. And that should make you a little worried because when people stop explaining things, or trying to justify them, or try to win you over their position, what do they have left to make you comply? Force. That's it. They just have force.  This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the February 3, 2022, edition of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""  "

   A 16-year-old  high school  student sat in a cold vestibule for hours because her  New York  high school wouldn't allow her in the building without a mask, even though the state's mask mandate had been struck down as unconstitutional the day before. While the police department said the girl remained in the school's vestibule for a kind of sit-in protest, the girl's father claimed the school mistreated her by refusing to give her food, water, or access to a bathroom. ""She was getting treated definitely worse than a prisoner,"" Vincent Igoe, the girl's father, told Fox News Digital on Sunday. ""Even inmates in jail get offered food and water."" NEW YORK JUDGE STRIKES DOWN HOCHUL'S MASK MANDATE, GOVERNOR VOWS FIGHT Igoe shared footage with Fox News of his encounters with his daughter, the school resource officer, his ex-wife, and an associate principal at South Colonie Central High School outside Albany, New York, on Tuesday, Jan. 25. He claimed that the videos showed that the school exiled his daughter from class unlawfully.      
      
       (Vincent Igoe) The South Colonie Central School District superintendent disputed Igoe's version of events but declined to explain why he considered the father's claims ""false and misleading."" The Colonie Police Department said that the girl's presence in the vestibule was a kind of protest, that the school had merely followed its policy, and that the school resource officer did nothing wrong. Igoe recounted that on Monday, Jan. 24, he and his daughter were watching the news, and they heard that a New York Supreme Court judge  struck down  the state's mask mandate as ""unconstitutional."" ""She said, ‘I’m not wearing my mask tomorrow,'"" Igoe recalled. Even though an appeals court judge  temporarily reinstated  the mandate on Tuesday afternoon, Igoe's daughter's actions took place while the mandate was no longer in effect. Indeed, Igoe gave Fox News Digital an email that Superintendent David Perry had sent to school officials, urging them to uphold the mandate despite the court ruling.     
      Email from South Colonie Central School District Superintendent David Perry
       ""Please see attached court document regarding NYS Supreme Court Justice Thomas Rademaker's ruling today, January 24, 2022, that the Governor's mask mandate for students is illegal,"" Perry wrote. ""This will undoubtedly get appealed as there are several court levels higher than this judge. We will stay the course with mask usage in South Colonie until further notice."" PARENTS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SLAM ACLU FOR OPPOSING CURRICULUM TRANSPARENCY LAWS AMID CRT BATTLES Igoe recounted the events of Tuesday, Jan. 25. ""She was stopped in the hallway, and then she was dragged,"" he recounted. ""The administrators told her to put a mask on, she said she’s not putting a mask on, it’s illegal. Then a school resource officer grabbed her by her arm, and dragged her through the hallway into the cold vestibule of the school.""     
      
       (Vincent Igoe) Igoe said he arrived at the school around 7:50 a.m. He confronted the school resource officer and an associate principal. ""If you’re not going to let her in school, I said please provide me suspension documents or something in writing saying why you are not letting her in school,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""All I’m asking for is this document, something in writing saying why they want her to leave."" ""I stayed in that vestibule with my daughter until the police department threatened to arrest me,"" he said. He left and returned hours later. ""They kept her in that vestibule all day long, with no food, no water, and no bathroom,"" he said.  Igoe said the school initially refused to let his daughter use the restroom, but later relented. ""They walked her outside in 15-degree weather, no jacket,"" to use the bathroom ""in an unused part of the school, unused and unheated part of the school."" The father also claimed that the school resource officer used force against his daughter, yet none of his footage shows the officer dragging his daughter by the arm. Bob Winn , deputy chief at the Colonie Police Department, disputed parts of Igoe's account and defended the school resource officer's actions. ""The officer was trying to assist the mother of the child with getting her out of the school,"" Winn told Fox News Digital on Sunday. He said that footage from inside the school exonerated the officer from Igoe's claims. ""He placed his hand on the backpack of the child, the mother was pulling the child by the arm."" Winn admitted that the officer later grabbed the girl's sweatshirt by the arm. LOS ANGELES CHARTER STUDENTS SUE TO STOP VACCINE MANDATE, CLAIM SCHOOL ‘SEGREGATED’ THEM ‘BEHIND BARRIERS’ Winn said the officer tried to ""mitigate the situation"" with the girl. ""The daughter wanted to stay as a sort of sit-in protest in the vestibule,"" Winn explained, calling her time in the vestibule an ""agreed-upon decision"" between the girl and the school. ""They had no responsibility to check on her,"" although ""one of the school officials did walk her to another part of the school to use the restroom."" Winn did not address the legality of the mask mandate, but he noted that ""the schools still had a policy in effect which they were applying,"" and the officer assisted in that situation.

   The country where the coronavirus outbreak emerged two years ago launched a locked-down Winter  Olympics  on Friday, proudly projecting its might on the most global of stages even as some Western governments mounted a diplomatic boycott over the way China treats millions of its own people. Beijing becomes the first city to host both winter and summer Olympic Games. And while some are staying away from the second pandemic Olympics in six months, many other world leaders planned to attend the opening ceremony. Most notable: Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met privately with China’s Xi Jinping earlier in the day as a dangerous standoff unfolds at Russia’s border with Ukraine. The Olympics — and the opening ceremony — are always an exercise in performance for the host nation, a chance to showcase its culture, define its place in the world, flaunt its best side. That's something China in particular has been consumed with for decades. But at this year's Beijing Games, the gulf between performance and reality will be particularly jarring.       LIVE UPDATES: BEIJING OLYMPICS     
      People wait for the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Friday, Feb. 4, 2022, in Beijing.
       (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) Fourteen years ago, a Beijing opening ceremony that featured massive pyrotechnic displays and thousands of card-flipping performers set a new standard of extravagance to start an Olympics that no host since has matched. It was a fitting start to an event often billed as China's ""coming out."" Now, no matter how you view it, China has arrived — and the opening ceremony returns to the same now-familiar, lattice-encased National Stadium known as the Bird’s Nest, built in consultation with Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei. But the hope for a more open China that accompanied those first Games has faded. For Beijing, these Olympics are a confirmation of its status as world player and power. But for many outside China, particularly in the West, they have become a confirmation of the country’s increasingly authoritarian turn. Chinese authorities are crushing pro-democracy activism, tightening their control over Hong Kong, becoming more confrontational with Taiwan and interning Muslim Uyghurs in the far west — a crackdown the U.S. government and others have called genocide. The pandemic also weighs heavily on this year's Games, just as it did last summer in Tokyo. More than two years after the first COVID-19 cases were identified in China’s Hubei province, nearly 6 million human beings have died and hundreds of millions more around the world have been sickened. The host country itself claims some of the lowest rates of death and illness from the virus, in part because of sweeping lockdowns imposed by the government that were instantly apparent to anyone arriving to compete in or attend the Winter Games. In the lead-up to the Olympics, China’s suppression of dissent was also on display in the controversy surrounding Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai. She disappeared from public view last year after accusing a former Communist Party official of sexual assault. Her accusation was quickly scrubbed from the internet, and discussion of it remains heavily censored. Concerned for her safety, tennis greats and others outside China demanded on social media to know, ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" A surreal cat-and-mouse game has since unfolded, with Peng making a brief appearance at a youth tennis event and speaking by video link with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach as part of efforts to allay concerns about her. While the political issues have overshadowed the run-up, as with any Olympics, attention will shift Saturday — at least partially — from the geopolitical issues of the day to the athletes themselves. All eyes turn now to whether Alpine skiing superstar Mikaela Shiffrin, who already owns three Olympic medals, can exceed sky-high expectations. How snowboard sensation Shaun White will cap off his Olympic career — and if the sport’s current standard-bearer, Chloe Kim, will wow us again. And whether Russia’s women will sweep the medals in figure skating. And China is pinning its hopes on Eileen Gu, the 18-year-old, American-born freestyle skier who has chosen to compete for her mother’s native country and could win three gold medals. As they compete, the conditions imposed by Chinese authorities offer a stark contrast to the party atmosphere of the 2008 Games. Some flight attendants, immigration officials and hotel staff have been covered head-to-toe in hazmat gear, masks and goggles. There is a daily testing regimen for all attendees, followed by lengthy quarantines for all those testing positive. Even so, there is no passing from the Olympic venues through the ever-present cordons of chain-link fence — covered in cheery messages of a ""shared future together"" — into the city itself, another point of divergence with the 2008 Games. China itself has also transformed in the years since. Then, it was an emerging global economic force making its biggest leap yet onto the global stage by hosting those Games. Now it is a fully realized superpower hosting these. Xi, who was the head of the 2008 Olympics, now runs the entire country and has encouraged a personality-driven campaign of adulation. Gone are the hopeful statements from organizers and Western governments that hosting the Olympics would pressure the ruling Communist Party to clean up what they called its problematic human rights record and to become a more responsible international citizen. Today, three decades after its troops crushed massive democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of Chinese, the government has locked up more than 1 million members of minority groups, mostly Muslim Uyghurs from its far-western Xinjiang region, in mass internment camps. The situation has led human rights groups to dub these the ""Genocide Games."" China says the camps are ""vocational training and education centers"" that are part of an anti-terror campaign. It denies any human rights violations and says it has restored stability to Xinjiang, a region it insisted in the months after the 9/11 attacks was rife with extremism, often with little evidence. Such behavior was what led leaders of the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada, among others, to impose a diplomatic boycott on these Games, shunning appearances alongside Chinese leadership while allowing their athletes to compete. Outside the Olympic ""bubble"" that separates regular Beijingers from Olympians and their entourages, some expressed enthusiasm and pride at the world coming to their doorstep. Zhang Wenquan, a collector of Olympic memorabilia, showed off his wares Friday while standing next to a 2008 mascot. He was excited, but the excitement was tempered by the virus that has changed so much for so many. ""I think the effect of the fireworks is going to be much better than it in 2008,"" he said. ""I really look forward to the opening ceremony. I actually wanted to go to the venue to watch it. I have been trying so hard to watch it at the scene. But because of the epidemic, there may be no chance.""  "

MSNBC lambasted after guest claims unvaccinated children likely to get 'serious' COVID: 'Fearmongering',Brandon Gillespie," February 4, 2022 9:40am EST","  close     Video   Media top headlines February 4   In media news today, an AP reporter spars with the State Department’s Ned Price over allegations on Russia, a report claims that Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust gave Andrew Cuomo COVID ‘talking points’ to combat Trump, and an MSNBC broadcast gets interrupted by a ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ flag. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   MSNBC was lambasted by critics Thursday for spreading misinformation about the omicron variant of the  coronavirus,  following a guest's claim that unvaccinated young children were ""likely"" to get a ""serious"" case of the virus. During a Wednesday appearance on ""Andrea Mitchell Reports,"" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Biden adviser on COVID-19 policy, discussed the potential for a coronavirus vaccine being approved for children under the age of five and implored parents to get their children  vaccinated  once it was available. He claimed otherwise they were ""likely"" to get a ""serious"" case of omicron. Data, however, suggests that it's highly unlikely children would contract a serious case of the virus. According to Reuters, one study showed that children were actually getting less sick from omicron than other variants. Children have also been far less likely to get severely ill from COVID-19 throughout the pandemic than older age groups. OMICRON CAUSES LESS SEVERE INFECTIONS THAN DELTA AND OTHER VARIANTS, ACCORDING TO CDC STUDY ""This repeats what we’ve seen in older kids, five and above, where we know the vaccine does protect very well. And there we still have under 50%, I believe, of the children vaccinated, and that’s a serious problem for the country,"" Emanuel told host Kristen Welker after she asked about the willingness of parents to get their kids vaccinated. ""Parents have to be more willing – I think they hear some of these rare side effects and think they’re very common."" ""With the omicron variant, kids are either going to get the vaccine or they’re likely to get a serious condition of omicron. Having omicron with the vaccine is almost invariably going to be better and safer for children,"" he added. ""I am confused about parents' attitudes. Five and above seems like a no-brainer. Two to five, I understand some hesitancy. Two and under with the small dose, I think probably a very good idea."" Another  recent study  cited by economist Emily Oster also reiterated the extremely low risk young children face of severe COVID-19 outcomes. ""What we can say is that based on everything we know, the risks to small children from COVID-19 are extremely small,"" she wrote. OMICRON SLOWING IN THESE STATES, OFFICIALS SAY Critics took to social media to blast MSNBC and Emanuel, with some calling his claim about the possibility of a serious case of omicron ""remotely untrue,"" and others referring to it as ""dangerous misinformation.""

The murky world of gain-of-function research,Benjamin Hall," February 3, 2022 10:07pm EST","  close     Video   Scientists claims concerns about Wuhan lab leak were silenced   Stanford School of Medicine's Dr. Jay Bhattacharya speaks out against COVID lockdowns and the theory that COVID came from nature. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Gain-of-function research conducted at the  Wuhan  Institute of Virology has widely been suspected as a source of the pandemic. ""What they were doing at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was taking dangerous, scary viruses and making them scarier,"" Jamie Metzl of the Atlantic Council told Fox News. In basic terms, the point of gain-of-function research is to make a  virus  more dangerous. Scientists argue that, with this research, they can be prepared to handle it if one day the virus were to mutate naturally. However, critics argue that if viruses evolve in that way, it might take thousands of years, or it might never happen at all. Scientists are often doing gain-of-function research for months for no practical purpose, such as using it to build their own resumes.     
      Dr. Shi Zhengli, known as the Wuhan Institute 'Bat Lady' reportedly worked with military officials at the lab, despite denying it.  (APTN)
       But whatever the motive is, today the research continues around the world, with little oversight, and often funded by taxpayers.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), which approves funding for these projects, said, ""While such research is inherently risk, the risk of not doing this type of research and not being prepared for the next pandemic is also high."" HHS, NIH UNDER FIRE FROM HOUSE GOP SEEKING ANSWERS ON WUHAN'S COVID ORIGINS There have been repeated allegations and denials that such research, funded by the NIH, was going on in Wuhan, China.  Dr Anthony Fauci  was adamant in an outburst with U.S. Senator  Rand Paul , R-Ky., back in 2021. ""You are entirely, entirely and completely incorrect that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute,"" Dr. Fauci insisted to Sen. Rand Paul.  But his argument relies on semantics. The NIH watered down its definition of gain-of-function over the last decade to get around a funding pause. The funding pause was put in place after accidents involving an engineered bird flu.      
      Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House Chief Medical Advisor and Director of the NIAID, gives and opening statement during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing to examine the federal response to COVID-19 and new emerging variants on January 11, 2022, at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

       (Photo by GREG NASH/POOL/AFP via Getty Images  |   Photographer: Greg Nash/The Hill/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Now the NIH defines gain-of-function research as ""research involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens."" After the NIH changed the definition of gain-of-function research, it was able to avoid the classification in Wuhan after Eco Health Alliance argued that these particular bat viruses did not spread among humans - even though they were planning to test how the viruses would mutate to threaten humans. ""There were lots of warnings that Chinese science was becoming an increasing threat to the rest of the world"" says Metzl. FAUCI'S GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH AND WHY I'LL CONTINUE TO HOLD HIM, HIS ALLIES ACCOUNTABLE Almost all experts argue that Eco Health Alliance's research clearly comes under the gain-of-function umbrella. But it’s not just the classification, it’s the way the NIH approves the funding for this kind of research which is also opaque.  For example, in 2012 after the accidents with bird flu, a funding pause was put in place and an NIH review group was set up to oversee any funding of this kind.  The group was known informally as a ""Ferrets Committee,"" but nobody knows who was on it. The group's work was confidential and no records of its proceedings are public. Then in 2017, the NIH watered down this committee’s power to block projects; recasting the panel as strictly an advisory body, which effectively put all the power back in the hands of the NIH. The NIH was basically overseeing itself, and that continues to this day. The funding pause was lifted using the new definition, and it was back to business as usual.

       On top of all this, an independent review process is supposed to be carried out before any funding of risky  research  goes ahead, but experts involved have told Fox News that the reviews are often not done, done poorly or simply ignored. Experts all argue it has to change. Doctor Roland Weisendanger said, ""We need independent agencies to control this, like for nuclear power reactors."" Australian professor Nikolai Petrovsky said, 'Not all gain-of-function research sets out to create harmful pathogens, but it can happen by accident. That is unfortunate, but we should not throw the baby out with the bath water as a result."" ""We have to be careful to distinguish what might be just a chance event in a laboratory where a virus became adapted to human cells, and from there was able to jump from a Petri dish to one of the people handling that virus. And that would have no sinister connotations at all. We have to accept there is some risk of laboratory experiments, and we try and manage those risks that we shouldn't be banning laboratory experiments,"" Petrovsky explained. Republican  congressmen on Thursday called on the seven scientists who reversed their opinions about the lab-leak theory in Wuhan to provide answers under oath after scientists changed their views after speaking with Dr. Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins. Last year, the State Department acknowledged that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had not disclosed gain-of-function research linked to the bat related coronavirus and had engaged in research on behalf of the Chinese military. Many experts agreed that has really changed - particularly when it comes to China. ""China is, in many ways, a wild west of scientific research,"" Metzl said. The point is, however you look at it, and whether you acknowledge there must be some risk for scientific progress - or whether you believe this is tampering with nature unnecessarily - that almost everyone should agree that this is a murky world, where scientists hide behind classifications, and shifting definitions, all without having to disclose exactly what the purpose of the research is. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Certainly there is a growing belief in government that a 9/11-style commission needs to look into the origins of COVID-19, and into how taxpayer dollars are used to fund gain-of-function research to ensure that another pandemic never happens again.   "

I find it astonishing that Young, Mitchell, Nash, Lofgren and Arie can’t grasp this notion.    Today, powerful pro-government propagandists like Young and Mitchell and their allies in the mainstream media label the questioning of vaccines as ""misinformation,"" even though more people have died of COVID in post-vaccine America. They freely make these blanket statements about misinformation from anti-establishment sources like Rogan, but pay no mind to the lies perpetrated about Christopher Steele’s phony dossier, Russian collusion, or that President Trump was a Russian asset. The double standard is appalling and the American people are tired of it.     CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The act of questioning authority and the free flow of different points of view are American ideals and part of what makes America an exceptional nation. From Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King Jr. to Neil Young to Joe Rogan, everyone has a right to speak out here.    When Neil Young recently said that Spotify ""can have Rogan or Young.

"Rand Paul seeking answers on COVID origins, gain-of-function research from 'convention of civilized countries'",Audrey Conklin," February 4, 2022 1:22pm EST","  close     Video   Risky gain of function research is mired in secrecy after the coronavirus pandemic   Fox News State Department correspondent Benjamin Hall reports on the murky world of gain of function research after the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China is suspected of starting the pandemic. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   FIRST ON FOX:   Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky., says he will advocate for an ""international convention of civilized countries"" to gather and discuss the dangers of  gain-of-function research . Paul has been one of few leaders in  Congress  pressing for a hearing on the origins of  COVID-19 . The National Institutes of Health (NIH) last year  acknowledged  its efforts to fund gain-of-function research on bats infected with coronaviruses at a lab in Wuhan, China, before COVID-19 broke out and forever altered life around the world. ""Not only do we need restrictions in our country,"" Paul told Fox News Digital in an interview of the research method. ""I'm going to be advocating for an international convention of civilized countries to come together and discuss gain-of-function research and the potential harm it could cause on a global scale."" RAND PAUL: COVID EDICTS THAT MAKE NO SCIENTIFIC SENSE DESERVE A ‘MASSIVE BOYCOTT’ ""The chances are that [COVID-19] came from the lab —  and…we're up to approximately six to seven million people dead throughout the world now — and this with about 1% mortality. If the next virus that gets out has a 15% or 50% mortality…we essentially destroy the underpinnings of civilization,"" Paul said.     
      Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, speaks with members of the media following a vote in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2022. 
       (Al Drago/Bloomberg) Gain-of-function research involves extracting viruses from animals to artificially engineer in a laboratory to make them more transmissible and deadly to humans. The purpose of such research is to let scientists get ahead of the curb in developing treatments for certain infectious diseases. Demands for answers surrounding the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan in November 2019, have led to calls for White House Chief Medical Adviser  Dr. Anthony Fauci's  resignation and a general feeling of distrust between some citizens and government leaders. RAND PAUL VISITS THE BIG BOARD BAR IN DC: ‘ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO RESIST THE MAN IS SOMEBODY I WANT TO MEET’ Fauci has previously denied U.S. involvement in gain-of-function research at a Wuhan research lab called the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has investigated in its search for answers regarding COVID-19's origins.  However, a $600,000 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which Fauci serves as director, went to a group called EcoHealth Alliance, which then paid the Wuhan lab to study the risk that bat coronaviruses could infect humans. NIH Acting Director Lawrence Tabak previously accused EcoHealth Alliance of not being transparent about the work that was taking place in the lab.

The global health agency  finally arrived  in mid-January of 2021 and released initial findings a month later stating that it was ""extremely unlikely"" the virus came from a lab and advised ""future studies."" The organization said later in July 2021 that it would correct multiple errors in its initial report. RAND PAUL RIPS FAUCI FOLLOWING LATEST HEARING FIREWORKS: HE DOESN'T WANT DEBATE BECAUSE HE ‘IS SCIENCE’ A May  Wall Street  Journal   report citing previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence documents found some of the Wuhan Institute of Virology workers who fell ill in 2019 required hospital care, lending weight to what some have dubbed the ""lab-leak theory."" In an August 2021  statement , WHO admitted that the COVID-19 lab-leak theory was not ""extremely unlikely"" after all. ""I don't think it's over,"" Paul said of the political discussion surrounding COVID-19. ""I think people ultimately are going to be very disappointed that Democrats didn't hold one hearing on the origin of the virus. I've been asking for a year for the two committees I'm on that can look into this —  Homeland Security and the Health Committee —  asking for a hearing on the origins of the virus. It really doesn't have to be partisan.""

The Kentucky senator does not think it is likely that he will be able to hold a hearing on the origins of COVID-19 until after the November 2022 midterm elections, if Republicans take control of the Senate.

   Europe  is entering a ""plausible endgame"" to the  COVID-19 pandemic  as the number of deaths across the region begins to ""plateau,"" the director of the  World Health Organization's (WHO) Europe office  said Thursday.  Speaking at a media briefing, Dr. Hans Kluge said that countries have a ""singular opportunity to take control of"" transmission due to high levels of immunization from  vaccination  and natural immunity, the tendency for coronavirus to spread less in warmer weather and the lower severity of the omicron variant that is ""now well established.""  CDC DIRECTOR: STUDIES YET TO SHOW BA.2 SUB-VARIANT EVADING CURRENT VACCINES MORE THAN OMICRON ""This context, that we have not experienced so far in this pandemic, leaves us with the possibility for a long period of tranquility and a much higher level of population defense against any re-surge in transmission, even with a more virulent variant,""  he said .  Kluge said the period of ""higher protection"" should be seen as a ""cease-fire"" that could bring the region ""enduring peace"" on the condition that it continues to vaccinate and boost, there is strong governmental oversight and commitment with a focus on the ""five stabilizers for the most vulnerable"" and that the region promotes self-protecting behavior and individual responsibility.

Kluge said that it is because the organization sees the top priority as bringing all countries to a level of protection that allows them to ""grasp this opportunity and look ahead towards more stable days"" – a future that demands a ""drastic and uncompromising increase in vaccine-sharing across borders.""  ""We cannot accept vaccine inequity for one more day,"" he urged, echoing  previous calls from WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus .  HEALTHY ADULTS DELIBERATELY INFECTED WITH COVID-19 IN WORLD'S FIRST 'HUMAN CHALLENGE STUDY' Scientists   have previously warned that  unless the majority of the world’s population is vaccinated, any opportunities for COVID-19 to keep spreading means it could mutate into deadlier and more transmissible forms. Kluge pointed out that the hospitalizations in the European region were on the rise – mainly in the unvaccinated – and that it had recorded 12 million new cases in the past week: the highest weekly case incidence since the start of the pandemic.  ""This rise, however, is not as rapid as the case incidence rate – and overall, admissions to intensive care have not increased significantly,"" he said.  Numerous countries in Europe, like Britain and Denmark, have loosened or dropped COVID-19 restrictions after saying that a surge of omicron has peaked.  Some, like Spain, are considering whether to label omicron an endemic problem.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We are concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines – and because of omicron’s high transmissibility and lower severity — preventing transmission is no longer possible and no longer necessary,"" Tedros said at WHO’s Geneva headquarters on Tuesday.

The agency has cautioned that even countries with high levels of vaccination should not cave to  political pressure  and release all of their coronavirus measures at once.

SEN. RAND PAUL:  You know, I think the dirty little secret is it's always been more about submission. It's always been more about collectivism. It's been about growing government power over your lives because the science has been clear for a long time on masks for children. Sweden didn't have their school kids wear masks at all. Not one child died. The incidence of the disease and the teachers did not rise, with the kids not wearing masks. I mean, it's sort of, you know, I worry about the future of America if the Europeans are leading us toward freedom. The Canadians are ahead of us in trying to unwind mandates. But yes, for goodness sakes, we've got to stop the ridiculous mandates on children that Dr. Emanuel, that you put forward saying that kids are dying from omicron. The statistics are this and the science is this. The wild variant was a thousand times less deadly for kids than 80-year-olds, and it's become progressively less dangerous to the delta, to the omicron.  … As far as whether you vaccinate your kids, that's up to you. But there should be no mandate. And I think particularly for young males, the evidence is pretty strong now that the more vaccines you give young males, the higher their incidence of myocarditis. I personally, if you were asking me about your children, I would get them checked first to see if they've already had COVID. If a child has already had COVID, I don't think they need any treatment.

   A recent controversial Johns Hopkins  meta-analysis  reignites a discussion about the adverse consequences of lockdowns after finding they had no significant mortality benefit during the first wave of the 2020 pandemic in the United States and Europe, according to a recent  report .  ""We find no evidence that lockdowns, school closures, border closures and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality,"" said the authors of the study, which is not peer-reviewed and reflects the authors' views, not necessarily those of the  university .   The study authors, however, did find closing nonessential businesses reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.6%, which is likely most related to the closure of  bars .     'SHOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND': LOCKDOWNS ONLY REDUCED COVID DEATH RATE BY .2%, STUDY FINDS ""Our study shows the benefits [of lockdowns] — in terms of fewer deaths — are questionable and small,"" Jonas Herby, special advisor at the Center for Political Studies in Copenhagen, Denmark, told Fox News. Herby's research focuses on law and economics, and he is a co-author of the study.  The  meta-analysis  – a  survey or study of previous studies  – which Herby wrote along with two other prominent economists, noted lockdowns have had ""devastating effects"" as society weathers the unintended consequences. ""They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence and undermining liberal democracy,"" the report  noted .

But the study excluded the research because it relied on modeling, according to multiple  reports .   ""This report on the effect of ‘lockdowns’ does not significantly advance our understanding of the relative effectiveness of the plethora of public health measures adopted by different countries to limit COVID-19 transmission,"" Ferguson posted on  Science Media Centre , a United Kingdom liaison of information for science and health journalists.   Ferguson resigned his government post on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies in May 2020 after breaking lockdown protocol himself when his lover, Antonia Staats, crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions while lockdown measures were imposed, according to the  Guardian . MAJOR MEDIA IGNORE STUDY FINDING COVID LOCKDOWNS INEFFECTIVE The Johns Hopkins researchers acknowledged a limitation of the study was excluding certain studies like Ferguson’s to avoid biases, such as those brought on by ""time-dependent factors"" like seasonality. So papers that looked at early lockdowns such as in China, which suppressed COVID-19 to very low death rates, were also not included, according to a United Kingdom  report .   Nevertheless, lockdowners are now weathering the aftershocks that persist after the lockdowns have been lifted, according to multiple reports.     Video ""There are long-term health consequences from the virus, including long COVID, and there are long-term mental health impacts from the death due to COVID-19 of a parent, spouse, grandparent, caregiver,"" said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chair of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.   ""There are long-term health impacts of the measures used to slow down the spread of this virus.""    By the end of June 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that, due to COVID-19 concerns, approximately 41% of United States adults delayed or avoided medical care, including 12% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 32% who neglected routine care. Those findings noted a higher prevalence among people with multiple medical problems, Black and Hispanic adults, young adults and persons with disabilities, according to a past Morbidity and Mortality Weekly  Report .   Even though most students are now back in school, many now struggle academically from the consequences of months of online learning, while some others opted to switch schools or even drop out, according to a recent New York Times  report .

A few hours later, another call. They were back in. LIVE UPDATES: BEIJING OLYMPICS       They barely had enough time to grab their uniforms out of their packed bags — a flight home had been booked for Monday — jump in a cab and get from the Olympic Village to the Ice Cube for a game against Switzerland. Highlighting a day they’ll never forget, Gill threw the takeout shot that resulted in a three-ender, or three points, that tied the game at 6 in the sixth end.

Coincidentally, the Aussies’ final game of the round robin was later Sunday against Morris and his new partner, Rachel Homan.

With that, the Aussies were back in. Gill had COVID-19 before the Olympics and had been allowed to compete under the close contact program, at least until the positive tests late Saturday. ""It’s just been the craziest time,"" Gill said. ""It was down to the wire, pretty much. The medical team, they were able to review it. I’m so grateful that they put forward a good case. It just shows I’m not infectious."" After getting cleared to play, it was such a scramble digging through her luggage, literally ripping out clothes to get to her uniform, that Gill grabbed the wrong glove. ""It was really crazy, but I think the fact that we were able to regroup, refocus and pull it off is really cool, and definitely something we’re going to take as a learning development going forward,"" she said. ""It’s just been the most amazing experience."" Gill and Hewitt were the first Australian curlers to qualify for the Olympics.

We’re so stoked and we can’t wait for our next game as well."" Rios said the Swiss found out just before getting on the bus to the Ice Cube that Gill had tested positive. ""Now we have two years of experience with the epidemic, so it’s back to unexpected,"" he said. Curlers are known for their camaraderie and sportsmanship. Rios said he was glad the game was played and that they didn’t have to accept a forfeit win. ""We showed up here and there was no official forfeit. I prefer a deserved loss to a forfeit win, to be honest,"" Rios said. ""They are nice guys and I hope they’re well and can enjoy the rest of this. They’re good curlers. Of course, they were 0-7, but we knew they would give us a hard time on the ice."" The Swiss had a three-ender in the fourth end for a 4-3 lead but couldn’t hold on. ""They fought back and in the end we were not able to fight back again, and so they deserved to win,"" Rios said.  "

   An  unvaccinated  father in New Brunswick,  Canada , lost custody of his children, including an  immunocompromised  10-year-old, after a judge ruled in favor of the mother late last month, according to reports.  The parents, who were not identified in the court ruling, had separated in 2019 but shared custody of their three kids. Last year, the mother asked to have the custody agreement changed because the father and his new wife refuse to be vaccinated and in light of their daughter’s ongoing treatment for non-cancerous tumors in her blood vessels, according to CBC News.  Justice Nathalie Godbout said she made the decision with a ""heavy heart"" but it was necessary for the child’s health amid the  coronavirus  pandemic and the recent effects of the omicron variant.  The court also ruled that despite the father’s lack of consent, the mother could vaccinate the children.

   Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel issued an apology after claiming that unvaxxed children are at risk of contracting a ""serious condition"" from the omicron variant of the  coronavirus  during an  MSNBC  interview Wednesday. ""With the omicron variant, kids are either going to get the vaccine or they’re likely to get a serious condition of omicron,"" Emanuel said on ""Andrea Mitchell Reports.""

   Washington Post  media columnist Margaret Sullivan was dragged on social media for using the death of ""beloved"" staffer Miguel Rodriguez as an opportunity to slam Joe Rogan and free speech. Sullivan, formerly The Buffalo News chief editor, released her column Sunday which lamented the death of Rodriguez, a ""well-respected"" reporter for The Buffalo News, who was unvaccinated and passed away last week after battling  COVID-19 .  Even though Rodriguez had underlying health conditions, like asthma and obesity, that put him at more of a risk, and even though the columnist admitted that she was unaware if Rodriguez even tuned into Rogan’s podcast, she still blamed his death on outside influence on his decision to remain unvaccinated. DR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL ISSUES APOLOGY FOR FALSE COVID CLAIM IN MSNBC INTERVIEW: ‘ I MISSPOKE’ ""I don’t know for sure whether getting vaccination and booster shots would have saved Miggy’s life. And I have no idea whether he had ever listened to Joe Rogan’s podcast, or what his precise reasons were for not being vaccinated,"" she said.  ""What I’ve gleaned is that friends had been pushing him to get vaccinated for months but that he and his family hadn’t been convinced that it was wise or necessary.""

""Imagine if Rogan were to use his incredibly powerful voice — he has some 11 million listeners per episode — to talk productively about all of this, to counter some of the destructive bilge instead of adding to it,"" she wrote. Critics ripped Sullivan’s column, including ""The Megyn Kelly Show"" executive producer Steve Krakauer, who called it ""morally bankrupt"" in a tweet. ""What a morally bankrupt column… co-opting the death of a ""beloved"" colleague to spread pro-censorship misinformation - because if he HAD listened to Joe Rogan, he’s have(sic) been urged to get vaccinated, as Rogan has said many times for someone who is ""overweight and asthmatic,"" he tweeted.

The Freedom Convoy has garnered enormous popular support but is condemned by the liberal media and dismissed by Canada’s unpopular  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  as a ""small fringe minority.""  Prodded by Canadian authorities,  GoFundMe moved to confiscate  and redistribute $10 million raised to support the drivers, prompting such outrage that they pivoted to returning the money to the original donors. A like-minded U.S. group, ""Convoy to DC 2022,"" attracted 130,000 members to its Facebook page before it was taken down by the social media giant.   JOE ROGAN-NEIL YOUNG SPOTIFY FEUD – WHO'S ROCKIN' IN THE FREE WORLD NOW? Meanwhile, Joe Rogan has come under blistering attack for hosting on his podcast a cardiologist and infectious disease expert who questions the efficacy and safety of the COVID vaccines. Rogan is viewed as such a threat that the White House – in effect, the president of the United States – is trying to shut him down.    Video You have to wonder, why is the establishment in full panic mode every time someone challenges their COVID orthodoxy?   When historians review how our nation dealt with this pandemic, our political leaders will be excused for mistakes made. In responding to a fast-moving once-in-a-lifetime virus that threatened wholesale death, our mayors and governors – and two presidents – made quick decisions based on inadequate information but recommended by health experts who did the best they could. Those will be forgiven.  What is not forgivable and should never be excused is that those same political leaders and medical authorities brooked no dissent, allowed no debate, and by pretending they had unassailable ""truths"" on their side, undoubtedly caused the deaths of many Americans.   Joe Biden’s White House was reluctant to acknowledge the vaccines’ shortcomings and slow to admit that their efficacy declined rapidly over time   Discussions about possible therapies and treatments have been forbidden, even though creditable doctors have attested to the value of drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, based on their own experience.   When Dr. Simone Gold and her colleagues attested to the success they had treating COVID patients with hydroxychloroquine, she was banned from every major social media site and smeared by the press. But a team at Henry Ford Health System in southeast Michigan announced in July 2020 that a study of 2,541 hospitalized patients found that those given hydroxychloroquine were much less likely to die.  When a Pennsylvania doctor prescribed ivermectin for a patient she was fired. Just recently, clinical trials in Japan suggest the drug inspires an anti-viral reaction and could be a useful remedy for COVID patients.    Video Similarly, challenges to lockdowns and mask mandates have been viewed as undermining society and those voicing dissent viewed as heretics.    It is not as though the ""authorities"" have gotten it right. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been pilloried by the intelligentsia for refusing to impose lockdowns or mask or vaccine mandates, but his state has witnessed fewer deaths per capita from the latest omicron surge than New York, which has required all those supposed preventatives.  A recent Johns Hopkins study concluded that locking down our economy only reduced the COVID death toll by 0.2%, while inflicting grave injury on our country; the authors said the approach should be ""rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.""     Video Joe Rogan’s great offense was to interview Dr. Robert Malone, who challenged the efficacy of the vaccines, points he reiterated in a recent speech in D.C.  ""Regarding the genetic COVID vaccines, the science is settled, they are not working.""   The Washington Post, reviewing his remarks, thundered that Malone was promulgating ""falsehoods"" and ""misinformation."" The Post writers noted that the doctor’s comments came on the heels of a CDC study showing that the vaccines protect against hospitalization from omicron.  That seems true, and incredibly valuable, but it is also true that the vaccines failed to meet their original promise, which was to prevent infection from and transmission of COVID-19. The surge in delta and then omicron cases grew to record numbers in the U.S. even as a growing number of people were vaccinated.     Video Joe Biden’s White House was reluctant to acknowledge the vaccines’ shortcomings and slow to admit that their efficacy declined rapidly over time. Skepticism over the shots grew; confusion led to the U.S. falling way behind in booster shots, costing many lives.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In issuing an apology about his podcast, Rogan pointed out that ""Eight months ago, if you said if you get vaccinated you can still catch COVID and you can still spread COVID – you will be removed from social media … Now, that’s accepted as fact."" He is right.   One of the most popular articles at The Hill recently described the CDC’s ""finally recognizing ‘natural immunity,"""" something that the health agency had previously refused to do. A report from the CDC concluded, based on a review of people in California and New York, that being vaccinated prevented the worst effects of COVID-19, but so did surviving the disease. In fact, the researchers note that ""after delta became prevalent, natural immunity was more protective against infection than vaccination.""    Video The Hill author notes that, ""Many European countries recognize that immunity due to prior infection is equal to vaccination"" and summarizes that, ""Not exempting those with prior infection was always unfair; now it is unscientific as well.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hundreds of thousands of workers have protested the vaccine mandates ordered by Biden; many have argued that because they have already survived the virus, they have natural immunities and need no further protection. The authorities refused to consider their argument, just as they have refused to admit that masks provide minimal benefits to children and in fact could be harmful.  Biden campaigned on the promise that he had a plan to ""shut down the virus."" The United States now has a higher per capita death rate than any other developed country, which was not the case when Biden took office. Clearly his administration is doing something wrong.

       (The Bronx Little Italy) On Monday, Jan. 24, a New York Supreme Court judge  struck down  the state's mask mandate as ""unconstitutional."" The next morning, Adams announced, ""We're going to continue our mandates in schools."" The state education department told  The New York Post  that masks were still required in schools because the Hochul administration had appealed the decision. An appeals court judge  temporarily reinstated  the mandate on Tuesday afternoon. According to the New York City Department of Education  website , ""All students are required to wear masks while on school grounds, and students who were exposed must wear a well-fitting mask such as a KN95, KF94, or a cloth mask over a disposable surgical mask on Days 6–10.""

   CNN political analyst and Politico White House correspondent Laura Barrón-López claimed a recent political ad attacking hypocritical mask policies pushed by  celebrities  and  politicians  as ""not truthful or honest."" During Sunday’s ""Inside Politics"" highlighted an ad put out by N2 America, a right-leaning group that focuses on suburban Americans, criticized Democrats and teacher unions for pushing mandatory mask policies in schools.  The ad shows kids watching adults in sporting events and celebrities at an award show maskless, later contrasted with pictures of kids at school in masks.  SEN.

       (Michael Loccisano/Getty Images) Host Abby Phillips discussed the growing resentment parents have felt regarding masking mandates with Barrón-López. ""More parents now say in polls, that they would rather their kid be in a consistent, educational setting. Yes, most schools are open, but not have the disruptions of the pandemic, than they are worried about their kid getting COVID. And, you know, you’re a parent, every parent has to make those choices,"" Phillips said before playing N2's ad.  Phillips acknowledged parents’ frustrations by referencing the recent scandals surrounding Democrats like Governor  Gavin Newsom  and Los Angeles Mayor  Eric Garcetti  who were  photographed without masks  during a football game.

       (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Barrón-López, however, pushed back against the ad, claiming that it wasn’t ""truthful or honest"" about Republican policies towards masks. ""I mean, look, that’s a political ad, so it’s not going to be truthful or honest or any of those things. What’s also happening here, is that Republicans for the majority of this pandemic have told their base, have told people in their states, don’t wear masks, don’t get vaccinated. We may even give you incentives to not get vaccinated, you know, you die, okay. Like, that’s the way they’ve treated this pandemic,"" Barrón-López said. ""And that’s contributed to the fact that their children can’t go back to school. That kids can’t go back to school because people are deciding that they don’t want to get vaccinated and care about other people.""  She added ""That’s a part of this whole thing, that if you had asked any of us 10 or 12 years ago, that that’s the way that this country would have handled a pandemic, I don’t think we would have said that, which is that it would have been become such a culture war under public health, but that’s what the administration is also facing."" Politico national correspondent Meredith McGraw weighed in and said that parents see Democrats like Newsom maskless at public events and get upset at the inconsistent messaging.  DR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL ISSUES APOLOGY FOR FALSE COVID CLAIM IN MSNBC INTERVIEW: ‘I MISSPOKE’   ""I think a lot of people are looking for an exit ramp right now. There’s such pandemic fatigue at this point. And I think when you see photos like that one of Newsom and Garcetti at the L.A. Rams stadium in Los Angeles, it’s hard for a lot of people to stomach the idea that their kids can’t take their mask off unless they’re eating, and yet they can see public figures at a huge, crowded event be able to take their masks off and sort of live their lives. So I think a lot of people are just really desperate and looking for some sort of consistent messaging on how we can move forward,"" McGraw said.

   It’s hard enough facing a deep and talented hockey powerhouse such as Canada in normal circumstances. Try doing it wearing a mask, Russian forward Alexandra Vafina joked. ""Against Canada with the mask on? It was an experience,"" she said following a 6-1 loss in a Group A preliminary round matchup, which became the first  Olympic  women’s hockey game to require all players to wear masks. LIVE UPDATES: BEIJING OLYMPICS       ""It’s not enough oxygen,"" Vafina said. ""So for us in the first period was pretty hard, but we adjusted to that."" COVID-19, which has the Beijing Games' participants limited to living and competing inside a tightly controlled bubble environment, nearly derailed the on-ice action Monday. Forward Oxana Bratisheva, speaking through a team interpreter, said Russian Olympic Committee players were initially told the game against Canada was being postponed, before it was decided to push back the opening faceoff by 65 minutes. At issue was that the Russian COVID-19 testing results from earlier in the day were not yet available by game time. After both teams took part in the pregame warmup, the Canadians stayed in the locker room awaiting the ROC results.

The International Ice Hockey Federation reached a compromise, getting both teams to agree to wear masks. The Russians eventually took off theirs for the start of the third period after the tests revealed no additional positive results, while the Canadians finished with masks on.

Canada pulled forward Emily Clark from the lineup after her test result came back inconclusive. ""We’re so used to rolling with the punches,"" Canadian forward Brianne Jenner said of the initial delay and the mask-wearing requirement. ""We were just keeping it light. We were laughing, joking in the room, dancing. We were just ready for anything. If we’ve got to play in these again, we will."" Canada improved to 3-0 in the final tuneup before the team closes the preliminary round against archrival United States (3-0) on Tuesday.

Nurse and Rebecca Johnston had a goal and an assist each, while Marie-Philip Poulin, Erin Ambrose and Jamie Lee Rattray also scored. Canada, which experienced a COVID-19 breakout in late December, benefited from having spent part of its four-month pre-Olympic camp practicing with masks for precautionary reasons. ""Obviously it’s not ideal, but we made it through,"" Spooner said. ""And I think the best thing about this team is we have fun with whatever we’re doing and we made the best of it.

Her coach Yevgeni Bobariko, however, dismissed any talk of forfeiture. ""No, no, no. We were not considering that possibility because we respect every team that we play against, and Canada is not an exception,"" Bobariko said through a team interpreter. ""We were ready to play this game whenever they said to us — 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m. midnight,"" he added. ""We were going to play this game anyway.

   Every American should be worried about the  COVID Generation . Over the past two years, our country’s children have lost a huge part of their education – and they’re now at risk of losing their futures.  Rescuing these kids is urgently important, for their sake and our nation’s.  Today’s students  are tomorrow’s leaders, and if they aren’t prepared, America itself won’t be able to lead. What’s happening to kids breaks my heart. Even before the pandemic, they were struggling to find the best shot at the best life. Pre-COVID, two-thirds of America’s elementary and middle-school students weren’t proficient in reading. Nearly the same number weren’t proficient at math. Yet instead of helping kids get ahead, the  past two years  pushed them further behind. WAR ON CRITICAL RACE THEORY: GOV. NOEM EMERGES AS NATIONAL LEADER IN FIGHT AGAINST CLASSROOM INDOCTRINATION School lockdowns and virtual learning have been a total disaster. It’s now clear that school lockdowns had nearly zero effect on saving lives, but they did dramatic damage to student’s lives. Almost 100% of teachers reported seeing their students fail to learn during the pandemic, and sure enough, the typical K-12 student is now four months behind in reading and five months behind in math.    Video Black and Brown students suffered even more – they lost half a year. Low-income income students lost even more than that. These are the kinds of kids I grew up with in rural South Carolina. Their futures depend on a great education they’re just not getting. Even one lost day of learning is unacceptable. Six months is unthinkable. You can’t afford to be six months behind when you’re a sixth grader learning algebra. You can’t afford it when you’re in 12th grade preparing to go to college or get a job. And if you spent half of first grade missing out, you’re going to spend the rest of your life trying to catch up. As a mother, it pains me to think about the future these kids are facing. The mental health issues, the lack of social skills, the lessons that were never learned – the COVID Generation is in for a rough ride. We’re failing to prepare the citizens who will soon be called on to defend our freedom and lead the world.   You think we have a labor crisis now? Imagine how much worse things will get when these students graduate and try to get jobs. Millions won’t have the training and skills they need. The typical student could already make $61,000 less in life because of how they were taught – or rather, not taught – during the pandemic.  And we aren’t even done with this crisis. Our students deserve the best life possible, not a life of missed opportunities and unmet potential. Not only that: if this crisis continues, do you think America can compete with the world? We closed schools and hurt kids far more than many other countries. Our economy will suffer for years if something doesn’t change fast. So will our national security.    Video We’re failing to prepare the citizens who will soon be called on to defend our freedom and lead the world. America is in a life-or-death struggle with countries like Communist China. How we raise the next generation of Americans will determine whether we win. Saving the COVID generation is a moral necessity. Yet at the exact moment our country’s children need help, in so many cases, they’re being hurt even more. Today’s Democratic Party is joined at the hip with teachers’ unions. These are the same unions that fought to keep schools closed for months on end and are now shutting down schools once again from coast to coast. Apparently they’re more concerned with suspending students who don’t wear masks than teaching students to read, write and rise.   Video What’s worse, Democrats and their activist allies are pushing dangerous concepts like critical race theory on students. They’re telling a 5-year-old White girl she’s racist, and if she’s Black or Brown, they’re telling her she’s a helpless victim who will never be good enough. Such low expectations are just high-minded bigotry. We should help students unlock their unique potential, not lump them into groups based on race and gender. We should enable every student to lift themselves up, not tear them down. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Our country’s children deserve better. Parents are demanding better. And Republicans are ready to deliver better. We stand for educating kids, full stop.  That’s why Republican governors and state lawmakers are passing real school choice that gives every family the freedom to pick the best education for their kids. And we stand for teaching kids what they need to succeed – and what America needs to survive and thrive.    Video Students should learn to love our country, not loathe it, which is why GOP-led states are stopping critical race theory in its tracks. Students should see that while our nation isn’t perfect, they’re still blessed to live in America, and they have a role in making our union more perfect. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The past two years made clear that education needs a transformation from top to bottom. It’s failing the people who are our future, when it should be helping them claim that future.  We can’t let the COVID generation become the lost generation. They’re counting on us.

   Democratic  gubernatorial  candidate  Stacey Abrams  faced serious backlash over the weekend after posing maskless in a  classroom  filled with masked children, but  CNN  political commentator Bakari Sellers is coming to her defense. In an appearance with CNN’s ""New Day"" on Monday, Sellers argued that if his kid were in the classroom, he would ""definitely not"" be outraged – neither from a public health perspective, nor the assumption that Abrams made a mistake. ""If my kid was in the classroom, would I be outraged? The answer is definitely not,"" he said. ""Stacey Abrams is not trying to harm children, she was not flaunting regulations purposefully…so there’s not an issue there."" The commentator went on to explain that the negative media attention Abrams has received as a result will only set her back politically, and suggested that she most likely ""wants the day back.""

""The people who were outraged weren’t going to vote for Stacey Abrams anyway…Now, she’s going to lose a week or two having to deal with this issue which is, for the most part, a non-issue.""

GoFundMe's left-wing roadblock – Canada truckers not the first cause targeted by crowdfunding site,Jonathan Turley," February 7, 2022 1:36pm EST","  close     Video   Social media companies have created alternative to 'state media': Turley   Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley reacts to the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe's decision to shut down the Canadian 'Freedom Convoy's' campaign on 'Fox Report.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   GoFundMe's suspension of millions to support  protesting truckers in Canada  shocked many, particularly when the company initially announced its intention to distribute the money to other charities.   It was less of a surprise for those of us who have  criticized the company  for years over its use of the platform to target and block funds for conservative and libertarian causes. Indeed, the company has revised an old practice known as the ""Nag's Head light"" in luring the unsuspecting into what has become a liberal lockbox on funds. GOFUNDME, NOW NIXING CANADIAN TRUCKER FUNDRAISER, PROMOTED CAPITOL HILL OCCUPIED PROTEST APPEAL In the Carolinas, locals would sometimes tie a lantern under the head of a horse to lure ships to their doom. Thinking the light was a ship in deep water, the ships would unwittingly sail into the shore rocks, where they would be stripped of their cargo. That is how the resort town Nag's Head,  North Carolina , got its name. GoFundMe is the ultimate Nag's Head operation. It draws conservative and libertarian causes to its shore with promises of being a neutral crowdfunding site. At its creation, the founders pledged to change the world by ""disrupting giving"" by handing control to average people in supporting others with common values and views.   Video The easy-to-use technology and need for crowdfunding services quickly expanded the company into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. However, it soon became clear that the company was using its control of funds to advance its own political agenda. Worse yet, the company effectively coaxed groups into fundraising campaigns on its site, only to freeze accounts before the money could be used. GOFUNDME BACKTRACKS ON REDISTRIBUTING MONEY FOR CANADIAN TRUCKERS, UNDER THREAT OF FRAUD INVESTIGATION In the case of the Canadian truckers protesting COVID mandate, the company perfectly replicated the Nag's Head light. It allowed people to donate over $10 million, thinking that they were helping the truckers and presumably not donating to other sites. It then suspended the account and announced that it would distribute the money to other charities in consultation with the truckers. Once the ships crashed on its rocks, it was literally going to salvage the wreckage. It is a familiar pattern for the company in allowing people to send money for badly needed support only to lock the funds away at the last minute.   The announcement was breathtakingly moronic and led some to call for criminal investigations. It turns out that soliciting funds for one reason and then using them for another (""better"") cause is considered fraud in some circles. The company quickly backtracked. However, it still refused to allow the donations to go to the truckers. It will return the money.  In the meantime, critical time and support has been lost for those who trusted the company. It is a familiar pattern for the company in allowing people to send money for badly needed support only to lock the funds away at the last minute. The company's record has moved it well beyond any plausible deniability that it is not using access to donations as a way of advancing its own priorities. Consider GoFundMe's freezing of funds for legal defense funds. One would think that funding litigation costs would be unassailable since it is an effort to secure judicial review of the underlying merits of a case or a cause. After all, if a cause is based on disinformation, a court can quickly sort out the truth. Right? Wrong.   Video GoFundMe froze donations needed to support Kyle Rittenhouse's legal defense because he was accused of a violent crime. However, that is the point of a trial. He was  accused  of a crime, and he was entitled to a presumption of innocence. However, the media ran false accounts of the story while social media companies like TikTok censored pro-Rittenhouse material. One police officer was fired for simply donating to Rittenhouse anonymously on GoFundMe. Neither the company nor the media came to the defense of Norfolk Police Officer William Kelly. Rittenhouse was, of course, acquitted. Then GoFundMe released the funds after they were no longer needed to support his trial. The company also suspended litigation funds for accused police officers as well as parents who sought to challenge vaccinate mandates in courts. When the company blocked the distribution of donations to Rittenhouse, it declared, ""GoFundMe’s Terms of Service prohibit raising money for the legal defense of an alleged violent crime.""  TED CRUZ DEMANDS FTC LAUNCH INVESTIGATION INTO GOFUNDME FOR SEIZING TRUCKER CONVOY FUNDS It is a ridiculous policy since defendants have a presumption of innocence and all parties should be able to present their best cases before independent judges. That includes Canadian truckers, Black Lives Matter, Antifa and other groups facing litigation. Moreover, critics have noted that the company has supported legal funds supporting rioters in various cities as well as an appeal for the 2020 Seattle Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP).   Video The hypocrisy of the company on such issues has been flagged repeatedly, including by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It does not matter. Like the social media companies, GoFundMe controls billions in funds and has become the very scourge that it was designed to combat. Rather than empower average people, it now operates more like a corporate overlord on what causes are worthy of crowdfunding. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Notably, GoFundMe relied on accounts from the Canadian government to label the truckers as violent despite the fact that the truckers are protesting the government.  GoFundMe controls billions in funds and has become the very scourge that it was designed to combat. Rather than empower average people, it now operates more like a corporate overlord on what causes are worthy of crowdfunding.   The protests have been largely peaceful, particularly in comparison to the ""mostly peaceful"" protests in past summers (by groups allowed to crowdfund by the company). It is the same pattern used by other companies in serving as a conduit of government priorities and policies.   Video YouTube and Twitter have blocked critics of Vladimir Putin or governments like India. Even the WHO has supported such censorship to deal with what it now calls the ""infodemic,"" which includes criticism of itself. In the United States, Democratic leaders, including President Joe Biden, have pushed for more corporate censorship on subjects ranging from global warming and gender issues to election integrity and vaccines. As companies like Twitter actively silence dissenting voices, GoFundMe has served as a chokepoint for funds. The result is that many are finding it not only difficult to use social media to voice their views but to use crowdfunding to garner the support of like-minded people.   The inclusion of GoFundMe in this increasingly united front is particularly chilling. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, money is a critical part of free speech. You speak through your donations and those funds then support further free speech and associations.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As companies like Twitter actively silence dissenting voices, GoFundMe has served as a chokepoint for funds.

   As Americans mask up during the  coronavirus pandemic , images have repeatedly surfaced with  Democratic  politicians seemingly flaunting their own directions for ordinary citizens. The tension has been especially pronounced in schools where children, who are generally at a low risk for the coronavirus, have been subjected to what many argue are harmful mandates. That tension erupted once again on Friday when Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams was seen sitting in a room full of schoolchildren wearing masks. ""Spending time with Glennwood’s amazing students, faculty and staff ranks as spectacular, delightful and outstanding,"" Abrams said in a  now-deleted post  retweeting the school's principal. STACEY ABRAMS RECEIVES BACKLASH FOR POSING MASKLESS WITH ROOM FULL OF YOUNG MASKED CHILDREN The backlash was swift, with many accusing the Democratic gubernatorial candidate of an especially cruel hypocrisy involving the nation's children.  ""In so many ways, this picture embodies the elitism, arrogance, cruelty, science denial, and glib authoritarianism of Joe Biden’s Democrat Party,"" tweeted America First Legal founder Stephen Miller. Just prior to Abrams' photo surfacing, basketball legend Magic Johnson tweeted photos of himself and maskless leaders in California. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti claimed that he held his breath during his photo with Johnson. ""I wore my mask the entire game,"" Garcetti  reportedly said . ""When people ask for a photograph, I hold my breath and I put it here and people can see that. There is a zero percent chance of infection from that."" Meanwhile, Gov.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Now in its second year, the Biden administration, along with congressional Democrats, is still prescribing the wrong medicine for  healing the economy  during COVID. Despite the narrowest of majorities in the House and Senate, Democrats insist on governing through one-party rule. That’s political malpractice. Americans want commonsense solutions and real results, not political power plays by the majority party. The Democrats’ one-party rule of Washington have blinded them to a fundamental truth –  pandemics  are not partisan. As a leader on the House Ways and Means Committee, I’ve witnessed firsthand how the  White House  and its allies in Congress have consistently misdiagnosed the problems ailing our economy and chosen partisanship over progress. As a result, American families are continuing to suffer from the effects of skyrocketing inflation, stagnant wage growth and an economy that is no longer working for them. FAUCI'S GAIN-OF-FUNCTION CONSPIRACY AND WHY I'LL CONTINUE TO HOLD HIM, HIS ALLIES ACCOUNTABLE Throughout his campaign, President Biden promised to use his many years of experience in Washington to bring the country together with renewed purpose to attack the pandemic. Yet these optimistic assurances – and Biden’s campaign commitments – were quickly thrown aside and replaced with a completely partisan agenda.   Video Soon after his inauguration, the progressive left took charge in Congress. Led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Democrats used a budget procedure known as ""reconciliation"" to pass a massive, partisan $1.9 trillion so-called ""economic relief"" package with no Republican input or support.  Yet despite being advertised as a ""COVID relief package,"" less than 9% of the funding went directly to fight the virus. The rest indulged progressive priorities that dramatically increased wasteful spending and fueled a spike in inflation we have not witnessed in 40 years.  This reckless, liberal spending spree was the direct result of one-party politics. And it’s the American people who pay the price as spiraling costs for food, housing, and energy eat away at their hard-earned paychecks. One-party rule has not addressed this pandemic and improved our country.    Unfortunately, the president’s partisan approach didn’t end with that spending spree. Instead, Democrats decided to double down and ram through yet another entirely partisan bill that would impose crippling tax increases and even more spending in what they called, ironically, the Build Back Better plan.  Here again, Democrats had an opportunity to work together with Republicans to find commonsense solutions, but they chose the partisan path instead. For instance, during our Ways and Means Committee work, Republicans offered amendments that would divert tax dollars away from wasteful spending and toward coronavirus testing, rural health and protecting seniors. But Democrats refused. They chose to prioritize party over public health.   Video The so-called Build Back Better plan passed the House last fall on another party line vote and is – at least for now – stalled in the Senate. And for good reason. This measure contains about $2 trillion in job killing tax increases on individuals and small businesses. It tosses in even more spending that will only exacerbate the historic inflation plaguing the American people and further increases the deficit.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The Democrats’ bill also does nothing to promote longer-term economic growth. Its main emphasis is on the demand-side of the economy, putting short-term money in people’s pockets through a variety of government spending programs. This imbalance – short-term demand-side stimulus without attention to the supply side – is another reason why inflation is now red hot. As a result, a recent report from a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania found that American families spent $3,500 more on average in 2021 than in 2020.  Democrats also had a chance to work with Republicans to find commonsense solutions to the rising cost of prescription drugs for seniors by capping their out-of-pocket costs. I know from my position serving on the Ways and Means Committee that such a solution was possible. Instead, Democrats went their own way, again pursuing partisan policies that impose federal price controls, potentially limiting access to medical innovations and new cures to save lives.   Video Promoting greater retirement savings and security was another missed opportunity to explore new ideas. Last year, the Ways and Means Committee passed a major piece of retirement security legislation that accomplished this on a unanimous, bipartisan vote. But once again, Speaker Pelosi decided to ignore our efforts, and instead approach retirement provisions as a partisan issue in the House Build Back Better bill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The American people are justifiably tired and frustrated with COVID, but they are also quickly losing patience with Democrat politicians that promote partisan power over commonsense solutions. A year into the Biden presidency, Democrats have missed numerous opportunities to bring the country together to fight the virus and grow the economy.  One-party rule has not addressed this pandemic and improved our country. The president and the Democrats have significantly missed the mark on the challenges we face, and what’s needed to heal the nation. Unfortunately for all of us, they don’t understand that pandemics are not partisan. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP. VERN BUCHANAN  "

""USAID’s decision to award EcoHealth Alliance additional federal funding is misguided and deeply concerning,"" Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., said in a statement to Fox News. He and 25 other Republicans sent a letter on Monday to USAID Administrator Samantha Power, requesting additional information about the five-year award granted in October. ""EcoHealth used money from their last federal grant to fund dangerous, gain-of-function coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology before the pandemic,"" Reschenthaler added.  MIKE POMPEO: PETER DASZAK OF ECOHEALTH ALLIANCE HAS WUHAN QUESTIONS TO ANSWER ""Under the leadership of Dr. Peter Daszak, EcoHealth has failed to comply with federal reporting requirements, given the U.S. government the runaround, and attempted to impede research into the lab leak theory.

EcoHealth Alliance and USAID did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. According to  The New York Times , an EcoHealth Alliance spokesperson has cast doubt on their research influencing COVID-19, saying that coronaviruses they studied weren't genetically similar enough.

CWA partners will work with local communities to improve farming practices and sustainable opportunities that reduce reliance on land, wood or wildlife in conservation areas. CWA will support training, technical assistance, equipment, credit and market access, and agricultural and business inputs."" ""CWA was competitively bid and awarded. EcoHealth Alliance has experience monitoring wildlife and understanding forest-disease dynamics in Liberia, and its consortium partners have substantial experience with protected area management and rural development in Liberia."" USAID previously sent a letter to Reschenthaler saying that its ""PREDICT"" program provided EcoHealth Alliance with $1.1 million between October 2009 and May 2019. The money was part of a ""sub-agreement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) for the purpose of advancing research on critical viruses that could pose harm to human and animal health."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""USAID-funded activities carried out by the WIV were consistent with the work performed in other countries that also received related funding. These activities involved testing for viral families (by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in samples collected from wild animals and humans, as well as the development of serologic assays to test for exposure (i.e., antibodies) to coronaviruses in animals and people. These activities were done to identify and understand zoonotic viruses among animal populations before they spillover (i.e., are able to infect humans) and cause potential pandemics in people. USAID never authorized or funded any work that aimed to increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility (research known as 'Gain of Function' studies) at WIV. In addition, USAID never received a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the EcoHealth Alliance requesting a voluntary pause.""

The Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce is asking business owners to let their employees ""play hooky"" from work and step in as substitute teachers.  This latest initiative comes as schools across the U.S. are desperate for subs. In New Mexico, they've called in the  National Guard . In Texas and California, some school districts are asking  parents  to step in.  In Salt Lake City, it could be the banker, barista, dental assistant or electrician teaching your kids.  SCHOOLS RECRUIT PARENTS TO BE SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS AMID COVID STAFFING SHORTAGES ""It just makes plain good sense for our businesses to get involved in education,"" said Ginger Chinn, the vice president of public policy and government affairs for the Salt Lake Chamber. ""This is our future workforce.

In many districts, it's only gotten worse after winter break.  STAFFING SHORTAGES AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS AMERICA CAUSE CANCELATIONS, ANXIETY AMONG PARENTS  ""Because of the high surge of the omicron variant and the number of people who have been sick, the demand for subs has been much higher than normal,"" said Ben Horsley, spokesperson for the Granite School District.  In the first two weeks of the new year, the district says it had nearly 2,000 sub requests.

Now we're in the hundreds.""  Without enough subs in the pool, Horsley says emergency substitutes with the district office have had to step in, including the superintendent.  In other cases, classes have had to double up, or students are brought to an auditorium where one adult can supervise multiple classes.  ""At the end of the day, our goal is to provide quality instruction for students and when we don't have the substitute teachers there to do that, that's just not feasible,"" Horsley said.  UTAH LEGISLATURE ENDS MASK MANDATES, MOVES TOWARD HALTING COVID-19 TESTING IN SCHOOLS  Since partnering with the chamber and reaching out to businesses in early January, the school district says it's received 114 substitute teacher applications.  ""This is a way to make a difference in your community,"" Horsley said. ""I think we all want to know we're making a difference in the world. This is just one small thing that you can do.""

Even the CDC admits the cloth masks aren't working. You see kids outside huddled in the cold, eating their sandwiches. You see kids playing outside in masks. So I think it is bringing right and left together… I think in the end, the Democrats have really overplayed their hand on the mandates, because they're going to lose their populous, they're going to lose their public. So I think this is a turning point. I think it's really getting to the point where the science is clear that the bulk and the vast majority of the masks people are wearing have no difference, make no difference, in the trajectory of the virus.

   A group of  high school  students in the  Chicago  area walked out of class Monday after being told they had to wear masks to attend class.  The walkout came after Sangamon County Circuit Court Judge Raylene Grischow issued a temporary restraining order against Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s requirement that masks be worn in schools to prevent the spread of  COVID-19 .  Video shared on Twitter by Jon J.

       (Annette Letang provided) Community High School District 128 told Fox News that students who refused to wear masks met with their principals and were given the opportunity to explain their position and ask questions.  The district, which includes Libertyville and Vernon Hills High School, said students were given three options Monday: put on a mask to attend class, leave school and have a parent report the absence, or stay in the gym and complete classwork.""  NEW YORK CHEERLEADERS PROTESTING COVID-19 VACCINE REQUIREMENTS AT HS CHAMPIONSHIPS Many parents decried the district's decision to keep the mask mandate in place. Several parents who spoke to Fox News said their kids were left in the gym all day with nothing to do.  ""For two years, we have been living under mandates,"" Libertyville parent Socrates Vela told Fox News. ""My wife and I did not serve in the Army so 20 years later, Illinois bureaucrats could strip our children's rights.""  Another parent, Kim Bissing, told Fox News she was ""proud of students in District 128 today who chose to go against the school's unconstitutional mask mandate.""  ""This is a learning opportunity for them to understand how our government works and when the system has failed, that you must speak up and let your voice be heard.,"" she said.  The district  signaled  over the weekend that it would still be enforcing the mask mandate – except for the named student plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by more than 700 parents at nearly 150 school districts across the state.  The district said the mask mandate has allowed both schools to remain open for in-person learning and extracurricular activities.

She nixed other orders too, including one mandating vaccinations for school employees.  She agreed with the plaintiffs that students may not be excluded from school for health reasons without family consent or a public health quarantine order.  In a news conference Monday, Pritzker said the ruling was ""out of step with the vast majority of legal analysis.""

   Children have a more difficult time recognizing faces that are masked than adults, which could harm their ability to ""navigate through social interactions with their peers and  teachers ,"" according to a newly released study. Erez Freud, a researcher at York University, who published his findings on Monday in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles & Implications.  Freud, along with two professors from Israel’s Ben-Gurion University, gave 72 children between the ages of 6 and 14 the Cambridge Face Memory Test, which measures facial perception abilities by presenting people with and without masks while upright and inverted.  When masks were included in the presentation, it led to a ""profound deficit in face perception abilities"" that was ""more pronounced in children compared to adults,"" according to  the study .

   Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains. That's from Karl Marx, of course. He wrote that famous phrase in 1848. The weird thing is, it's pretty likely that Marx himself never met an actual worker.   Wait a second. He didn't spend a decade in a cotton mill, witnessing the oppression firsthand. No. Karl Marx never spent a moment in a factory. He was a rich kid who became a journalist. Of course he was. But for more than 150 years, Karl Marx inspired generations of other rich kids who also became journalists to repeat his line or variations of it.   Over time, workers became working men or working class and then with feminism, working people or working families, but the idea itself never changed. Ordinary people, wage earners, are getting shafted, so they've got to unite. They've got to come together for protection and for dignity. This was the idea, of course, behind the organized labor movement, and every Democratic president from Andrew Jackson until now has made the very same point over and over again. ""The noble people of Scranton..."" You hear it even today. So, Democrats have repeated that line often enough. You would think they really mean it.  CALIFORNIA’S INDOOR MASK MANDATE WILL END NEXT WEEK FOR VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS, GOV. NEWSOM SAYS     Do they really mean it? Let's take the test. Here's how you know. Watch what happens when actual workers, working people from working families who constitute the working class, actually come together as a group to protest how things are going.   What happens then? Does the intellectual class greet these workers as heroes? Throw a parade? Listen intently to their stories? Does NPR do a sympathetic feature on them? Or, do self-described progressives recoil in revulsion and horror at the grubbiness of the people who as we used to say, work for a living? Do liberals immediately denounce them as Nazis and call for their suppression by force? That's the question. What's the answer? We'll ask  Trump  voters what happens. They'll know.     
      Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, during a news conference from the National Capital Region in Canada on Monday, Jan. 31, 2022. 
       (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Or consider what's happening right now in Canada. Thousands of truck drivers have descended on Ottawa, the capital city, to protest the tyranny of Justin Trudeau's government. Justin Trudeau does not like truck drivers. He thinks they're revolting. Justin Trudeau likes private equity barons and tech moguls, the only people who give him money. Trudeau is not in Ottawa right now. In fact, he and his family fled when the truck drivers arrived and they've been in hiding ever since. So when the revolution he has been calling for finally arrived, Justin Trudeau wasn't there to see it. He ran away in terror, kind of sad.   So instead, in his place, his friend Mark Carney has been speaking for him. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive who many believe will replace Justin Trudeau if Trudeau ever decides to give up power. In a recent op-ed, Mark Carney vented his rage at the impudent truckers in Ottawa and anyone who sent them money on the internet.   ""Anyone sending money to the convoy should be in no doubt,"" Carney wrote. ""You are funding sedition. Foreign funders of an insurrection interfered in our domestic affairs from the start.""   Got it? That is not a protest. It's sedition. It's an insurrection. Clearly, Mark Carney's been watching a lot of CNN up there in Canada and that's why he's concluded the truckers should be crushed by force.   ""Those who are still helping to extend this occupation must be identified and punished to the full force of the law."" People who sent the money should be prosecuted. If they're not prosecuted, Mark Carney fears, ""the constant blaring of horns at all hours will bankrupt our businesses.""   CNN CALLS FREEDOM CONVOY PROTEST ‘SEDITION,’ THREAT TO DEMOCRACY’   Are you laughing yet? So, the very same finance ghouls who cheered lockdowns for two solid years are now deeply concerned that small businesses might be hurt by the trucker protests. Hilarious. It'll be interesting, by the way, to pull small business owners in Ottawa to see what they think. How did they feel about the truckers? Some of you know exactly what those results would be, but no one's doing that poll, of course. Instead, they found an easier way.  Justin Trudeau has just ordered police to shut the whole thing down. How do you do that? How do you stop a truck protest? Simple. You seize their fuel. That's exactly what police in Canada are doing.  TWITTER VIDEO:  So, in fact, yes, they are taking fuel right away for people as they attempt to fuel their vehicles.    OK, so we are, through much practice, connoisseurs of irony. So, let's pause a moment to savor the irony here. The very same people told us we had to defund the police are now telling the police to seize fuel from working-class Canadians who are trying to stay alive in Arctic temperatures.   As they used to say in the 1960s, ""scratch a liberal, and you will find a fascist."" That was a Black Panther slogan, actually. They weren't entirely stupid. In fact, in this case, they were absolutely right.   According to Justin Trudeau, possessing gasoline in the city of Ottawa is now a crime. Now, to be clear, Ottawa didn't declare the state of emergency because the truckers lit a courthouse on fire or shot someone or leveled a church. BLM did all of those things, but Justin Trudeau strongly supports BLM.   He reaffirmed to support the other day. Here's the problem. We're going to let the mayor of Ottawa explain why peaceful truck drivers pose an imminent danger to Canada.    Video CANADIAN-STYLE TRUCKER PROTESTS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD   OTTOWA MAYOR:  It's disturbing when you see the protests turning into what looks like some kind of a fun carnival where they've got bouncy castles and hot tubs and saunas, a complete insult to the people who are putting up with this nonsense for the last seven days, and it shows a great deal of insensitivity.   They've got bouncy castles for kids, growls the childless mayor of Ottawa, let's hurt them. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a dark scene in Truckistan tonight. The kids are on the bouncy castles. Of course, at the same time, their parents are flaunting the authority of the people in charge and that is the crime. One protester, a clear White supremacist, explained his motives for protest.   TWITTER VIDEO: Where the hell were you? You weren't there? But, now you want to come out in the freezing cold to oppose my fundamental human rights and freedoms. I'm not going to have it. I'm a Black man standing beside my brother right here. This is my brother right here and none of you have the right to tell me who to associate with and who not to associate with me because you did not come out and voice your concerns for the fact that Justin Trudeau banned me from leaving this country because of my medical decision, because I made a decision that he did not like.   Shut up, racist. Go back to Jamaica with your White supremacy nonsense. By the way, no one in Canada's government or the media in Canada, which is mostly controlled by the government, is engaging with any of the arguments of people like that. Instead, they've gone directly to force as crumbling regimes always do. They don't have an argument to make. All they have is police power and they're using them. Officials in Ottawa just threatened to criminally investigate the California company GoFundMe because truckers raised about $10 million on the platform. Here's Ottawa's police chief bragging about stealing that money:  CHIEF PETER SLOLY: We have, through the efforts of deputy.... who know the mayor and his staff, we've been able to shut down the GoFundMe program. That's a temporary reprieve because the funds are already moving in different directions. We are now going after supply and fuel coming into the area through investigations and intelligence operations and interdictions, all of which were underway yesterday, fully underway today.   Intelligence operations? This is a peaceful, political protest. No one has shown any evidence to the contrary. It's not a drug trafficking or human trafficking operation. It's not  Al Qaeda . These are Canadian citizens who drive trucks for a living, but they're being treated like a terror group. GoFundMe announced it would redirect the $10 million raised by supporters of the truckers to charities of its choice, presumably BLM, which it has supported since the very beginning. In other words, GoFundMe planned to steal that money.   They were stopped from doing this, by the way, by a number of American attorneys general who threatened to sue the companies. So the company backed off and they're going to refund the money, supposedly. But still, the truckers, the people for whom this money was intended, will not get it. So, in the absence of GoFundMe doing what it's supposed to do, others are filling the gap. An alternative crowdfunding website called Give Send Go has stepped up and raised already more than $5 million for the truckers. How long till they try to shut that down too?   Some Canadians are clearly worried about that. They're turning to cryptocurrency. Tally Coin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses Bitcoin. It's not controlled by banks. That's the point. They're hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. Now, why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don't control crypto. Bitcoin goes from person A to person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two.   It's pretty appealing and you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge, in this country and in Canada, want to make the U.S. dollar irrelevant, they'll keep acting like this and soon, it will be.   Either way, it's becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold the technology has on our human rights is decentralization. That doesn't apply just to crowdfunding, but more than anything to communication. You can't organize if you can't talk to other people. So Facebook, for example, to shut down the ""Convoy to D.C. Group,"" which had amassed 134,000 followers in just two days. No one's allowed to promote the organization anymore. Facebook, all day today, has been suppressing positive articles about the truckers in Canada. Of course they are. That seems like a story, but our media have ignored it. Instead, everyone in New York and D.C. and Los Angeles is cheering on the national security state and its alliance with Silicon Valley as they come together to crush a human rights movement. It makes sense.  CNN REPORTER:   Those with the so-called Freedom Convoy say they're staying put until vaccine mandates are dropped, the masks come off and life returns to the way it was.    PROTESTER: This whole event has gone beyond just vaccines and it is now about the entire ordeal. PROTESTER: We're asking for our freedom.  That's all we want. So, they've been free, free to park big rigs right next to the prime minister's office, free to set up camp in front of the country's national parliament. Ottawa police say they have learned much in the past week, especially after reports of assaults, intimidation and allegations of hate speech and symbols.   SLOLY: This remains, as it was from the beginning, an increasingly volatile and increasingly dangerous demonstration.  CNN REPORTER :   and it is spreading like a contagion itself right across the country.    It's spreading like a contagion. Now, you knew that CNN was the praetorian guard for our ruling class. Did you know they serve the same role in Canada and what other countries? How much money to CNN take from the government of Canada? That'd be worth finding out.

The only people getting injured or have been injured so far are the protesters, the truckers.   ‘AUTHORITIES’ PANIC OVER COVID PROTESTS, DISSENT-HERE'S WHY   In Winnipeg on Friday, an anarchist called David Zegarac drove his jeep into four people who were protesting vaccine mandates. Zegarac didn't stop after hitting the people he fled. Police were legally arrested him. Of course, police are treating the incident like a hit and run. Nothing political. It's not domestic terrorism or anything. David Zegarac, his views, they agree with. He's a progressive, a true believer. How much is he a true believer?   If you look closely, you'll notice that Zegarac has his mask on driving alone in his car during the assault, prima facie evidence of mental illness, something you see in this country all the time, and it makes you wonder: if you're driving alone with a mask on, do you pose a danger to pedestrians? Entirely possible. Someone should fund a study on that. That seems like a big story, especially since it's happening just an hour from our own border, all of this.   The question is: How long before protests like this come here? Clearly, our media are worried about that. Watch the morning news anchors on MSNBC. They're deeply, deeply concerned about these uppity working-class people. Watch.  JOE SCARBOROUGH: Where were these protests when people were required to give their children five vaccines?  MIKE BRZEZINSKI: They were in the doctor's office getting vaccines.  SCARBOROUGH: They were in the doctor's office getting vaccines and they were making fun of left-wingers on the West Coast for being loopy anti-vaxxers. Now, they have met the enemy and the enemy, their enemy, is themselves because they've become what they hated. It's a cult.   So here you have Joe and Mika sneering from their studio in Florida at the freezing wage earners stuck outside in Ottawa in February because they want their human rights. Screw them! Well, Joe Scarborough say that to their faces? Probably not.   Scarborough's famously tough on young female employees. Some say he's an absolute killer in the office, but it's hard to imagine Scarborough talking like this if there was an actual Canadian trucker in the room. Truckers in this country are watching all of this, and you wonder: what do they think about it? What would happen if American truck drivers decided they'd had enough of people like Joe Scarborough and went on strike? What would happen then? Well, this country would stop immediately, no more deliveries of anything.   Over time that would mean starvation for people in the cities, but even in the short term, there would be profound suffering in this country. For example, and this is something that too few people outside of television even consider, the world's entire supply of Botox is manufactured on the west coast of Ireland. That's a long way from here. In fact, it's a 4,000 mile long supply chain from the Allergan plant in Westport, Ireland to Jupiter, Florida.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP      Now, people at MSNBC might not be aware of this, but our country has no domestic Botox production, along with vitamin C and antibiotics. It's one of the lifesaving pharmaceutical products we have recklessly offshored. So if the trucks stop delivering, the Botox stops coming and suddenly your morning television anchors are going to look like they're 58 years old, which actually they are.  Could that happen? Is it impossible? No, it's not impossible. The people in charge aren't really thinking this through. Most of the time, trends start the United States and they move north to Canada, but this time, the opposite could happen.  This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the February 7, 2022, edition of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Some liberal  media  outlets chose to focus on Republican criticism of Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams'  maskless  photo with a group of school children over the weekend as opposed to the controversial photo itself. Abrams  visited  Glenwood Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia, on Friday to read from her new children’s book. Decatur area schools require staff and students wear masks due to  COVID-19 . So when a photo of Abrams sitting and smiling among masked school children appeared on Twitter, she received  swift backlash . But some media outlets were quick to come to her defense, pivoting to the motives of her Republican rivals. ""GOP rivals seize on Stacey Abrams’s maskless classroom photo as her campaign calls criticism ‘silly,’"" a Monday morning Washington Post headline stated.  ""Nevertheless, her Republican opponents and conservative commentators seized on the image, pointing out what they characterized as the hypocrisy of a candidate being photographed without a mask despite supporting them in schools,"" the article read.  A Monday CNN article similarly said that Abrams’ political opponents ""seized the opportunity to pounce"" on the gubernatorial candidate.

But Murphy went on to say how ""ridiculous"" it was that Republicans were ""rushing in to pile on"" Abrams considering they've opposed mask mandates. Republicans argue that they are confronting Abrams not for going maskless, but for not following her own COVID rules. ""I don't want to see an adult in an elementary school without a mask on,"" Murphy said. ""At the same time, Republicans rushing in to pile on Stacey Abrams is a little ridiculous because Republicans in the state have pushed against mask mandates.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   A mom of two children in Bethel,  Connecticut , knows very well the struggles with  mask mandates  that many other  families  nationwide have experienced during the  COVID pandemic .  She has seen ""tons of rising anxiety"" in her own kids, she said, which she believes are the result of in-school mask mandates.  The Connecticut mandates were imposed by Democratic Gov.  Ned Lamont  and have been enforced in the public school system during the bulk of the pandemic. Alexis Telep, 36, who works in radiology (her husband, Michael, is in sales), described in a recent phone interview with Fox News Digital the struggles their son Michael, 6, and daughter Lyla, 3, have been having. ""It’s heartbreaking,"" Alexis Telep said. ""I have seen tons of rising anxiety in both my children due to constant masking."" Though both children are suffering, Telep said, it's the situation with young Michael — diagnosed with  autism , sensory processing disorder, claustrophobia, anxiety and ADHD — that's particularly vexing.     
      Michael, 6, attends full-day kindergarten in Connecticut; state mandates currently require all public schoolchildren to be masked during the day. Lyla, 3, goes to private day care. Both kids have exhibited ""rising anxiety"" over the constant masking, mom Alexis Telep told Fox News Digital. 
       (Alexis Telep) The school mask mandate has been controversial — a group of parents even sued the state of Connecticut, claiming the governor's mandate was unconstitutional, as Fox61 reported in early February. A state court upheld the mandate; there's an appeal before the state Supreme Court.  Gov. Lamont's executive order on masks is set to expire Feb. 15, but the governor on Monday, Feb. 7, recommended the statewide school mask mandate come to an end on Feb. 28,  Fox61  noted. State officials will give the decision about mask wearing in schools to local municipal and school officials, the outlet also said. While all of this plays out, one American family continues to experience its own very personal difficulties. 3-year-old is fearful, anxious Three-year-old Lyla attends private day care four days a week. Alexis Telep says her daughter has developed a ""constant cough"" that she believes began when the mask mandates started. (There is no independent evidence that the masking caused the child's cough.) ""Her teachers tell her she spits germs at everybody without the mask on,"" Telep said. ""So she comes home and doesn’t want to take the mask off.""  The girl ""even wears it to bed, for fear of making someone else sick.""  NJ MOM, FORCED TO GET VACCINE BEFORE FAMILY WEDDING, WINDS UP IN ER Telep said her daughter, as a result of all the masking, now considers herself ""a walking germ.""  The mom finds her daughter's anxiety ""just so sad,"" she told Fox News Digital.  6-year-old feels ‘trapped'  Son Michael has a full-day kindergarten schedule. Telep called her boy ""a gentle soul — he’s like a little old man in a young body.""  She said Michael has been in regular therapy ever since his diagnosis of autism at 18 months old. Before the mask mandates, Alexis Telep said her son's disabilities were ""manageable""; she believes he was actually doing quite well.      
      The Telep family of Connecticut. Young Michael ""basically tries to bolt away from the mask,"" said the children's mom, Alexis.
       (Alexis Telep) That all changed when Connecticut ordered that schoolchildren had to be masked during the day. (Fifteen states plus D.C. have had mandatory masking for students, according to Education Week. Also, both the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics support the masking of all kids over age 2, as  Fox News Digital  reported earlier.) Given his sensory processing disorder, Telep said it's extremely hard for her son to wear anything on his face for any length of time. It causes an increase in his behaviors, she said. ""He basically tries to bolt away from the mask,"" she said. Michael began to seem ""closed off"" after all his mask struggles, she said. He wasn’t as social anymore. ""He was lost in his own world,"" she said.  NC VETERAN CAN'T GET KIDNEY TRANSPLANT BECAUSE HE'S UNVACCINATED When she reached out to an ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) therapist about the issue, Telep said the therapist told her Michael was ""trapped in his own mind, because he was so sad and anxious.""  To add to the family's challenges, they lost their pediatrician around this time. ""We were removed from the practice because Michael had a meltdown and they wouldn’t let him in [the office or exam room] without a mask,"" she said.  ""We now have a new pediatrician and we love her,"" Telep added. ""She is pro-choice on masks."" Exemption denied The Teleps reached out to Dr. Christine Carver, Bethel Public Schools superintendent, to try to obtain a mask exemption for their son during the school day.  But the superintendent denied an exemption, they said, even after they submitted a form their pediatrician filled out — something they said the school requested.      
      Michael and Alexis Telep. When they visited their son's school recently, they said, he was wearing a mask. They're determined to keep fighting for both their children's mental and physical well-being and safety. 
       (Alexis Telep) Devastated by the decision, the family said they consulted a disability lawyer, noting the governor’s masking order states that school administrators  may   exempt students from masks when they're unable to tolerate mask-wearing due to disabilities. The family is still considering their options with respect to any legal action.  Superintendent Carver, in a phone interview with Fox News Digital, said the school has worked extensively with the boy and his family.  ""The special education team has worked incredibly closely with Michael, to get him toward being [mask] compliant,"" Carver said when Fox News Digital reached her for comment.

But Telep said when she and her husband recently visited the school, their son was wearing a mask.  Telep also said that Michael sits alone at a desk and isn’t much involved in classroom group activities because he won’t wear a mask. ""He comes home and he’s upset, and he just shuts down."" ""He comes home [from kindergarten] and he’s upset, and he just shuts down.""   — Alexis Telep about her son, Michael, 6, who has to wear a mask in school Superintendent Carver shared other thoughts.  Regarding Michael’s in-class isolation — and whether or not this has been done for social distancing purposes — Carver said, ""I don’t think this is the case at all now, but initially the guidelines were [to keep] six feet away, for safety."" Should the mask mandates continue in their state, the Teleps said they may consider other schooling options for their children.  But in the meantime, they're determined to stand up for their kids' mental and physical well-being and safety.

CNN medical analyst supports Democrat-led states dropping school mask mandates: 'The science has changed',Brandon Gillespie," February 8, 2022 12:01pm EST","  close     Video   CNN medical analyst changes tune on COVID restrictions: 'The science has changed'   CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen claims ‘the science has changed’ as Democratic states begin lifting school mask mandates.  NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen appears to have changed her tune when it comes to the implementation of government imposed restrictions related to the  coronavirus pandemic . During a Monday appearance on ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" the former Planned Parenthood president argued that ""the science has changed"" surrounding the pandemic, leading her to support the reduction and elimination of restrictions despite previously advocating for some that critics felt were unnecessary or excessive. Her commentary coincided with several Democrat-led states ending state-wide school mask mandates in recent days, including New Jersey and Connecticut.

But when they were put in, it was always with the understanding that they would be removed as soon as we can. And, in this case, circumstances have changed. Case counts are declining. Also, the science has changed,"" Wen told host John Berman after he asked her to respond to states  lifting  their school mask rules. Wen said that data showed individuals who were  vaccinated  were well protected against the omicron variant of the virus, the most dominant variant in the U.S., and that people who chose to wear a high-quality mask were also receiving additional protection even if the people around them were not wearing masks. ""And so, in this case, I'm not saying – I don’t think anyone, really, is saying – that no one should ever wear masks, rather that the responsibility should shift from a government mandate imposed from the state or the local district of the school … it should shift to an individual responsibility by the family, who can still decide that their child can wear a mask if needed,"" she added.  Wen came under fire for the remarks from those who have long opposed coronavirus restrictions, particularly against students who have been at an extremely low risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes throughout the pandemic. Wen's statements on masks ran in stark contrast to  her views last fall  when she said the country was ""nowhere near"" ready to start lifting mask regulations in schools until all children were vaccinated and other external measures were in place. Throughout the pandemic, however, children She  also suggested  at the time that life should be ""hard"" for Americans who were not vaccinated, and that those who refused to get the shots should face weekly testing. She has, however, consistently maintained that masks serve as a ""very powerful layer of protection.""

""But we should also be intellectually honest and say that masking has had a cost, especially for the youngest learners, people with English as a second language, children with learning disabilities. There has been a cost to them. So the risk-benefit calculation has really changed,"" she said.

And so, I really believe that they need to be changing their guidance,"" Wen said. ""We need to hear their leadership here. The CDC has already lost a lot of trust and credibility.

   Ever since this show began in the early 70s as a summer replacement for The Brady Bunch, we were on top of one trend: Cancel culture.  The idea being, if your past isn't adaptable to current standards, you would lose your friends, social status, Netflix password and career. You'd be shunned from polite society.  Its kindred spirit was wokeism, political correctness on more steroids than Lance Armstrong, which allowed no forgiveness relating not just to your past actions, but to who you are.  Generally, it's things that can't be changed, like your race or Pete Davidson's bedsheets. WOKE IDEOLOGY IS ‘CRUEL,’ ‘EVIL,’ AND WON'T END WELL: VICTOR DAVIS HANSON In the world of the woke, you're either oppressed or the oppressor, and the offenses only flow in one direction.  Suddenly, we no longer measure anyone by achievement, but by victim status, which creates a new kind of segregation that's now spreading like omicron in the Olympic Village.  I call it idea segregation, IN that we cannot share our knowledge, wisdom or ideas if we're not of the same tribe.    Video Now we see this with  crime . This show has been blaring about rising crime, like the alarm at a broken Nordstrom's window, but the people who need to hear it won't listen because it's coming from us. It's the Fox crying wolf.  They'd rather drown in raw sewage than grab a life preserver from us meetings. And I get it.  It affects all issues, from the border to crime to  COVID . It's a division of ideas, and none shall mix.  Now, imagine if this kind of thing existed before we had a chance to make things.  Did you ever wonder about how a pencil is made? Milton Friedman has. I certainly hope we have some grainy footage of him lying around.  MILTON FREEDMAN: The wood from which it's made, for all I know, comes from a tree that was cut down on the state of Washington. To cut down that tree, it took a saw. To make the saw, it took steel. To make steel, it took iron ore. This black center, we call it lead, but it's really graphite, compressed graphite. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think it comes from some mines in South America. This red top up here, the eraser, a bit of rubber, probably comes from Malaya, where the Rubber Tree isn't even native. It was imported from South America by some businessmen with the help of the British government. This brass feral, I haven't the slightest idea where it came from or the yellow paint or the paint and made the black lines or the glue that holds it together. Literally thousands of people cooperated to make this pencil.  Someone likes his weed.  So the moral is obvious. It's not like one person sits in a room and makes a pencil.  As the lady in the pantsuit once said, it takes a village.  Now you can use that pencil to write whatever you want, or to gouge your eyes out if you're watching "" The View .""  But this is the case for everything we use today. It's the division of  l abor, which is not referring to twins being born more than 30 minutes apart, Cat.  This clipboard right here. The chair I'm in, Cat's hair extensions. They all likely weren't made by a single entity, but cooperation of sources, workers, ideas and, of course, labor from people who never even met each other.  MARCO RUBIO: SOCIALISM IS ABOUT POWER AND CONTROL I wish that was how this show was produced.  Imagine if wokeism existed before the pencil was made.  Could the division of labor exist? Think of the micro and macro aggressions. Why does the pencil have to be yellow? Why isn't it black? Are you Black? Do you have enough transgendered persons of color making the erasers? What's with the lead? Talk about a carbon footprint. And why #2, why can't they all be equal?  The fact is, nothing would happen because wokeism prevents the cooperation needed for any shared labor. It wouldn't just be pencils, but everything you use. You have to work together, whether you like it or not. And sometimes, you know, we have no choice.    Video Take the Alec Baldwin tragedy, if there was an idea, segregation, that woman could be alive today because there would have been an NRA instructor on set, and that's cooperation, idea-sharing.  Sure. Baldwin, a Democrat, might not like the instructor's politics, but he's not there for that. He's there to share his safety expertise.  And, an NRA dude would have kept a loaded gun out of Baldwin's hands.  Idea segregation prevents that. Wokeism demands you can't benefit from a person's expertise if they're not like you.  JAMES CARVILLE: I WANT TO PUNCH ‘PIECE OF S--T’ UNVACCINATED PEOPLE IN THE FACE The political is now personal. Sure, you're having engine problems with your car, and your brother-in-law is a great mechanic, but he's got a ""Back the Blue"" sticker on his truck. Screw it, you'll just walk home.  So now to Joe Rogan, there's likely no person on Earth who's doing more to dismantle idea segregation than him.  The roster of his guests are more diverse than the Olympic opening ceremonies, and they're allowed to speak endlessly about whatever so the listener can decide.  It's the antidote to cable TV, where shows rely on the same people who say the same things over and over again.  I mean, look at this show. You get 42 minutes of content divided by five segments and five talking heads. No wonder I'm on drugs, and no wonder CNN hates Rogan.  He's widening the universe as they shrink it. At first, the legacy media tried to take him down with his COVID content. He had doctors on who disagreed with Fauci, the left's patron saint of masks, mandates and mind control.    Video But the takedown didn't take. So now some mysterious group released a supercut of Joe saying the N-word over a decade or so.  Probably matching what previous Democrat senators and presidents would say in one afternoon.  The fact that the montage was released after Spotify stuck with Rogen tells you it's less about the world and more about canning Joe.  He's apologized, sincerely.  But we all know, like me watching the first Magic Mike movie, that will never be enough. The N-word is being used as a tool. They're getting desperate. They want Rogen destroyed. I wonder what the Angry Black Male has to say. TYRUS, ANGRY BLACK MALE: Greg, thank you for this time. This is not going to be your normal, everyday Angry Black Man. Oh, and I'm angry, but not for the reasons you might think. Yup. Joe Rogan said the N-word. Hell, he even said it with a hard-ass-R.

But us Blacks, we understand the word context. Joe Rogan should keep that word out his mouth. Hell, everyone should. He said it then. But you're saying it now, for no other reason than to cancel a man you can't compete with. And you know what? That sounds racist to me, because that's usually when I was called it. I was winning the argument. So you had to pull that out of your bag of tricks because you couldn't compete.  I think you just told on your woke selves.

   After GoFundMe shut down fundraising for the  Canadian  ""Freedom Convoy,"" donors flocked to Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo to support truckers protesting vaccine mandates in Ottawa. The founder and CFO of the platform, Jacob Wells, is now calling out GoFundMe and Big Tech for their ""authoritarian style of social platforms,"" which he says promote bias as fact and causes further division.   The campaign ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" has raised nearly $5 million through GiveSendGo as of Monday.  ALASKA ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ HELD IN SUPPORT OF CANADIAN TRUCKERS' ANTI-MANDATE PROTESTS  ""Big Tech really has taken it upon themselves to be the arbiters of truth. And it's a place that they were never intended to be, and it's caused more damage than good,"" Wells told Fox News Digital  in a phone interview Monday. ""We are now stepping into that place because there is a natural pushback from many people because America was founded on these ideas of freedom.""

GiveSendGo, which launched in 2014, permitted donations for Kyle Rittenhouse’s defense. The fundraiser allowed him to post $2 million bail after GoFundMe had blocked donations. GoFundMe lifted its ban on fundraisers for Rittenhouse following the teenager’s acquittal in November. ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" is the platform's largest fundraiser to date, Wells said.  His remarks come as Ottawa police have been turning up on the heat on demonstrators, making several arrests, ticketing about 500 people and threatening charges for anyone caught providing fuel to truckers. After convincing GoFundMe to shut down the convoy’s campaign last week, Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly  warned those financially supporting protesters  that police will ""continue to go after the money.""  So far, Ottawa police have opened 60 criminal investigations related to the demonstrations, primarily for mischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage.

""And it's the government's place to ensure security of those rights not to try to take them from us."" As a military veteran, Wells said governments are making a ""mockery"" of the sacrifices service men and women have made to preserve freedoms by enforcing coronavirus-related mandates. ""I'm a military veteran and I just I know what that sacrifice is, and I'm not going to walk on that lightly,"" Wells said. ""Literally, men and women have given up their lives, their security, they give up their safety and leave everything on the line to see freedom exist in this country and to walk on that to say, ‘Well, I'm going to take that from you.’ That’s such a mockery of those sacrifices.""

FEBRUARY IS AMERICAN HEART MONTH: WHAT TO KNOW ""I don't know how much we can really blame COVID, or how much of this is that we're just recognizing more of it,"" Dr. Noel Bairey Merz, director of the Barbra Streisand Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles,  told ""Good Morning America"" on Monday.  ""But, heart disease is the leading killer of women and all ages, including teenagers, midlife women and older women. This is just a component of that major killer.

The study suggested that the condition has become more common, with incidences rising since well before coronavirus swept the globe.  ""Although the global COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges and stressors for women, our research suggests the increase in Takotsubo diagnoses was rising well before the public health outbreak,"" Susan Cheng, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute and senior author of the study, said in a statement.

She was pushing the teachers union to reopen the schools. And she made the point that Black and Hispanic children in particular were at risk already before the pandemic, even more so since. And it doesn't take a study to understand this. I think any parent who has had kids who had to be away from school during the past two years understands it's incredibly difficult, even in a two-parent household, higher-income household where they've got laptops, they've got computers. Imagine how difficult it is where they don't have access to that technology. We are failing our kids in this country. Our children are falling behind. And sadly, it's been because of the political power of the massive teachers' union and radicals like Tony Fauci, who've kept our kids out of school.

""When we look at schools in fact that have masking there is less spread and there are in fact fewer school closures as a result of there being less spread of the infection.""

Video ""I think our goal should be – is to get to a place where we can pull back on these types of restrictions … as quickly as possible and as safely as possible,"" he said.

   Democratic gubernatorial candidate  Stacey Abrams  issued a mea culpa for appearing maskless at a  Georgia  elementary school, posing in photos where everyone but her was following local  COVID  protocols.  ""I took a picture and that was the mistake,"" Abrams told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday. ""Protocols matter and protecting our kids is the most important thing and anything that can be perceived as undermining. That is a mistake and I apologize.""

""Unfortunately, in Georgia, we're not at a place where that conversation is ready because we have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.""  ""I think each governor has to evaluate what's happening where they are, we have to look to the CDC.

""My responsibility, if I am lucky enough to be the next Governor of Georgia, is to look at the science, to follow the protocols and to set the right example.

The Democrat went on to say that the mask mandates ""make sense"" when teachers have limited resources to stop the spread of COVID, but stressed that despite ""that moment"" when she wasn't wearing a mask, the mask debate is ""complicated"" and it shouldn't be made about politics.  Abrams visited Glennwood Elementary School outside of  Atlanta  this past week to kick off the third annual African American read-in, where she met with young students and teachers.  The principal, Dr. Holly Brookins, took to Twitter after the visit to post four pictures on her Twitter account of Abrams' visit, which included three pictures of Abrams without a mask, despite the Decatur City Commission  reinstating  a mandatory masking ordinance last month.  ‘THE VIEW’ RIPS STACEY ABRAMS OVER MASKLESS PHOTO OP WITH SCHOOLCHILDREN: ‘STUPID THING TO DO’ The picture that went viral was Abrams sitting on the floor with her legs crossed and smiling without a mask on while the dozens of children and adults behind her were all wearing masks.

       When asked if she believes it's time to lift school mask mandates as Democratic governors have announced this week, Abrams suggests now is not the time.
       (OutKick) Before the candidate issued an apology, her campaign released a defiant statement attacking Abrams' critics.  ""It is shameful that our opponents are using a Black History Month reading event for Georgia children as the impetus for a false political attack, and it is pitiful and predictable that our opponents continue to look for opportunities to distract from their failed records when it comes to protecting public health during the pandemic,"" the Abrams campaign said in a statement to Fox News.  CNN COMMENTATOR DEFENDS STACEY ABRAMS' MASKLESS CLASSROOM VISIT: IT'S A ‘NON-ISSUE’ Fox News pressed Abrams on if she has any regret over not wearing a mask, but responded: ""We will let our statement speak for itself.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Canadian truckers have been labeled everything from a ""cult"" to a ""threat to democracy"" for  protesting COVID vaccine mandates , but Freedom Convoy organizers and allies are tired of being painted as villains by the liberal media.  ""I’m downright disgusted by the press and the way they have covered the convoy,"" Ontario-based trucker Brigitte Belton told Fox News Digital.  MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough bluntly called it ""a cult"" and other liberal news outlets  didn’t bother to pay attention  to the story until they reported on sharp words from Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly, who has spoken out against the protestors. CNN’s Paula Newton echoed Sloly, who labeled the convoy a ""threat to democracy,"" and other reporters have focused on his comment that the convoy is a ""nationwide insurrection."" CANADIAN TRUCKERS SHUT DOWN BUSIEST BORDER CROSSING IN NORTH AMERICA: LIVE UPDATES The unvaccinated Belton, who helped organize the Freedom Convoy when Canadian vaccine mandates barred her from crossing the border in the United States, said coverage of the protest has been ""totally biased"" against the truckers.  ""Not only the American media, the Canadian media as well. They’re spinning their own narrative,"" Belton said. ""This isn’t a cult … The federal government, the city of Ottawa, all those organizations that are out to get us right now, maybe that’s the cult.""      
      Brigitte Belton helped organize the Canada Freedom Convoy. 
       (Brigitte Belton) Belton, who drives a 2015 Mack Pinnacle, said convoy protestors are simply hard-working people who want to get back to work. She has said she's not against the  vaccine , but questions the safety and effectiveness of it and feels people should be free to decide for themselves. Belton hopes to get back to work in the near future, but in the meantime, she’s sick of American media outlets like CNN repeating the anti-convoy rhetoric of Ottawa’s police chief. ""I think anybody that uses those statements from [Sloly] are supporting the slandering of good people. That’s what they’re doing. They’re slandering good people,"" Belton said. ""All we want is our freedom. Why is this a bad thing?""  American truckers have also dismissed the ""out of touch"" journalists. ""It seems like everything is a cult or an insurrection or an assault on democracy these days. I don’t understand how people fighting for their freedom can be an assault on democracy. These guys are so disconnected with the average guy,"" Maine Expedited Freight group driver Brian Ilsley told Fox News Digital.  Ilsley’s company does a lot of cross-border traffic, often hauling freshly cut lumber from Canada back to the United States. He says lumber prices will surge if Northern Maine-based truckers have difficulties crossing the border, but the cost of wood isn’t the only reason why he’s been an outspoken defender of the Freedom Convoy.  MEDIA OUTLETS CALL THE CANADA FREEDOM CONVOY PROTESTING VACCINE MANDATES 'INSURRECTION,' 'SEDITION' ""The guys that I see that come into the dock day in, and day out, they just want to make a living, so they can feed their families and go home,"" Ilsley said, adding that rhetoric from CNN and MSNBC has bothered him.  ""People in the liberal media, the guys that have that platform, the Scarboroughs, the CNN anchors, they never have to worry about this stuff because they’re already set and paid, they’re already part of the machine. They don’t have to worry if they’re going to make it to the next day with the paycheck they already have,"" Ilsley said. ""My guys have to worry, do they get to eat next week?""

       (Brian Ilsley ) The protests began in Vancouver on Jan. 23. Hundreds of big rig trucks traveled to Ottawa where they were joined by thousands of Canadians on Saturday in protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s coronavirus policies. As the convoy grew, more mainstream outlets expressed their disapproval and disgust over the protestors. On Monday, CNN’s John King quoted the Ottawa police chief calling the movement ""a nationwide insurrection driven by madness"" when Newton chimed in, noting the ""insurrection"" language was no doubt familiar to Americans, who have seen exhaustive media coverage of last year's Capitol riot.  ""And just think of the language. I know it sounds familiar to you. A threat to democracy. An insurrection, sedition. I want to be clear things have quieted down a bit, but that does not take away from the basic truck-in, right, the sit-in that’s going on right in front of the national parliament,"" Newton added. LAURA INGRAHAM REVEALS WHAT LESSONS THE US CAN LEARN FROM CANADA’S ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’   Fox News contributor Joe Concha blasted the CNN correspondent for using ""loaded words"" to describe the truckers.  ""It really is an exhibit of what CNN became during the Jeff Zucker era, a three-part process … You have a so-called objective journalist taking a partisan opinion and inject his or her opinion into that report and turn it around and present it as straight news,"" Concha said Tuesday on "" America’s Newsroom ."" ""Loaded words in that report, ‘sedition,’ insurrection,’ ‘threat to democracy,’"" Concha said. ""Over a protest. Did CNN use that kind of ridiculous rhetoric when describing what happened in Seattle during the summer of love in 2020 when literally a police station and several city blocks were taken over by left-wing activists?""  Concha said CNN’s report on the trucker resembled what he imagines Canadian ""state TV"" would look like.  ""It might as well be called CGNN, the Canadian Government News Network, at this point,"" Concha said.    Video CBS and NBC didn’t acknowledge the protest for the first two weeks, according to conservative watchdog  NewsBusters , while ABC has only spent 22 seconds on it during that time period. It has since been covered, but largely in a way that dismisses the trucker’s efforts. ABC’s Robin Roberts has called it the ""so-called Freedom Convoy,"" and other ABC reporters have focused on ""frustration"" from critics of the convoy.  Meanwhile, the Washington Post  published a piece  calling the convoy a ""stunt,"" mocking participants as Canada's version of America’s ""extremely angry men wearing camouflage or horned fur hats."" The Post previously published an opinion piece urging that ""Canada must confront the toxic ‘Freedom Convoy’ head-on."" Ilsley agrees with Concha and said members of the corporate media simply can’t relate to everyday struggles of truckers who often live paycheck to paycheck. CONCHA RIPS CNN FOR ‘RIDICULOUS RHETORIC’: MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED ‘CANADIAN GOVERNMENT NEWS NETWORK’   ""They don’t get it on a fundamental level. They don’t understand it. They’ll never really understand why these guys are doing it,"" he said. ""It’s not just our media, the Canadian media, for the most part, is absolutely trashing this thing."" Ilsley said most Canadian journalists live in a few densely populated, urban areas of the country, much like American national news outlets are concentrated in major cities. As a result, Ilsley feels Canadian journalists trying to relate to the Freedom Convoy is equivalent to a New York-based CNN reporter attempting to understand the heartland of America.

   Left-leaning news outlets were quick to criticize Gov.  Glenn Youngkin , R- Va ., in January when he enacted an executive order banning mask mandates in  schools  during his first week in office, but some of the same media have seemingly changed their tune or remained mum after Gov.  Phil Murphy , D-N.J., took a similar action. Youngkin announced his mask mandate ban in January along with other measures, including one that rescinded the  COVID-19  vaccine mandate for state employees. A Virginia judge recently  granted  a temporary restraining order allowing the mask mandate to resume. LIBERAL MEDIA SCOLDS YOUNGKIN FOR FULFILLING CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO END MASK MANDATES IN SCHOOLS Some media were up in arms over Youngkin's order, including one liberal pundit who predicted ""kids will die"" under the new order. ""Republicans love to say Youngkin is the example of a new Republican,"" CNN political pundit Joe Lockhart tweeted at the time. ""What does he do first. - encourages kids to go to school without a mask. Kids will die. See, same old Republican."" Raw Story reporter Matthew Chapman called the governor a ""clown."" ""Youngkin ran on letting people locally decide how their schools are run, and on week one he's strongarming a school district to try to kill its mask mandate,"" Chapman  wrote . ""This clown is everything we warned he would be.""

When Youngkin enacted his mask mandate decision, MSNBC tweeted, ""In his first 10 days, he's gone backwards toward Trump': Experts discuss Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin banning school districts from requiring masks.'"" But the outlet struck a different tone this week following Murphy's announcement, which didn't ban mask mandates but does lift the order statewide; local school boards can still choose to implement them. ""'This is the right step': New Jersey governor lifts mask mandate for schools and day cares starting March 7,"" MSNBC's tweet read Monday.

She also said she lives in ""a liberal area"" and would feel uncomfortable if it became known within her community that she'd spoken out on this issue. Gov.

Yet the state's mandate will remain in place for another month — until March 7, 2022. NC VETERAN CAN'T GET KIDNEY TRANSPLANT BECAUSE HE'S NOT VACCINATED The mom in New Jersey described a troubling scenario she and her family faced recently — one that still gets her upset and angry. She said her young son, whose speech is delayed, was receiving regular speech instruction from a therapy practice. His therapy started, coincidentally, around the beginning of  the COVID pandemic . At that time, he was not wearing a mask.   But then, because of state mask mandates as well as continuing concerns about COVID transmission and infection in early 2022 — and once a therapist in the practice became pregnant — the mom was told by email that her little boy, out of an abundance of caution, would have to start wearing a mask during his sessions.  ""All patients, they told me, had to begin wearing masks in order to receive treatment,"" the mom said.

       (iStock) Though the mom protested —  how could a three-year-old child be masked during speech therapy ? — she got nowhere, even after she escalated her concerns to the owner of the therapy services firm.  Again she was told that her son could no longer receive therapy at that location unless he was masked. She was told, ""If you don't put a mask on him, we can't provide services anymore."" So ""they kicked us out"" of that therapist's location, the mom said. She was shocked. She was also informed that if her son didn't or wouldn't comply with the new mask requirements — she had the option of driving him to a different therapist's location 45 minutes away within the same practice (for the same services).  CONNECTICUT FAMILY DESCRIBES ‘HEARTBREAKING’ IMPACT OF SCHOOL MASK MANDATES Different therapists in different locations had different masking policies, she was told. So maybe she'd have better luck somewhere else. ""But I was not going to do that,"" she told Fox News Digital about her reply to the firm. ""Really? Drive 45 minutes there and back with a three-year-old"" in the car, all because the practice had decided it wouldn't give speech therapy to a child who wasn't masked?  ""I did not want to go to another location within the practice,"" the mom said, adding that ""things got a little bit heated.""  She was told to ""push"" for her son to wear a mask during therapy — but she refused. ""I have put a mask on my child in other situations when I've had to,"" she said, ""but not for speech therapy for a three-year-old!""

   When  New York City’s   COVID-19  rates spiked last December due to the emerging omicron variant, humans weren’t the only  mammals  affected. The highly  infectious variant  also hit the white-tailed deer population on  Staten Island , the most suburban of the city’s five boroughs, according to a study led by  Penn State University   scientists . DENVER DROPPING MASK OR PROOF OF VACCINE REQUIREMENT: OMICRON HAS 'RUN OUT OF FUEL' The omicron variant  was detected in nasal swabs  from seven of 68 Staten Island deer tested between Dec. 13 and Jan. 31, according to the study, which was funded by the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. It was already known that deer can catch COVID-19, after earlier variants were found in white-tailed deer  in New York and several other states . But the Staten Island study is the first to find evidence of the omicron variant in deer or any wild animal population, Suresh Kuchipudi, a professor of  virology  at Penn State who led the research team,  said Tuesday .     
      FILE - A deer crosses Atlantic Drive inside the Gateway National Recreation Area - Sandy Hook, N.J., Jan. 3, 2019, in Highlands, N.J.  The highly infectious COVID-19 omicron variant was detected in New York’s Staten Island white-tailed deer population, that first got to the borough by swimming from New Jersey, according to city officials. 
       (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) ""This sort of opened up the possibility that, like the previous variants, omicron can and has spilled over into animals,"" Kuchipudi said. ""So therefore we need to continue to monitor."" Although omicron has been found to cause generally milder COVID-19 symptoms in humans than previous versions of the virus, scientists worry that  new variants could emerge  that make people sicker. CDC DIRECTOR: STUDIES YET TO SHOW BA.2 SUB-VARIANT EVADING CURRENT VACCINES MORE THAN OMICRON Kuchipudi said the spillover of omicron from humans to deer sparks fears that new and possibly  vaccine-resistant  mutations could evolve undetected in non-human hosts. ""The major concern is that when we let the virus circulate in any animal host, in addition to humans, the complexity of virus evolution becomes very, very difficult to assess and comprehend,"" he said. ""So the bigger question is, the unmonitored or unchecked transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in deer and potentially other animals could result in the emergence of completely novel variants that might potentially undermine the protection provided by the current vaccines.""   Video Kuchipudi also noted that one of the infected deer in the study had COVID-19 antibodies from a previous infection, an indication that deer, like humans, can experience breakthrough cases. The Staten Island deer study has not yet been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal but has been published as a pre-print because of the significance of the findings, Kuchipudi said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While humans travel to Staten Island by ferry or bridge, deer first got there by swimming from New Jersey, according to New York City officials. The animals have long caused problems for the borough’s motorists and gardeners. The city has contracted with wildlife management firm White Buffalo to control the deer population by performing vasectomies on the bucks. A spokesperson for the city Parks Department said the most recent estimate for Staten Island’s deer population is 1,616 animals — a 21% reduction since 2017.  "

   Sweden  has halted wide-scale testing for  COVID-19  even among people showing symptoms of an infection, putting an end to the mobile city-square tent sites, drive-in swab centers and home-delivered tests that became ubiquitous during the  pandemic  and provided essential data for tracking its spread. The move puts the Scandinavian nation at odds with most of  Europe , but some experts say it could become the norm as costly testing yields fewer benefits with the easily transmissible but milder omicron variant and as governments begin to consider treating COVID-19 like they do other endemic illnesses. ""We have reached a point where the cost and relevance of the testing is no longer justifiable."" Swedish Public Health Agency chief Karin Tegmark Wisell told the national broadcast SVT this week. ""If we were to have extensive testing adapted to everyone who has COVID-19, that would mean half a billion kronor a week (about $55 million) and 2 billion a month ($220 million),"" Tegmark Wisell added.

       (Johan Nilsson/TT via AP) SWEDEN JOINS OTHERS IN ANNOUNCING END OF VIRUS RESTRICTIONS Starting Wednesday, only health care and elderly care workers and the most vulnerable will be entitled to free PCR testing if they are symptomatic, while the rest of the population will simply be asked to stay home if they show symptoms that could be COVID-19. Antigen tests are readily available for purchase in supermarkets and pharmacies, but those results aren't reported to health authorities. Private health care providers can also perform tests and offer certificates for international travel, but the cost won't be reimbursed by the state or health insurance. High vaccination rates in Sweden are creating optimism among health officials and a late 2020 study released Tuesday showing antibodies present in 85% of samples. Dr. Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School in Britain, said that with a substantial percentage of people vaccinated, ""an informed, educated and knowledgeable population"" can be trusted to isolate if they show symptoms without the need for ""wholesale testing that is not going to be value for money."" ""Sweden is leading the way, and other nations will inevitably follow,"" Pankhania said. ""We don’t need extensive testing for the sake of testing, but we must look nevertheless in sensitive settings such as hospitals, nursing homes and other sensitive places where there are very vulnerable people."" SWEDEN DECLINES TO RECOMMEND VACCINATING KIDS UNDER 12: ‘WE DON’T SEE ANY CLEAR BENEFIT' In 2021, the region of Stockholm alone spent the equivalent of more than $320 million on PCR tests, money the government says could be better spent elsewhere. For most of the pandemic, Sweden stood out among European nations for its comparatively hands-off response. It never went into lockdown or closed businesses, largely relying instead on individual responsibility to control infections. While coronavirus deaths were high compared with other Nordic countries, they were lower than many other places in Europe that did implement lockdowns. Also Wednesday, the country scrapped as of midnight its limits on how many people may gather at events or in restaurants, vaccine certificates can no longer be required and reduced operating hours have been canceled for bars and eateries. Announcing the reopening last week, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said that ""the pandemic is not over but has entered a totally new phase,"" and while infection rates have risen, it is not overly burdening hospitals. That tracks with what's been happening in countries across Europe recently as authorities relax coronavirus restrictions that have dominated the continent for the past two years. Yet testing remains widespread on the continent, even for people showing no symptoms. Schoolchildren and teachers in Greece, for example, are required to test twice a week, and many countries still require a COVID-19 passport or a negative test to enter restaurants, cinemas and other indoor venues.

Even as it relaxed most of the remaining COVID-19 restrictions in late January, the government said testing remained a ""vital tool"" for exiting the pandemic and said infected people could end their isolation after just five days with two negative results on rapid tests over two consecutive days. The government has also made rapid tests freely available, including via home delivery, and encouraged people to test themselves before potentially risky gatherings, hoping that knowing their status will curb COVID-19 transmission. Some providers of private COVID-19 lab tests have seen a steep fall lately in the numbers of people seeking tests since British authorities dropped the requirement for vaccinated travelers to provide a negative test upon entering the country.

   It’s a statement that would have been unthinkable just a month ago, amid soaring  COVID-19  infection and death rates and overwhelmed hospitals amid the omnicron variant surge. But with new coronavirus cases plummeting the past couple of weeks, a growing number of states are moving to drop their masking and other COVID-19 restrictions. And on Wednesday, the chair of the  House Democrats  reelection arm called for a return to normalcy, following two years of lives being upended by the worst pandemic to sweep the globe in a century. FOX NEWS' HOWIE KURTZ ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS DROPPING MASK MANDATES In a tweet that lit up social media, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney wrote that ""Democrats' plan to fight COVID is working - cases are down & vaccines are widely available. Now, it's time to give people their lives back. With science as our guide, we're ready to start getting back to normal."" Maloney’s comments come in the same week that four Democratic governors announced that they would be ending statewide mask mandates in schools. And a couple of hours after his tweet , Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul  of New York officially lifted the statewide mask-or-vaccine requirement for indoor businesses. With COVID levels nosediving, and with just nine months to go until November’s  midterm elections,  when the Democrats will be defending their razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate, it appears a growing number of Democrats are joining the chorus of calls from Republicans that its time for the mandates and restrictions to end amid a return to normality and that Americans need to learn to live with the virus. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC The DCCC’s GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), described Maloney’s comments as a ""stunning reversal on mask mandates"" and quickly accused Democrats of changing their stance due to political considerations.  ""COVID has been a political exercise for Democrats from the outset. Voters aren’t going to forget that Democrats ignored science, caved to their radical base, and imposed unnecessary lockdowns and mandates on their constituents,"" NRCC spokesman Mike Berg claimed. DCCC spokesperson Chris Taylor fired back, arguing that ""Democrats delivered on our plan to crush COVID-19 so we can finally get back to normal. The party of drinking bleach and taking horse medicine to cure COVID doesn’t get to claim credit for this – House Republicans’ partisanship and conspiracy theories did nothing but prolong this pandemic.""

       (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week warned against lifting mask requirements as it pointed to the nation’s dropping – but still high rate – of new COVID infections. ""Now is not the moment,"" CDC chief Rochelle Walenksy told Reuters on Tuesday. ""I know people are interested in taking masks off. I too am interested, Walenksy said. ""Right now our CDC guidance has not changed.… We continue to endorse universal masking in schools. But there appears to an increasingly amplified message from many Democrats to President Biden that it’s time for his administration to chart a new path forward in dealing with the pandemic.

   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday that right now is not the time for state and local leaders to end COVID-19 restrictions. In an interview with WYPR, Walensky noted that while the agency is ""cautiously optimistic"" about case numbers and hospitalizations trending downward, there are still a significant number of cases and hospitalizations in comparison to other pandemic peaks. MORE STATES REPORT DROP IN COVID-19 CASES, HOSPITALIZATIONS ""We will continue to evaluate the science. But, right now, we still have about 290,000 cases every single day. And, our hospitalization rates now are higher than they even were at the peak of our delta surge. And so – in this moment – while we are looking ahead and planning ahead, we will continue to evaluate and follow the science. Our recommendations are consistent with encouraging students to wear well-fitting masks,"" she said. When asked about what she thinks about the approach to loosen restrictions when it seems warranted and reinstate them should the need arise, Walensky said it's something worth considering.

""What I would say is, we might disagree on the ‘when you can’ part. When we have a higher number of hospitalizations than we've had during prior peaks of surges, when we have more deaths today than we've had in the prior peak of delta, I guess at 300,000 cases a day, I would just say we're not quite there yet."" She echoed those comments in  a Tuesday interview with Reuters , saying ""now is not the moment"" to drop mask mandates.

CONNECTICUT MOM CALLS FOR END TO SCHOOL MASK MANDATES: 'OUR KIDS ARE FACELESS, STRIPPED OF BASIC HUMANITY' MIKE ROWE: I think Hans Christian Andersen answered the question perfectly. Many years ago, when he wrote a great fable called 'The Emperor's New Clothes,' when the emperor was convinced that his tailors had made him beautiful garments, when in fact they hadn't made him anything at all. He was naked, sitting on his chair, naked, being paraded down the street as throngs of thousands of people in the town came out and everybody applauded because nobody wanted to admit that the emperor was naked. So they all pretended he had these beautiful clothes on until a kid standing in the front row is looking around and he sees the naked emperor and he's like, Hey, man, that dude's naked. And once he said it, other kids said it, and then some adults said it, and then people began to nod. And then very quickly, it became clear that the emperor's new clothes didn't exist.  And so in some way, I think that's what we've been living through for the last couple of years. We've been asked to believe that which is unbelievable. We've been asked to lend credibility to that which is incredulous. We know it makes no sense to stand cheek to jowl in an airport or sit cheek to jowl on a plane and then stand six feet apart in an airport. We know it makes no sense to walk through a diner with the mask, only to take it off when you're seated. We know it makes no sense to cover a kid's face who's two years old or five years old or 15 years old, so they can go to school. We know it. And yet, for two years, very few people said anything. Well, now the kids spoke up and people are nodding their heads and we're coming out of our stupor. WATCH THE ‘KILMEADE SHOW’ DISCUSSION:   Video  "

       (Getty Images) Nowhere has the debate over masking appeared to be so acute than in schools. Health experts like former Acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser have  remarked  on how masking and school closures have negatively impacted children's growth and mental health. ""As a pediatrician, there are a couple of things that I keep in mind,"" he said. ""One is the desire to reduce as much as possible the burden from omicron. And thankfully, young children are at the lowest risk for severe infection for hospitalization and for death. They’re not at zero risk, but they’re at very low risk. But you have to balance the measures that we’re asking children and families to do to prevent omicron against some of those costs. And the costs are real.""   "

   PORT HURON, Mich. –  Canadian truckers  protesting at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, have caused a miles-long traffic jam at the Blue Water Bridge in  Port Huron, Michigan , where commercial traffic was rerouted when the Ambassador Bridge was closed to vehicles entering Canada. Truckers billing themselves the ""Freedom Convoy"" began blocking lanes Monday on the Canadian side of the Ambassador Bridge, which links Detroit to Windsor, causing a traffic jam that eventually led to the bridge closing down traffic to Canada.

But the excess traffic trying to cross that bridge has caused a new jam, with traffic backed up nearly nine miles on Interstate 94, leading up to the bridge in Port Huron. The Ambassador Bridge is typically the busiest crossing on the United States-Canada border, carrying  more than 8,000  commercial vehicles on weekdays and nearly 3 million per year. The bridge also carries  roughly 27%  of all trade between Canada and the United States.

The bottleneck has caused angst among Canadian authorities, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford calling the protest at the Ambassador Bridge an ""illegal occupation"" Wednesday. ""The Ambassador Bridge is one of the most vital trade corridors in our country,"" Ford  said in a statement . ""The damage this is causing to our economy, to people's jobs and their livelihoods is totally unacceptable. We cannot let this continue.""

   A significant uptick in  MIS-C  cases, a rare inflammatory condition that occurs in some  children  after a  COVID  infection, has been seen in the past three weeks at a pediatric hospital on Long Island,  New York , according to doctors who spoke with Fox News.   ""These are some of the sickest children I've seen in my career as a pediatric emergency medicine attending,"" Dr. Matthew Harris, M.D., a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, on Long Island, shared with Fox News.

       (Kenishirotie) ""We have had 14 cases in that time. Most have required the ICU. Most were not  vaccinated ,"" Dr. Matt Harris, who is also the Medical Director of the Northwell Health COVID-19 Vaccination Program.  Harris attributed the spike in MIS-C cases to the surge of positive cases of COVID-19 that occurred in December and January across the nation.    JOHN HOPKINS STUDY REIGNITES COVID LOCKDOWN DEBATE Harris, who also serves as the Medical Director at Northwell Health Emergency Preparedness, said these cases are likely the result of the Omicron infection, given the variant’s predominance during that period. The doctor described how the Omicron variant spread like wildfire through the community, affecting mostly unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals. Harris also said omicron appeared to be more infectious than the alpha and delta variants, and more pediatric cases were seen with omicron compared to the earlier strains.   Harris told Fox News ""I don't believe we can draw the conclusion that Omicron is more likely to cause MIS-C itself, but given how rampant infection with Omicron has been, the shear number of COVID-19 positive children was going to manifest with increased cases of MIS-C."" The pediatrician said this underscores the fact that COVID-19 is not a benign illness in the pediatric population.      
      Child patient receives artificial ventilation in hospital
       (herjua)  The Emergency Department physician told Fox News that at his tertiary  children's hospital ; they have seen 110 cases of MIS-C since the start of the pandemic. The children’s ages ranged from 6 months to 19 years, averaging 8-9 years old. Harris said of those cases, 50% (55 patients) required admission to the intensive care unit and a majority required hemodynamic support.   Thankfully, Harris said there had been no reported deaths in these cases from MIS-C.   ""Clinically, these children present with several days of fever, will typically have a rash, and often significant abdominal pain,"" Harris told Fox News. The pediatrician also said blood work revealed severe inflammation and the children often rapidly decompensated.   LIMITING SCREEN TIME IN INFANTS MAY DECREASE RISK OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER, STUDY FINDS Harris cautioned that parents should monitor children for a fever that lasts more than 3-4 days (without another obvious cause, such as strep infection, ear infections, or the flu), especially if they had COVID in the past several weeks or were exposed to a person infected with COVID during that period. The pediatrician said if a child does develop a rash, a prolonged fever, red/injected eyes, or abdominal pain, to get the child evaluated with their pediatrician or the pediatric emergency department.  MIS-C is typically treated with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins to help reduce the inflammatory response, Harris explained to Fox News. Harris also discussed the potential heart issues associated with such inflammation.

       (iStock) ""They often require cardiovascular support because MIS-C causes inflammation of the heart, called myocarditis,"" Harris told Fox News but did say most children do recover and few have long-term effects.   ""I am not aware of any fatalities from MIS-C, though nationwide there have been close to 900 pediatric deaths from COVID-19 infection,"" Harris told Fox News. He also stressed the importance of vaccines in reducing the risk of infection, which thereby reduces the risk for MIS-C.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   ""While MIS-C is still rare, these children get incredibly sick, and it is likely that more robust vaccination in those patients who were eligible may have mitigated this somewhat,"" Dr. Aaron Glatt, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America commented to Fox News about this report.  Glatt, an epidemiologist for Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital on Long Island, said there have been more pediatric hospitalizations with omicron than with prior variance strains.  Glatt told Fox in an interview, ""Children who are hospitalized because of COVID are frequently not vaccinated.

   It'd be pretty fascinating to see the  Democratic Party's  latest internal polling on  COVID  restrictions. We haven't seen it, but it must have been pretty awful, apocalyptic, because something spooked them bad.  Over the course of less than a week, the same people who have systematically turned America into a quarantine camp suddenly, out of nowhere, started calling in unison for medical freedom. Suddenly, they sounded like Bobby Kennedy Jr., pretty much all of them.  Even the whiny hypochondriacs at The Atlantic Magazine, those neurotic cat owners who've turned COVID hysteria into a  religion  are now calling for a total abandonment of all Coronavirus restrictions. ""Open everything. … The time to when pandemic restrictions is now."" Believe it or not, that was the headline on The Atlantic's website today. Amazing. So if even The Atlantic has given up on coronavirus restrictions, obviously the pandemic is over.  HOUSE DEMOCRATS REELECTION CHAIR CALLS FOR ROLLING BACK COVID RESTRICTIONS TO ‘GIVE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK’ You should know this virus was killed, not by science, but by the  midterm elections . It turns out the only real cure for COVID-19 is the political ambition of the Democratic Party. That's the panacea. And by the way, that's fine. We'll take it. Yes, every upside has a downside. It means that pasty NPR listeners are going to emerge from their apartment for the first time in two years will be loose on the streets. You're going to see them at Whole Foods again, shuffling along with their tote bags, looking bewildered and annoyed. That's bad, but it's still worth it. Anything to make the insanity go away, we're celebrating. But we're also looking forward.  And the question is, how do we guarantee that nothing like this ever happens again? How do we prevent future mass hysteria events in the  United States ? And the answer is very simple. You restore democracy. You give Americans a voice in the policies that affect their lives. That was the system that we had for a couple of hundred years, it was a pretty good system. We ought to go back to it.

And that's true of everything, every bad idea. If the  Congress  had to follow the Constitution and authorize our wars, we'd have fewer pointless wars. We definitely would not be moving toward war with  Russia  right now because the public doesn't support that, at all. So virtually every bad thing that has happened over the past two years, or ever, has been imposed by fiat, far outside the bounds of our constitutional democracy. In this case, governors and health authorities got emergency powers at the beginning of the pandemic. Do you remember? With those powers, they played God for two full years. In case you've forgotten what that was like, here it is: ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ PROTESTERS CAUSE MILES-LONG TRAFFIC JAM NEAR US-CANADA BORDER IN MICHIGAN LA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI, 2020: That is why tonight I am authorizing the city to shut off Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Service in the egregious cases in which houses, businesses and other venues are hosting unpermitted large gatherings.

And if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail. Period.   NPR MOCKED FOR ARTICLE ON ‘WHITE PRIVILEGE’ EMOJIS So they went full fascist immediately, and they weren't even competent fascists. These are some of the least impressive, least skilled, least accomplished, least intelligent people in our entire country. You wouldn't hire any of them to clean your gutters, and all of a sudden they had absolute power. So it's probably not too surprising that they went into directions no one could have anticipated. No singing under COVID, no dancing, no working, definitely no exercising. We're closing the gyms, in the name of public health. In fact, we're closing the oceans. In 2020, in a moment that should never be forgotten by the sane world, authorities in the state of California arrested a paddleboarder who was exercising by himself off the Malibu pier.  NBC 2020:  Across the coast in California, fines and handcuffs for bad behavior … One man arrested in Malibu for paddleboarding in the Pacific, while 22 sunset seekers in SoCal were cited for trespassing on closed beaches.   So everything about that is kind of stunning, less than two years later, even. But maybe the creepiest part of it is how nonchalantly the NBC newsman reported it like it's totally normal to drag paddleboarders away for swimming alone. Because if cops didn't vigorously police the Pacific Ocean, seagulls could spread disease. Apparently, that was the thinking or the lack of it.    Video So our  media , almost to a person, acted like the peasants they are, and they cheered on the strongman reflexively, because that's what peasants do. They cheer as the person oppressing them rides by on this horse. MSNBC excitedly reported on how police in New Jersey, this is very clever, used drones to spy on homeowners in their own backyards. MSNBC:  Elizabeth, New Jersey is now using drones to spread the lifesaving message.  DRONE:  You are not immune to this virus.  MSNBC:  The drones make it easier for police to see into certain areas where access by patrol cars is more difficult. That includes tight spaces between buildings, behind schools and in backyards.  So some robot is screaming at you as you're having a barbecue in your backyard, and MSNBC describes that as the ""lifesaving message."" Don't depend on these people to save you from tyranny. Of course, they'll be cheering it on. That very same month that MSNBC aired that unbelievable report, we decided to speak to the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy. Now, Phil Murphy is a not very bright finance hack who got rich. How do these people get rich, exactly? But in his case, thanks to the Wuhan Institute of Technology, suddenly  Phil Murphy  found himself king of the Garden State. So we asked his majesty Phil Murphy, where exactly did he get the right to suspend constitutional rights in New Jersey? And here's what he said.  TUCKER 2020:  The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans right, enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit, and to congregate together to assemble peacefully. By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?   MURPHY:  That's above my pay grade, Tucker. So I wasn't I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this. ""That's above my pay grade."" So King Murphy's got an IQ of about 70. How did that guy get to be governor? I mean, that's bad enough, but to give him absolute power? Let's go ahead and never do that again, under any circumstance.    Video Checks and balances exist for a reason. We saw this all over the country.  Governors  and local officials abusing their authority, very specifically, to stop Christians from attending church, to prevent people from worshiping their God, from exercising their  religion . And somehow, nobody noticed. But voters noticed. Last fall, Phil Murphy almost lost his job in New Jersey, which is axiomatically democratic, it's the most democratic state you can think of on the eastern seaboard. So Murphy seemed a little confused by this. ""My subjects don't like me, really? I had no idea.""  So he convened a focus group. Let's hire McKinsey to find out what's going on here. Well, according to New York Times, here's what his majesty Phil Murphy found, ""Across the board, voters shared frustrations over public health measures, a sense of pessimism about the future and a deep desire to return to some sense of normalcy."" And by normalcy, of course, they meant getting Phil Murphy's boot off their necks. So Murphy, as we said, seemed a little stunned by this. But he reacted. Because in the end, these people are very simple organisms. Politicians are. They're not complex, they're not ideological. They respond to what they have to do. To blunt stimuli.  BIDEN AT ODDS WITH GOVERNORS FROM BOTH PARTIES OVER SCHOOL MASK MANDATES So he recognizes the midterm elections are coming. So Phil Murphy, again, not a genius, lifted the state's mask mandates. And that's happening in a lot of different places, blue states. Governors in Connecticut, Oregon, Delaware, California, Illinois. They're all doing it. Even in  New York , where the ""Governor"" Kathy Hochul, - that's what we call an unelected leader whom not a single voter actually voted for - she reached the same conclusion. Kathy Hochul, the ""governor"" (you know, by the way, in a lot of places, you can be arrested for impersonating a public official, she's not the governor, she was never elected by anybody, and no one's arrested her) apparently has the power to lift the state's indoor mask mandate. So she's doing that. But she shouldn't imagine this is over. They still have power. They don't want to give it up. So the Health Department in New York is trying to expand the state's quarantine powers, just in case they ever have to put you in a camp. Kathy Hochul has decided not to lift the mask mandate for schools because, of course, the teachers' unions have more swap than parents do.  Meanwhile, the CDC still requires U.S. citizens to get a negative COVID test in order to return to their own country. So the CDC has the power to bar you from your own country? Really, where do they get that power? Anyone at the CDC elected? I don't think so. They are a bunch of incompetent public health administrators. Nor, by the way, has the Biden administration announced plans to lift the mask mandate on airplanes. Now, why would the Biden administration be in charge of that? Shouldn't Congress make that call? They're the ones who voted for that mandate. Oh, no, but they didn't. Congress never voted on that mandate. The agencies imposed it. You should know that mandate, by the way, does not apply to private jet service. Most people who fly private don't own the plane. They rent a plane from a jet company. And those companies don't have to comply with the mask mandate because Democratic donors fly on those planes, so they're exempt. The TSA, by the way, announced in August that the airline mask mandate would remain in place at least through March 18. Congress had no role in this.      
      A person holds a mask while walking outside in Philadelphia. 
       (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Congress voted to spend trillions of dollars on COVID relief, but nobody in the Congress ever voted on a mandate for masks on airplanes. Will we have it forever? I don't know. You've been taking your shoes off since Richard Reid tried to ignite his 20 years ago. No one ever voted on that, either. None of this is democracy. Not when they make you take your shoes off. Not when they make you cover your face. Those decisions are too important for you to weigh in on. It's not democracy.  NEW YORK TO LIFT INDOOR MASK MANDATE, BUT NOT FOR KIDS IN SCHOOLS So the pandemic is over, but people like Kathy Hochul still have emergency powers and school boards do, too. They're acting like they have complete power over your children. In Naperville, Illinois, a court just issued a restraining order against Governor Pritzker's statewide school mask mandate. The school board? Simply ignoring it. So on Monday, parents fought back.  PARENT:  Why? Why are you continuing to enforce a mandate that has been ruled null and void?  PARENT: This type of evil is exactly what the law was intending to constrain. You continue to perpetrate this evil. The judge's words, not mine.  PARENT: Where's our family choice? You want your kids to wear masks? Then give them masks. You want your kids to take their masks off? Then take their masks off. It really is that simple.  PARENT: You've hurt her so much with this. Everybody talks about, everybody's got to be safe. Everybody's got to have everything. And we've left so many children behind. // She was going to be able to see other kids smiles, that kids would be able to understand her and she would stop being picked on because they could not understand her through her mask because her speech has been delayed even more than her special needs. I will never forgive myself for not fighting more. I feel that I have failed her for not fighting more.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP They're doing to the school board what the truckers are doing to Justin Trudeau, and let's hope it has the same effect. Keep in mind they're in that meeting because the school board is ignoring a lawful court order, and of course, blowing off the parents they serve. Now the answer to all of this is really simple.

Democrats scramble to reverse course on COVID restrictions ahead of midterms,Jessica Chasmar," February 10, 2022 2:17am EST","  close     Video   Rep. Malliotakis slams NY Gov. Hochul’s end to mask mandates, except in schools: ‘Purely political’   Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., discusses Democrats’ decision to drop mask mandates around the country.  NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Democrats across the country are scrambling to reverse course on  COVID-19  restrictions as this year's  midterm  elections loom.  With the notable exception of the White House, Democrats at every level are signaling their support for returning to normal as polls show Americans are weary of coronavirus restrictions, which Republican states have largely done away with.  According to a  recent poll  by Monmouth University, 70% of Americans say it’s time for the country to move on from the pandemic, and a decreasing number of Americans support  COVID -related mandates. President  Biden’s  approval ratings on handling COVID, once a strength, are also now underwater, with 43% approving and 53% disapproving, according to the poll. HOUSE DEMOCRATS REELECTION CHAIR CALLS FOR ROLLING BACK COVID RESTRICTIONS TO ‘GIVE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK’ Biden has chosen to follow the lead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which still recommends universal masking indoors and in schools.  Blue defiance But with the midterms ahead, many Democrats who once led the way in issuing lockdown orders and mandates over the course of the pandemic are easing restrictions in their states in defiance of the administration. Numerous blue state governors this week have announced that they are rolling back coronavirus restrictions, and prominent congressional Democrats have also signaled their support for returning to normal.  New York  Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that her state will end its COVID-19 mandate requiring face coverings in most indoor public settings but will keep it for schools. Illinois announced the same.  Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said Wednesday his state will end its indoor vaccine-or-mask requirement this week, followed by the school mask mandate in March. Massachusetts, which is generally considered a blue state but has a centrist Republican governor, will end its school mask mandate at the end of the month.  Earlier this week, New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware all disclosed plans to join states that have lifted or never had mask requirements for their schools.  Swing states first Swing states like Michigan, Colorado and Pennsylvania were among the first Democrat-led states to loosen COVID-19 restrictions last year. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is up for reelection this year, implemented some of the strictest COVID-19 orders in the country in 2020, including banning travel between two residences and the selling of non-essential goods. She lifted most of her restrictions last summer and has since pushed vaccinations as the best way to slow the spread.  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is also up for reelection, has taken a similar approach and refused to implement any new mandates. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, who is unable to run again this year, leaving his seat up for grabs, said in December, ""Local municipalities, as you know, I think ought to be free to do with what they want,"" echoing what many Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been vilified for saying for the past two years. Less than a year ago, Biden said the lifting of mask mandates in Republican-led states amounted to  ""Neanderthal thinking.""

       (Associated Press) The movement to ""move on"" from the pandemic appears to have sped up in recent days as new coronavirus cases decrease following the omicron variant surge. Also expediting matters:  A new Johns Hopkins study  saying the lockdowns of 2020 did little to curb the COVID-19 death rate and a new guidance Friday by the CDC saying the popular cloth masks accepted by most mandates are the least effective in preventing the spread. Living with COVID New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who barely eked out a win in the reliably blue Garden State in November, was the first to lift his school mask mandate this week after the new CDC guidance, and Democratic governors in California, Delaware, Oregon, Connecticut and New York quickly followed course.  ""We are not going to manage COVID to zero,""  Murphy said Monday on Twitter . ""We have to learn how to live with COVID as we move from a pandemic to an endemic phase of this virus.""

""We are lifting DE's statewide mask mandate for indoor public settings at 8am on Friday, Feb 11,"" Delaware Gov.  John Carney tweeted  Monday.

""It’s about time to end the statewide school mask mandate and enable each local boards of education to decide what is best for their schools,"" Connecticut Gov.

Kathy Hochul , who is running to keep the governor's seat, said Wednesday, dropping her state’s ""mask or vax"" mandate for businesses. The Youngkin effect The shift in Democratic messaging surrounding the pandemic was buoyed in part by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s upset win in Virginia in November. Focus group findings by Third Way, a think tank aligned with Democrats, found that swing voters who voted for Youngkin over Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe were motivated by COVID-19 restrictions and school closures even more so than critical race theory being taught in the classroom,  NBC News reported . MSNBC, OTHERS HIT AS ‘HYPOCRITES’ FOR CONTRADICTORY COVERAGE ON YOUNGKIN, MURPHY MASK MANDATE ORDERS House Democrats'  reelection arm has picked up on this messaging ahead of the midterms, where Democrats face an uphill battle to hold onto their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate. ""Democrats' plan to fight COVID is working — cases are down & vaccines are widely available,"" Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,  tweeted Wednesday . ""Now, it's time to give people their lives back. With science as our guide, we're ready to start getting back to normal.""  ""People are ready to pivot"" from the pandemic, House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday .

   Several states announced Wednesday that they would ease  mask mandates  as the surge of the omicron variant of the  coronavirus  continues to show signs of slowing.  In  New York , where the variant of concern began infecting huge numbers in December, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state would end the mandate requiring face coverings in most indoor public settings.  Masking rules would be kept in place for  schools , and the governor said infection rates and hospitalizations have declined in the Empire State to a level where it is safe to rescind the Dec. 10 order. ""This fight is not over, we’re not surrendering. This is not disarmament,""  she told reporters , ""but again the trends are very, very positive."" Masks will still be required in some places in the state, including  health care facilities , types of shelters and public transit.  CDC DIRECTOR WALENSKY ON DROPPING COVID RESTRICTIONS: 'WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET' In the first week of March, the state will revisit whether to continue requiring masks in schools, Hochul said. Also on Wednesday,  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said  he would lift the state's requirement for wearing face coverings in most indoor spaces but that the mandate will stay in place for K-12 schools. Masks will no longer be required to enter restaurants, grocery stores or other indoor spaces in Illinois starting on Feb. 28. "" Vaccines  work. Masks work,"" the governor said at a news briefing. ""And, as a result of them and the tremendous commitment of our state’s residents, we are on track to come out on the other side of this latest COVID storm in better shape than even the doctors expected.""

In a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital, House Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said it was time for the White House to take a lead in planning for a future where COVID-19 is recognized as a common respiratory virus rather than an infection that can be ""beat"" – an assertion the president maintained during his campaign.

The lawmakers referenced a meta-analysis report written by three economists, including a professor at John Hopkins, that concluded lockdowns had little effect in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. The letter also noted the toll they believe that lockdowns and even mask mandates have taken on the public’s mental health. ""Government’s response to COVID-19 has led to significant economic and social disruptions,"" the lawmakers wrote.  ""So many Americans have lost their businesses and jobs, far too many children have been left behind in school. ""In 2021, drug overdose deaths increased 28 percent to over 100,000 and, notably, fentanyl overdose became the leading cause of death in 18- to 45-year-olds, followed by suicide,"" the letter continued.

The GOP lawmakers pointed to the widespread vaccination rate and the most recent trends reported during the omicron variant that showed despite the fact that the strain proved to be more highly transmissible, death and hospitalization rates have dropped. Becerra extended the public health emergency for another 90 days in January, meaning it is set to expire in April.

   LONDON –  British Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  announced new plans Wednesday to lift remaining  coronavirus  restrictions within weeks, making the U.K. one of several European countries in the process of significantly rolling back COVID-19 protocols. The changes will remove quarantine mandates for people who contract COVID-19 in  England. ""It is my expectation that we will be able to end the last domestic restrictions — including the legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive — a full month early,"" Johnson said.

   It’s been widely reported there is a shortage of teachers these days. But there’s a growing crisis of those who will lead them. School superintendents are leaving the profession in droves with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 departing this academic year, according to Ray & Associates consulting firm, which works with school boards to find candidates. There is no doubt  COVID-19 , mask mandates, virtual learning and more are contributing factors, but that isn’t the entire picture. ""Superintendents are spending a lot of time addressing socio-political concerns and not nearly the amount of time they want to spend on the development and the educational attainment of students,"" Michael Collins, president of Ray & Associates, told  Fox News . Another factor is once sleepy school board meetings have gotten heated in recent months as parents have grown more frustrated over COVID issues and about what is being taught in classrooms.

Carney had reinstated the mandate on January 11, according to Wilmington media, and will rescind it on February 11. ""[Y]ou might have noticed that suddenly, the Democratic governors in Connecticut,  New Jersey , Delaware, New York, even Illinois and Oregon, as they are rolling back all of their different restrictions -- are starting to sound just a little bit like ‘Clay and Buck’ or  Ron DeSantis  or voices for sanity in an insane world,"" Sexton said Thursday on his program.

Sexton asserted that Americans, however, have been looking at Florida's lack of restrictions and comparing them with how they have fared statistically throughout the pandemic. ""This is why, when people say, well, hold on a second, is it really safe? I don’t know, look at the state of Florida.

'The View' hosts' most blatant COVID misinformation and panic moments,David Rutz," February 11, 2022 2:01am EST","  close     Video   'The View's' Sunny Hostin drastically overstates percentage of COVID deaths among younger people   Co-host of ABC's ""The View"" Sunny Hostin drastically overstated the percentage of coronavirus deaths among younger people during a Tuesday discussion on the liberal daytime talk show over the lifting of mask mandates in schools.  NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   ABC daytime gabfest "" The View "" has produced plenty of melodramatic commentary, viral moments and occasional outright misinformation on the  COVID-19  pandemic. Here are 10 examples. 1. Sunny Hostin suggests ‘1 percent' of youths who get COVID-19 will die Co-host Sunny Hostin drastically overstated the percentage of coronavirus deaths among younger people during a Tuesday discussion on the liberal daytime talk show over the lifting of mask mandates in schools. Hostin said she didn't want her children to be part of the ""one percent"" of those who get intubated and die from COVID-19, but federal health data shows the risk of dying for those under 17 from COVID-19 is far less than that.     
      ""The View"" co-hosts, from left: Whoopi Goldberg, Sara Haines, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro.
       (The View  |  istock) ""You see, I don't want to take the chance with my kid. I don't want my kid to be part of the one percent that is intubated and dies because I don't give her a vaccine,"" she said, noting she had gotten her 15-year-old daughter  vaccinated  when the shots became available. According to the CDC there have been 770 deaths from the coronavirus in children up to age 17, through the end of January. There have been nearly 10 million known cases of the coronavirus in the same age group, making the death rate approximately 0.008%, with countless cases unreported. 2. Hostin defends Sotomayor's false claim Hostin went to bat for  Supreme Court  Justice  Sonia Sotomayor  after Sotomayor said during oral arguments last month that more than 100,000 children were in serious condition from COVID-19, claiming many were on ventilators. Hostin suggested that despite being nowhere close to the actual figure, Sotomayor was making a valid point about the rise in hospitalizations amid the omicron variant. While there were more children hospitalized then than at any point during the pandemic, according to the CDC, the seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was around 3,700 that week, according to the Washington Post . ""Well, first, I just want to re-frame this a little bit about Justice Sotomayor,"" Hostin said. ""Because while she may not be accurate for current hospitalizations in children, she is correct that we have more children in the hospital now, more than ever before.""     
      Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor is seen during a group photo session for the court, in Washington, April 23, 2021. 
       (Getty Images) Hostin didn't stop there. Looking at her notes, she said ""right now,"" there were 82,843 children sick with COVID-19. However, that  figure referred  to the total number of hospital admissions of children confirmed with COVID-19 since August 2020, according to a Washington Post fact-check. BILL MAHER SLAMS CANCEL CULTURE AFTER WHOOPI GOLDBERG, JEFF ZUCKER SCANDALS  Hostin went on to state more than 1,000 children had died of COVID; according to the CDC, the number as of February was 795 in the United States for those aged 0-17. That number accounts for less than 0.09 percent of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States, according to the CDC. ""That's a real thing and those are real numbers,"" Hostin said. 3. Sara Haines: Permanent indoor mask-wearing? Co-host Sara Haines remarked last month that part of the ""new normal"" in the COVID and post-COVID era could mean people engaging in permanent indoor mask-wearing. ""I may never ride a subway again without a mask. I may never go indoors to big crowds and ever feel comfortable without a mask, and that's up to me to do that,"" Haines said. On Twitter, after a news site clipped her remarks, Haines maintained she opposed shutdowns, school closures and mask mandates for future, less severe variants of the virus like omicron, given the availability of vaccines. 4. Whoopi Goldberg rips Bill Maher Co-host Whoopi Goldberg erupted on HBO  late-night  host Bill Maher last month after the comedian criticized the ""masked, paranoid world"" of people and governments still insisting on stringent coronavirus routines. Maher has been critical of how liberal media has reported on the virus and noted Democrats were more likely to believe severe COVID-19 outcomes would occur ""if they contract it.""   Video Goldberg lashed out at Maher, telling him to ""stay away from everybody"" if he decided he no longer wanted to follow any of the measures used to prevent spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, and argued he was forgetting that some at-risk people were still unable to get vaccinated. She at one point snapped, ""How dare you be so flippant?"" ""That’s not really funny to people who've lost their kids … or people who've lost family members or dear friends to this,"" Goldberg said. ""Nobody on the planet really wants to go through this. This is not something we’re doing because it’s, you know, sexually gratifying.""  ""If you're the one who’s not paying attention, and you’re coughing and sneezing … then stay out of the public, man,"" she added. ""Nobody wants this. I don’t want it. And I think he’s forgetting that people are still at risk who cannot get vaccinated … little kids under the age of five, or people with health conditions."" 5. Co-hosts exit before Kamala Harris interview  In one of the more bizarre moments in recent live television history, Hostin and co-host Ana Navarro  were informed  in the middle of a broadcast Sept. 24 that they had tested positive for COVID and needed to leave immediately. As Joy Behar was set to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris for her first live television interview since taking office, a producer told Navarro and Hostin to leave the stage. Behar revealed after a commercial break that the two had received positive coronavirus tests and had to leave as a precaution.  As the show scrambled to set up a video feed for Harris to be interviewed from backstage, remaining co-hosts Behar and Haines took audience questions for nearly the rest of the episode. The awkward television that ensued lit up social media, as the masked audience members were difficult to hear. The co-hosts crammed in a brief interview with Harris at the end of the program. ‘VIEW’ CO-HOST SUNNY HOSTIN CALLS ON ALLISON GOLLUST TO LEAVE CNN OVER ZUCKER RELATIONSHIP It was later revealed, however, that both Hostin and Navarro had received  false positive  results and never had COVID-19. Hostin was particularly upset by the spectacle, as both of her husband's parents died of COVID-19. In yet another example of melodramatic coronavirus commentary, Navarro said when she returned to the program she had feared for a moment she could ""wipe out"" Harris and her family because she had spent time with them earlier that day. 6. Hostin asks if Republicans 'want their voters to die' Hostin questioned Republicans’ strategy of opposing vaccine mandates, such as Florida Republican  Gov. Ron DeSantis.  Although DeSantis has  promoted vaccinations , Hostin suggested that politicians like him ""want their voters to die"" by not getting the vaccine. ""So the Republican strategy is to tell their constituency not to get the vaccine, so do they want their voters to die? Like, those are the people that are supporting the Republicans. That part I don’t understand,"" Hostin said in December. 7. Goldberg stunned by testing positive  Goldberg channeled the energy of many media liberals who were shocked they could still contract COVID-19 despite being vaccinated and engaging in precautionary measures. ""I left a couple of weeks ago, just before the break, because somebody I had been around tested positive for coronavirus, so I left. So I've been gone a long time, I feel,"" Goldberg said Jan. 5.     
      Whoopi Goldberg speaks at an event in New York City, June 26, 2019.
       (Reuters) ""And I was all excited and, you know, they have to test us, and so they sent people to test me, and they tested me, and it was like, ‘Oh no you’re not coming back. We’re not sending anybody to your house. You have corona.’ And it was like, wait what?"" she added.  ‘THE VIEW’S' WILDEST, MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS FROM 2021 Goldberg stated that her shock came from the fact that she was fully vaccinated, had received the vaccine booster shot and hadn't gone anywhere other than her house or ""done anything."" Goldberg returned to the show less than a week later. Vaccines have been highly effective in preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death from COVID-19, but it came as a shock to many when they were still contracting and transmitting the virus, even after getting boosters. 8. Hostin touts conspiracy theory about Ron DeSantis As the response to COVID-19 has been tied up with politics for the past two years, ""The View"" has gone to bat against some of its political foes over their handling of the situation, in particular Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. CONSERVATIVES ARGUE AGAINST WHOOPI GOLDBERG'S SUSPENSION BY ABC: ‘ILLIBERAL AND IMMORAL’ ""For those people that think Governor DeSantis, DeathSantis, is doing such a great job in Florida, well, he's not doing such a great job because there are allegations that he hid the death numbers. There are allegations – and now he doesn't want mask mandates,"" she said in August, according to NewsBusters. ""He's coming after Joe Biden, which is absolutely ridiculous. We know this is all political. He wants to run for president.""     
      ""The View"" co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Sara Haines, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro.
       (ABC News / Screenshot) Hostin appeared to be parroting  heavily disputed claims  by former Florida health department geographer Rebekah Jones that she was ordered to fudge COVID-19 data and was fired for refusing, as well as a widely  panned Yahoo story  that accused the state of undercounting deaths. Florida has the 18th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country during the pandemic. Mississippi has the worst, followed by Arizona, New Jersey, Alabama, Louisiana and New York, according to The New York Times.  9. Navarro frets over Stacey Abrams' maskless photo The hosts of ""The View"" were  sharply critical  of Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams this week after photos went viral of her maskless at a school, where children and adults around her were forced to wear masks. Usually admiring of the gubernatorial hopeful, the hosts said Abrams' action was ""hypocritical"" and a major unforced error. Navarro's critique came from a point of Abrams putting the children in danger, however, despite data consistently showing they are at scant risk of severe COVID outcomes, even if they aren't vaccinated. ""How could she not be much more careful in a room full of such small children?"" she asked. ""Stupid thing to do."" Much of the criticism of Abrams from the right stemmed from her not following protocols she insists children abide by, but Republicans have largely opposed school mask mandates as unnecessary and even harmful to youth development and mental health. Abrams continues to support them. 10. Tennis star scolded over vaccine stance Novak Djokovic, who is not  vaccinated  against COVID-19, was scolded by panelists on ABC’s ""The View"" last month after the top-ranked  tennis  star’s appeal against an Australian deportation order was dismissed, costing him a chance to play in the  Australian Open .  ""Here is the bottom line, people are not putting up with it. Countries are not putting up with it, because it means that every time you sneeze or talk, you are spreading more hassle for them. They’re trying to clean their country up. They’re trying to put everybody in a mask and here you come, and you think tennis needs you that badly? No, honey, no,"" Goldberg  said .  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The hosts also clashed with guest  Michele Tafoya , an NBC sportscaster who is vaccinated, last year when she expressed opposition to vaccine mandates. The hosts derided that stance as selfish. Fox News' Brandon Gillespie and Cortney O'Brien contributed to this report.  "

The picture immediately drew criticism from social media users,  according to PJ Media. Critics accused school officials of hypocrisy for enforcing mask mandates on children while posing without masks at meetings. Lunsford defended her actions on Twitter, claiming they were appropriate because she only took the mask off for 30 seconds. That explanation was not satisfactory for attorney Chad Hummel. Hummel is representing Calus in a police investigation into whether security acted inappropriately in removing Calus from the meeting.  MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, PHYSICIAN SAYS IT'S 'RIDICULOUS' TO ASSUME NEED FOR PERPETUAL MASKING ""Even if that’s true, which it certainly is not, they were there for two or three hours,"" Hummel said. ""But, even if what she says is true, that it’s 30 seconds, why does she get to make that judgment call? Because she thinks she knows better than everyone else, right?"" Hummel explained that he would likely not be able to walk into a school board meeting and explain that his mask is only off for 30 seconds or some other arbitrary length of time. ""These people are such hypocrites,"" Hummel said, adding that children are given ""no option"" and are ""brainwashed to the max."" Fox News reached out to the school and local officials who were photographed without masks and did not immediately receive a response.  The Webster County School District released a  statement  that appeared to place blame on Calus for not conducting himself in a ""civil manner."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    ""We strive to hold board of education meetings in public in order to inform the community of activities going on in our schools,"" the statement said. ""Those meetings can only occur when everyone in attendance acts in a civil manner.

This week, the Monroe County Council of School Superintendents wrote a letter to Governor Kathy Hochul advocating for guidance and guidelines regarding an exit strategy for masking and other mitigation strategies."" Hochul  announced  Wednesday, one day after Calus was yanked out of the school board meeting, that the state would be lifting its statewide indoor mask mandate with the exception of schools, child care centers, health care facilities, homeless shelters and corrections facilities.

""There’s a group of us parents that have realized over the course of the last two years how much control we don't have over our children as it relates to their education,"" Calus told Fox News.  ""It’s a scary thought that the state has more power and control over our kids than we do.

   Several Democrat-led states are finally scaling back on masking requirements, citing declining  COVID-19  case numbers for the changes rather than scientific evidence that they are not needed. In recent days,  New Jersey ,  New York , California, Connecticut, Oregon and Delaware have all announced new masking policies for at least some places or segments of the population. DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO REVERSE COURSE ON COVID RESTRICTIONS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS ""We felt with a four-week runway, based on our dropping in cases, hospitalizations, in-school transmission, increasing in vaccinations, God willing the under-5 kids being eligible sooner than later, a little bit warmer weather a month from now — that combination has allowed us to take this step,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told MSNBC earlier this week. Murphy is lifting his state’s mask mandate for schools and day cares effective March 7. ‘Dramatic decline’ Similarly,  Connecticut  is eliminating its statewide mandate by Feb. 28, leaving it up to local school officials to decide what is best for their students. Gov. Ned Lamont, like Murphy, also pointed to case numbers and vaccinations.

       (AP) ""Connecticut is seeing a dramatic decline in cases caused by the Omicron variant, and children over the age of 5 have had the ability to get vaccinated for more than three months now,"" Lamont said in a statement Monday. ""With this in mind, I think we are in a good position to phase out the requirement that masks be worn in all schools statewide and shift the determination on whether to require this to the local level.""   Video ‘Much better place’ In  Delaware , the statewide school mask mandate will expire at the end of March. For other indoor public places, masks will no longer be required as of Feb. 11.  ""We’re in a much better place than we were several weeks ago,"" Gov. John Carney tweeted before adding, ""We have the tools to keep ourselves and each other safe. Get vaccinated. Get your booster. That’s especially important for children, where we continue to see low rates of vaccination.""   Video Easing restrictions California  and New York are not lifting school mask mandates yet, but they are easing restrictions elsewhere. The Golden State is letting its indoor mask mandate expire next week for those who are vaccinated. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) pointed to lower rates of spread and hospitalizations since the height of the omicron variant, as well as the existence of pharmaceutical options.

""With things moving in the right direction, we are making responsible modifications to COVID-19 prevention measures, while also continuing to develop a longer-term action plan for the state."" Masks were ""effective"" in explaining why the school requirement remains in effect, the CDPH still maintained. ""California’s common sense policies like masking have resulted in some of the lowest COVID rates and closures,"" the agency told Fox News. ""Schools, unlike other settings do not have testing or vaccine verification requirements and as such, indoor masking remains an effective way to reduce spread.""   Video Downward trends New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also pointed to downward trends in cases, positivity rate, and hospitalizations in support of her decision to lift a mask mandate for indoor businesses.  ""This is trending in a very, very good direction,"" Hochul said at a Wednesday news briefing. When asked why high schools, where there are high levels of vaccinations, are being treated differently from businesses, Hochul said students are in ""a very concentrated setting"" without much freedom of movement, and ""adults can make their own decision."" The above states point to trends in infection rates and hospitalizations as well as the existence of vaccines and treatments, which have been in existence for months or longer. Fox News asked California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Delaware if their decisions were based on any new data. Only California responded, only to say that ""the state has experienced a 65% decrease in case rates,"" with no mention of data specifically dealing with masks.

States lift mask mandates for adults in bars and restaurants but still require kids at school to mask up,Paul Best," February 11, 2022 6:28am EST","  close     Video   New Jersey Governor to lift school mask mandate   'Fox & Friends Weekend' co-host Pete Hegseth joins 'Faulkner Focus' to discuss masks in schools and how this will play a role in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   New Yorkers  can now go to bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues without masks after the state lifted its mandate this week, but  students  are still forced to wear masks all day inside the classroom.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday that the state was still discussing the school mask mandate with education leaders and will reconsider the matter next month.  Adults in  California  will also be free to go maskless next week when the state's mandate expires, but the school mask mandate will stay in place.  Health  officials said they are working ""with education, public health and community leaders to update masking requirements at schools to adapt to changing conditions.""  Dr.  Dyan Hes , the founder and medical director of Gramercy Pediatrics in New York City, said it doesn't make sense that children are still forced to wear masks for several hours a day while adults can go maskless.  ""Kids are not the ones who are ending up in the hospital with COVID. It's the adults,"" Dr. Hes told Fox News Digital.  ""So if anything, you shouldn't make the kids wear the mask, you should make the adults wear the mask, because they're the ones who, if they get COVID, they're sicker,"" Dr. Hes said.

   After pumping trillions of dollars into the economy over the last year, the Biden Administration is reportedly coming back to Congress to demand even more money to deal with the president’s  COVID-19  crisis. Indeed, 2021 was a year defined by crisis. Inflation reached a forty-year high; the southern border experienced the biggest surge in illegal immigration in a generation; and now America under President Biden is facing a nationwide COVID testing shortage. MORE STATES REPORT DROP IN COVID-19 CASES, HOSPITALIZATIONS

Another 3,900 people are expected to die by month’s end, even as infections, hospitalizations and intensive care cases fell almost as fast as they had climbed during the omicron wave to eh pandemic.

       The President is desperately hoping that throwing more money at the problem will help clean up – or at least cover up – the mess he has created. But the truth is that this crisis is not about a lack of tax dollars at his disposal, but rather a lack of leadership in the White House, and Democrats’ fundamental dishonesty with the American people about how, when, and where their dollars have been spent to supposedly fight the virus. One would think more public COVID-19 tests would have been on the list for uses of tax dollars over the last year, but a bombshell was revealed during last month’s Senate hearing with senior White House health officials: the Biden Administration failed to place new orders for COVID-19 tests for the first nine months of the year – from January to September. Meanwhile, as millions of Americans wait in long lines to get tested, large organizations such as Google, the NBA, the NFL, and yes, even Congress, all receive free, on-demand tests.   Video That decision is indicative of how President Biden – with the backing of Democrats in Congress – has mismanaged and wasted American tax dollars on items having nothing to do with combatting COVID while creating one crisis after another for the American people. To see how, one simply has to follow the money. On his first day in office, President Biden froze billions of dollars in funding, that was appropriated by Congress, for construction of the border wall, setting off a chain reaction that has now resulted in the worst border crisis in over a generation. Over in Congress, just a couple of months later, Democrats, at the behest of President Biden, put their full energy into passing trillions of dollars in new spending – fueling an explosion in inflation that has driven up prices Americans are paying at the gas pump and grocery store. They passed President Biden’s $2 trillion Bailout Bill, claiming it was urgently needed for ""COVID relief.""    Video But the truth is that less than nine percent of that bill went to public health spending to combat COVID-19. A sizeable portion of the other 91 percent effectively became a slush fund for state and local governments – meaning millions of dollars are being wasted and misused to build parking lots in South Carolina, plant trees in New York, build golf courses and clubhouses, and even send Japanese citizens living in Japan and convicted prisoners, including the Boston Marathon Bomber, $1,400 stimulus checks. The list goes on.  But it was not just a rampant waste of taxpayer dollars. President Biden also diverted $850 million from COVID-19 testing, $151 million from building a supply chain for vaccines and therapeutics, and $850 million from replenishing the Strategic National Stockpile to instead pay for the housing of illegal immigrants at the border.   Video Along with the bare grocery store shelves where meat, bread, and vegetables used to be, millions of Americans are now competing to find at-home COVID-19 tests. Today’s COVID-19 testing crisis is just the latest in an endless parade of failures by the president. Yet despite such failures, the Biden Administration is now reportedly thinking of asking Congress for even more hard-earned taxpayer dollars under the guise of COVID-19. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It is ridiculous to think that Congress should go along with such a request. The Administration’s own trail of inflationary fueled spending over the last year has hardly emboldened Americans’ confidence that government is a good steward of their tax dollars. What’s worse, Congressional Democrats have been an enabling accomplice for the White House. For the last twelve months, Democrats in control of Congress, under President Biden’s direction, ignored, then dismissed, and are now trying to explain away the problems they allowed to fester.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Every attempt by House and Senate Republicans to ensure oversight over the Biden Administration’s supposed COVID-19 spending has been stymied or flat out ignored by the controlling party of Congress. But failing to answer simple questions as to how their last ""COVID-19"" spending binge has seemingly left our country less equipped to handle the virus, is the very reason not another dime of so-called ""COVID-relief"" dollars should be handed over to this White House, regardless of how noble the cause may sound.

   Several thousand  New York City  public workers could lose their jobs Friday if they don’t show they’ve complied with the city’s mandate requiring they receive at least two shots of the  COVID-19   vaccine . Though they represent about 1% of the 370,000-person city workforce, including teachers, firefighters and  police officers , the mass firings will mark a new line in the sand for the nation's largest city, which has imposed some of the most sweeping vaccine mandates in the country. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, speaking about the looming firings at a news conference last week, noted that city workers largely complied with the mandate. ""Living in a city as complex like this, there must be rules. We must follow them. The rule is to get vaccinated if you're a city employee. You have to follow that,"" the Democrat said.

New workers who started their jobs after Aug. 2 were likewise required to comply and show that they've received their shots. There were up to 4,000 workers who had failed to comply by the end of January, according to City Hall, but that number has dropped as more workers have started to comply or produce their vaccine cards since they were notified last week that they would be fired. City officials said they won't know exactly how many workers are fired until after the deadline passes. For most workers, that's the end of their workday on Friday. A coalition of unions representing different parts of the city workforce sued to block the mass firings. But a judge late Thursday afternoon ruled in favor of the city.

   World Health Organization (WHO)  official Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said earlier this week that the agency is tracking four  omicron sub-variants , including BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3.

CDC DIRECTOR: STUDIES YET TO SHOW BA.2 SUB-VARIANT EVADING CURRENT VACCINES, MORE THAN OMICRON ""Now, we already know that omicron has a growth advantage; it's more transmissible compared to other variants of concern and also has properties of immune escape,"" she said. ""But, we know some of the sub-lineages, BA.2, has a growth advantage even over BA.1.""  Van Kerkhove said that means that as the virus continues to circulate, there will be an increase in  BA.2 cases . ""For … everybody [who is] out there watching this, what is important for you to know is that this virus continues to be dangerous. This virus transmits very efficiently between people, but there's a lot that you can do,"" she said.  The WHO is working to increase  vaccination  coverage in all countries and do everything the agency can to support the reduction in transmission.  ""We will not be able to prevent all transmissions. That's not the goal. To prevent all infection and all transmission, that's not attainable at this point. But, we need to drive transmission down,"" Van Kerkhove continued. ""Because, if we don't, we will not only see more cases, more hospitalizations, more deaths, we will see more people suffering from post-COVID condition – long COVID – and we will see more opportunities for variants to emerge."" MASK MANDATES EASED ACROSS US AS COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS DROP BELOW 100,000 Additionally, she emphasized that there's no indication of a difference in the severity of infections caused by either sub-variant – though more research is being conducted. BA.1 is currently the dominant version of omicron worldwide, but the WHO has warned that BA.2 – which differs from BA.1 in some mutations, including in the spike protein – is increasing in many countries.  ""Investigations into the characteristics of BA.2, including immune escape properties and virulence, should be prioritized independently (and comparatively) to BA.1,""  the agency wrote on its website .   Video Most states in the U.S. have reported the presence of the sub-variant, which Van Kerkhove said has already been deemed a variant of concern.

And of course, we remember those who threatened medical professionals and teachers at local town halls and school meetings in various states.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Those on the right have said that Democratic states, governors and unions have forced masks upon our children. But as the mother of two school-age children, 13 and 14, I don’t understand all the hullabaloo. It is a mask. My children wear it, don’t complain and, although they would prefer not to wear it, don’t care.   There is also the issue of the immunocompromised, handicapped or disabled. Do we just expect those children to stay home because of those who consider masks too much of an imposition on their children’s freedoms?    Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   Sadly, politics has played a huge role in decisions made about the virus, masks, vaccinations and social distancing. Over 800,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. And even though only 910 children under 18 have died from this virus, as a parent (and a human) just one life lost is too much. Especially if that child is yours.   If we want this pandemic not to be political, then we need (both sides) to do away with the politics. Vaccinate. Be responsible. Don’t have huge gatherings. And when it comes to children, follow medical guidance and think about those who deal with much larger issues than having to wear a mask.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LESLIE MARSHALL  "

   Democratic senators  are urging the Biden administration to provide  COVID-19  boosters, as well as ""vaccine and booster education"" to illegal immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, amid fears of rising COVID-19 cases in detention centers. In a  letter  to acting ICE Director Tae Johnson sent this week, the Democrats cite statistics that the number of COVID-19 cases have increased by 800% since the start of the year and that at the end of January 14% of the detainee population (at least 3,038) were under isolation or monitoring for COVID-19. CBP SOUNDS ALARM ON CRIMINAL GANGS RECRUITING TEENS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO SMUGGLE MIGRANTS ""In spite of the CDC’s recommendations, ICE is failing to provide COVID-19 booster shots to people in ICE detention,"" the Democrats write. ""As of January 6, 2022, ICE has administered only 671 booster shots nationwide, to the over 22,000 detainees nationwide in ICE custody each day. Advocates have reported to us that booster shots are not being made available to individuals in detention and that even educational materials about booster shots are not uniformly available.""

So far the Biden administration has not issued any vaccine mandate for illegal immigrants who are in the country, although it has mandated them for travelers at ports of entry.

The protesters are decrying vaccine mandates for truckers and other COVID-19 restrictions and are railing against Trudeau, even though many of Canada’s precautions, such as mask rules and vaccine passports for getting into restaurants, theaters and other places, were enacted by provincial authorities, not the federal government, and are already rapidly being lifted as the omicron surge levels off. Trudeau continued to stand firm against lifting vaccine mandates, including a requirement that all truck drivers entering the country be fully vaccinated. But because an estimated 90% of the nation’s truckers are already inoculated, some conservatives have called on the prime minister to drop the mandate.

The cause has drawn international attention and support, with a U.S. trucker protest possibly  starting  this weekend in Los Angeles around the Super Bowl, the Department of Homeland Security announced.  In a statement  posted  to Facebook on Jan. 26, the Canadian truckers clearly stated their demands, which they tied to personal freedoms from government overreach: The truckers demanded in the letter that the Canadian government remove the vaccine mandates and to terminate any government-backed digital tracking platform such as the COVID-19 vaccine passport and contact tracing programs.

   Two healthy middle-aged  females  returned to almost their normal daily activities after taking daily antihistamines for long  COVID , according to a recently published case  report .   The  researchers  noted long COVID is a chronic condition when patients who are infected with the virus have persistent symptoms that extend beyond the typical time frame for the infection to resolve, but the illness currently doesn’t have any evidence-based treatments to guide how to manage it.    ""Most patients tell us that providers have not recommended anything that has helped,"" said co-author Melissa Pinto, associate professor at the University of California, Irvine Sue and Bill Gross School of Nursing.  The report describes the first case of a White woman in her 40s with a past medical history of  Raynaud's phenomenon  (a condition where there is decreased blood flow to the fingers),  polycystic ovarian syndrome  (a hormonal disorder of the ovaries), and a milk allergy.   She is likely one of the first known people to be infected with COVID-19 in the United States, according to  ScienceAlert .

   Shortly after the  coronavirus  outbreak, influential leaders in the science community huddled to say the deadly virus most likely originated naturally from an animal transfer to humans. New reporting from Fox News' ""Special Report"" showed there was an effort by   Dr. Anthony Fauci,  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, then-National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, and other scientists to not mention the possibility of the virus originating in a lab. The consensus was reached on a call in early 2020 that the lab leak theory should be left out of an  early paper   on COVID-19 origins because it will add "" fuel to the conspiracists."" Two years later, there is no definitive proof that the virus started in nature or that it leaked from a lab. But the theory that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses, is no longer shunned as a conspiracy and is gaining more traction among scientific communities  calling for further inquiry . FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN Fox News talked to several scientists and investigators who have studied COVID-19 origins, and here are some reasons – science-based and circumstantial – why they believe the evidence points to the global pandemic originating from a Wuhan lab, possibly from a researcher accidentally getting infected during an experiment with coronaviruses and spreading it into the community. ""When you evaluate the two theories, it is so overwhelmingly in favor of the lab leak that everything else is just incidental evidence about the details of what happened,"" said Richard Muller, emeritus professor of physics at the University of California Berkeley, who has been a strong advocate for the lab-leak theory. Scientists are not in agreement on the origins of the virus, while the U.S. intelligence community also could not draw conclusions on what started the global pandemic that has killed more than 5.7 million people worldwide.

       (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) 1) No animals have been found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 Under the natural origin theory, the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, would have originated in an animal and traveled to humans either directly or through an intermediate host animal.  This natural spillover has precedent. For example, researchers traced the first Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 back to  bat caves in China’s Yunnan  province, and the likely intermediary host animals were masked palm civets that tested positive for the virus.  The trouble with drawing the same conclusion for COVID-19 is that no one has identified an animal that has tested positive for the novel coronavirus that caused the global pandemic. It's not for a lack of trying. Investigators tested more than 80,000 animals in  China , including hundreds linked to the Huanan seafood market associated with the early cases of COVID-19, but ""no positive result was identified for SARS-CoV-2,"" the World Health Organization (WHO) study on the origins of COVID-19 says. RAND PAUL SEEKING ANSWERS ON COVID ORIGINS, GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH FROM 'CONVENTION OF CIVILIZED COUNTRIES' ""They tested an unprecedented 80,000 animals covering 209 species, including wild, domestic and market animals … and they found no infections in  animals ,"" Muller, the professor emeritus, told Fox News Digital.  ""They found nothing. But instead of drawing a scientific conclusion from that, the World Health Organization came up with excuses."" The controversial World Health Organization (WHO) study on the origins of COVID-19 says the most likely scenario was a transmission from bats to an unknown host animal to humans, while the lab leak is "" e xtremely unlikely.""  But even the  WHO has  backtracked  and admitted it was too quick to rule out the lab theory and has  revived  its investigation.

       (AP Photo/Kyle Green, File) 2) No evidence of pre-epidemic infections During past coronavirus epidemics, such as SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2013, there was evidence of extensive human infection from animals prior to the virus mutating to become transmissible between humans and sparking the pandemic, Muller said.  Investigators tested more than 9,000 human biological samples – including blood, plasma and throat swabs – that were stored at hospitals and blood banks prior to the pandemic, Muller said, citing data from the WHO report.  It was expected that between 100 and 400 would be positive for SARS-CoV-2, based on the natural outbreak experiences with SARS and MERS, Muller said. But in this case, zero tested positive. ""There is no evidence of multiple animal-to-human transmissions,"" said Dr. Steven Quay, a physician and founder of Atossa Therapeutics.  Muller and Quay have worked together on studying coronavirus origins and have  presented their findings to  Congress  and in a  Wall Street Journal op-ed . The lack of evidence of pre-pandemic infection and genetic purity of the virus suggests COVID-19 wasn’t a natural spillover from animals, but a lab-acquired infection, the scientists say.     
      There have been more than 900,000 people COVID-19 deaths in the United States.  
       (iStock) 3) The genetic fingerprint of the virus is so unique it has never been observed in a natural coronavirus  Quay, who is writing a book on why COVID-19 originated from a lab, said SARS-CoV-2 has a unique trigger on its surface called a furin cleavage site and a unique code in its genes for that site, called a CGG-CGG dimer. This combination has  never been found naturally  and therefore points to a lab-manipulated virus, he says. Since 1992, in gain-of-function research experiments, laboratories have inserted furin sites into viruses repeatedly, Quay said. The end result is supercharged, more infectious viruses, he said.  ""These gene jockeys have put in a furin site into a virus that didn't have one in the laboratory,"" Quay told Fox News Digital. ""Eleven out of 11 times it makes it more effective, more transmissible, more lethal -- all the bad things you'd want. So if you want to juice up a virus and make it more infective or make it go from bats to humans, putting in a furin cleavage site is a great idea."" Scientists are not in agreement that the CGG sequences in the furin cleavage site signify the virus was made in a lab. Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in California, said such arguments are "" factually incorrect .""   Video 4) The virus appeared in humans already ""optimized"" into an extremely contagious version Based on SARS1 and MERS experiences, when the virus becomes capable of human-to-human transmission, it takes weeks to evolve as it spreads through the population and the most contagious forms of the virus dominated. But with COVID-19, the virus was pre-adapted for human-to-human transmission from the first patient, Quay says. Specifically, he said, the part of the virus that interacts with human cells was 99.5% optimized.  ""Such early optimization is unprecedented, and it suggests a long period of adaptation that predated its public spread,"" Quay and Muller  wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal  about their findings. ""Science knows of only one way that could be achieved: simulated natural evolution, growing the virus on human cells until the optimum is achieved."" NIH ACKNOWLEDGES US FUNDED GAIN-OF-FUNCTION AT WUHAN LAB, DESPITE FAUCI’S DENIALS Quay believes the COVID-19 virus was taught to infect humans in the laboratory through gain-of-function research on ""humanized mice"" that are repeatedly exposed to the virus to encourage adaptation.  Other  studies  refute the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized for binding to human ACE2 upon its emergence.

       (REUTERS/Thomas Peter) 5) The Wuhan Institute of Virology studies bat coronaviruses and has engaged in ""gain-of-function"" research  The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China studies bat coronaviruses and their potential to infect humans. It has also engaged with so-called ""gain of function"" experiments,  according to the State Department , so it was natural to consider whether a bat-related coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan came from the lab. ""Every informed person, every person in the field of virology, every person in the field of biosafety and biosecurity in January was thinking lab release,"" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, told Fox News Digital. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is one of at most three places in the world that was conducting gain-of-function research and potential pandemic pathogen enhancement research on SARS-related coronaviruses prior to the pandemic, Ebright said. The other two are the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, he said.  Gain-of-function research involves extracting viruses from animals to artificially engineer in a laboratory to make them more transmissible and deadly to humans. The purpose of such research is to allow scientists to get ahead of the curve in developing treatments for certain infectious diseases. But such research is controversial – and was subject to a U.S. funding moratorium in 2014 under the Obama administration – over concerns the risks of creating more dangerous pathogens outweighed the benefit to prepare for future outbreaks. The federal funding ban was lifted in 2017 with new guidelines.  HOUSE REPUBLICANS PRESS USAID ON $4.7M GRANT FOR ECOHEALTH ALLIANCE AMID COVID QUESTIONS In one example of research, scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill teamed up for an experiment that created a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus related to the virus that causes SARS,  according to a paper  the scientists authored in 2015. The scientists  said in  2015  the work was underway before the ""gain of function"" moratorium began and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) later determined the research was not so risky as to fall under the ban. The scientists created a chimeric virus, made up of a surface protein of SHC014 virus found in horseshoe bats in China and the backbone of a SARS virus that had been adapted to grow in mice and to mimic human disease.  Ebright  raised alarms about this experiment  at the time and the risk of creating a new lab-made outbreak.  So when news of a COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan broke four years later, Ebright thought of that risky research in Wuhan that was already flagged as a potential pandemic threat. ""This was not merely a possibility,"" Ebright said of a lab leak. ""It had been predicted.""

And Shi Zhengli, who leads the Wuhan Institute of Virology research team on bat coronaviruses,  has said  the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus does not match any of the viruses her team had sampled from bat caves in China. But China  has stonewalled an independent investigation , failing to provide complete access or independence to investigators,  withholding data  on the earliest days of the outbreak. The WIV ""has not been transparent"" about its record of studying viruses most similar to the COVID-19 virus, including ""RaTG13,"" which it sampled from a cave in Yunnan Province in 2013 after several miners died of SARS-like illness,  according to the State Department .  The bat virus databases managed by the Wuhan Institute of Virology have  went offline , hidden from scrutiny. Meanwhile, the lab’s U.S. partner, EcoHealth Alliance, has been less than forthcoming about what was going on the Wuhan lab,  according to the NIH  and congressional investigators. EcoHealth Alliance has received $117 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars, including a $600,000 NIH grant to study the risk of bat coronavirus emergence that was then subgranted to the Wuhan lab, according to a House Republican aide involved in a congressional investigation on COVID-19 origins.  WAPO CALLS FOR ANSWERS ON WUHAN LAB RESEARCH AFTER CALLING PAST QUESTIONS 'FRINGE' THEORIES Even the Washington Post editorial board in October called for EcoHealth Alliance President  Peter Daszak  to testify before Congress about the origins of COVID-19, following revelations that, despite  repeated denials , the National Institutes of Health did fund so-called ""gain of function"" coronavirus research in Wuhan through Daszak's nonprofit. While China isn’t cooperating, investigators believe that the United States already has insight into the research activities at the Wuhan Institute of Virology through grant-making organizations and EcoHealth Alliance records, and argue those documents need to be made public.   Video 7) Lab leaks are not uncommon, so they should not have been dismissed so quickly at the onset of the pandemic Researchers working on viruses in laboratories have accidentally gotten infected before and caused virus outbreaks in China and elsewhere. For example, in 2004, a lab-leak SARS outbreak in Beijing infected nine people, killing the mother of an infected graduate student who worked at China's National Institute of Virology Laboratory. The lab was conducting research on SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).   In Taiwan in 2003, a scientist at the National Defense University in Taipei  became  infected  with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) after studying it in the lab. And a laboratory accident was also to blame for a  SARS infection in Singapore in 2003  when a doctoral student at the Singapore General Hospital got sick. STATE DEPARTMENT LEADERS WERE WARNED NOT TO PURSUE COVID ORIGIN INVESTIGATION: FORMER OFFICIAL S ""These viruses are always waiting to infect you,"" Quay said of lab research. ""You only have to make a mistake for five minutes after a 20-year career and, you know, you've got it.""   Video 8) Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were sick just prior to the community outbreak The State Department  revealed in January 2021  that the ""U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.""  ""This raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli’s public claim that there was ‘zero infection’ among the WIV’s staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses,"" according to the State Department report released in the final days of the Trump Administration.  A U.S. intelligence report  revealed by the Wall Street Journal  in May went into greater detail. It said that three of the researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were sick enough to seek hospital care in November 2019.

       (Amir Levy/Getty Images) 9) The Wuhan Institute of Virology has conducted ""secret"" research projects with the Chinese military  The U.S State Department revealed on Jan. 15, 2021, that the Wuhan Institute of Virology has collaborated on ""secret projects"" with China’s military and warned that the country has a history of biological weapons work that Beijing has not ""demonstrably eliminated."" ""The WIV has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017,"" the  State Department fact sheet states . ""The United States and other donors who funded or collaborated on civilian research at the WIV have a right and obligation to determine whether any of our research funding was diverted to secret Chinese military projects at the WIV."" Quay, who  testified during a congressional hearing , said the COVID-19 virus shows strong signs of academic gain-of-function research and ""hints"" of some never-seen-before features that would be more consistent with ""creating a bioweapon."" ""You cannot draw a conclusion of that magnitude without knowing the minds of the people,"" Quay told Fox News. ""The difference between academic research and a bioweapon is in the minds of the person in the lab."" Regardless, Quay believes any lab release was not purposeful. ""There’s abundant evidence that this was an accident.""   Video 10) There was an ""orchestrated effort"" by NIH officials and others to quickly shut down the lab-leak theory  Those who favor the lab-leak theory have been frustrated by leaders at the National Institutes of Health, including Fauci, who pushed the natural origin theory from the early days of the pandemic and repeatedly denied that the federal agency was funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Newly released documents showed that Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was warned early on that the virus may have originated in the Wuhan lab. On January 31, 2020, Dr. Kristian Andersen, a noted virologist at the Scripps Lab, privately told Fauci that after discussion with his colleagues some of COVID-19’s features look possibly engineered and the ""genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory."" In response, Fauci hastily organized a call with dozens of worldwide virologists, and notes from the meeting  obtained by Fox News’ ""Special Report""  reveal that suspicions of the lab leak theory were suppressed over concerns of how the public would react to news of possible Chinese government involvement.  Andersen went on to write a very influential paper with other virologists in Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020, that said just the opposite of his initial concerns about a lab leak. ""We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" Andersen wrote in a widely cited paper that had the effect of establishing a scientific consensus around the natural origin theory. US SCIENTISTS WHO DOWNPLAYED COVID-19 LAB LEAK ORIGINS THEORY SANG A DIFFERENT TUNE IN PRIVATE, EMAILS SHOW Andersen has stood by the natural origin theory and  explained to the New York Times  that he rejected the lab-leak origin theory after getting more information on the virus. He called the change of heart a ""textbook example of the scientific method where a preliminary hypothesis is rejected in favor of a competing hypothesis after more data become available and analyses are completed.""     
      Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021. 
       (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) NIH continues to insist that its grant funding to EcoAlliance that was then sub-awarded to the Wuhan Institute of Virology did not meet its definition of ""gain of function"" research.  NIH says  the genomic data of the bat coronaviruses studied under the federal grant demonstrates they ""are not and could not have become SARS-CoV-2."" However,  critics suspect  the leading scientists had a professional interest in not provoking backlash over gain-of-function research and inviting further scrutiny into a possibility that a lab in Wuhan that has received funding from the United States could have engaged in manipulating coronaviruses that sparked a pandemic.  ""There was an orchestrated effort at the start of 2020 to establish and enforce a false narrative about the origin,"" Ebright, the Rutgers professor, told Fox News Digital. ""Every informed person understood at the start of 2020, that there were two scenarios on the table that both required investigations.  GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Those who had been involved in these high-risk research activities, and in particular, those who had funded these high-risk research activities through EcoHealth Alliance in Wuhan sought immediately to clamp down on the discussion and enforce the false narrative that science tells us the virus entered humans [through] natural spillover, and furthermore, that it is the consensus of scientists. Both of those statements were false."" Fox News' Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.   "

""People are understanding this is about something more than just the vaccine mandate.""   — Bill Maher ONTARIO, CANADA LEADER DOUG FORD DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY OVER TRUCKER PROTESTS ""Woke, Inc."" author Vivek Ramaswamy agreed, telling Maher it's about the ""uprising of everyday citizens"" against ""the rise of this managerial class in democracies around the world.""  ""These are the unelected class leaders that ultimately, I think, are using the bureaucratic power to supplant the will of everyday – not only Americans but Canadians and Western Europeans too – and that's why we're seeing a fusion of both the left and the right here saying that, ‘Actually we want our voices heard. We want to be able to speak without fear of putting food on the dinner table,’"" Ramaswamy said.

       (Lisa Bennatan/Fox News Digital) Maher asked himself ""why truckers"" specifically were organizing such a protest and went on to answer his own question by pointing out they were the ones making the deliveries to the people working from home during the pandemic.  ""You didn't use that word ‘elitist’ in your whole speech, but, like, that's the word I think is on people's tongues and minds,"" Maher told Ramaswamy. ""There is this idea, and it's not wrong, that some people are staying home in their Lululemons and other people can afford to, like, wait out and get a free vacation and money from the government, and other people can't. And they're p---ed off- the people who can't.""  BILL MAHER SLAMS CANCEL CULTURE AFTER WHOOPI GOLDBERG, JEFF ZUCKER SCANDALS Trudeau sounds ‘like Hitler’ The HBO star then took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who he initially thought was a ""cool guy,"" for his vicious attacks toward the unvaccinated throughout the pandemic and his smearing of the trucker protesters.  ""He was talking about people who are not vaccinated. He said, ‘They don’t believe in science. They're often misogynistic, often racist,'"" Maher said, quoting Trudeau. ""No, they're not,"" Maher reacted. ""He said, ‘But they take up space. And with that we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country. Do we tolerate these people?’  ""'Tolerate these people'? Now you do sound like Hitler,"" Maher said. ""And recently, he talked about them holding unacceptable views… I mean, c'mon!"" Maher exclaimed. ""I think that's what get under people's skin.""

""I think this is what the truckers are mad at … all that money went up to the people who are in the top 20%?"" Maher asked.  MAHER PANICS ABOUT DEM PROSPECTS IN 2024: ‘AMERICA HAS LOST ITS FAITH IN JOE’ AND ‘THEIR BENCH IS SO THIN!’ ‘The system is so corrupt’ ""This is what people are angry at because the system is so corrupt. The system is so corrupt, and it's not just corporate elites, it's the corporate elites who are corrupting the system because of the money that corporation, their undue influence on a very, very corrupt government. This corruption is so baked into the cake and, of course, people are angry, people are enraged and they are legitimately enraged,"" former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson said.

And the judge said, ‘Oh no, the people need to know this’ and made those numbers public. So what's happening is the people are getting receipts for what we have been feeling for so long. This kind of economic injustice, this type of structural rigging so that whenever there's a problem, take care of the people who already have, and then the rest of the people who don't have -- well, good luck.

   Health  officials in the  United Kingdom  officially began monitoring a hybrid strain of the delta and omicron  coronavirus  known as ""deltacron"" last week after it was identified in a patient in the country, according to the country's Health Security Agency.  It is believed to have mutated in a patient who caught both variants at the same time but it's unclear if it first mutated in the U.K or another country, according to the Mirror newspaper.  A month ago, University of Cypress virologist Leondios Kostrikis’  said he had identified deltacron , which was dismissed by many experts as a likely lab contamination or error.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   What if …  Justin Trudeau  had met with the truckers the day they first arrived in Ottawa?   Instead of bolting and hiding out in an ""undisclosed location,"" what if  Canada’s prime minister  had emerged from the Privy Council building and talked to the Freedom Convoy drivers about their demands?  Might Trudeau have defused the entire protest? Would the truckers have been satisfied that  their cause was heard  and gone home?  CATHEDRAL OF THE LEFT – DEMS, BIDEN WANT TO REPLACE RULE OF LAW WITH THEIR BRAND OF RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY After all, these are truck drivers, not thugs. Even under the microscope of a censorious press, during those first heady few days, when massive crowds appeared from nowhere to cheer on the drivers, they committed no crimes, no injuries, no looting. There was not a single arrest, much to the disappointment of the liberal media.    Video More recently, as police moved in to dismantle the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge at Windsor, almost all the demonstrators peacefully decamped. CNN sounded downright disappointed to report that none went to jail.  The truckers are speaking for millions of working people in Canada and around the world who are sick of COVID restrictions and increasingly skeptical of the ""science"" behind them. Canada’s drivers were set off by a new rule, imposed even as the pandemic crested, that required all truckers entering the country from the U.S. be vaccinated or self-quarantine. The rule seemed unnecessary considering that 85% of the truckers had taken the shot, and that most spend the majority of their time alone.  Instead of engaging with the truckers, Trudeau ran like a rabbit, only to emerge from hiding to demean the protesters as a ""fringe minority.""   The new mandate also seemed whimsical in that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities have now proclaimed immunities from surviving COVID just as effective against infection as the vaccines. Truckers were praised as selfless essential workers as they continued to work through the pandemic, putting themselves in harm’s way. Presumably, many got sick and now have antibodies; they may not need the vaccine.  What was Trudeau scared of? That the crowd of burly drivers might scoff at his perfectly coiffed hair? Not be properly reverent of his literature degree from McGill University? That the truckers might not respect a lifelong politician whose career rested on the fame of his father?    Video Instead of engaging with the truckers, Trudeau ran like a rabbit, only to emerge from hiding to demean the protesters as a ""fringe minority."" The irony is, of course, that Trudeau himself represents a minority, with his Liberal Party setting a record last fall for the lowest vote share of any party to ever form a government, winning a mere 33% of the popular vote. As in 2019, the Conservatives won the popular vote.    Trudeau’s response was reprehensible. His unwavering hostility was joined by officials in Nova Scotia who declared it illegal for people to cheer on the Freedom Convoy, threatening to impose fines of up to $10,000 for waving the Canadian flag. Ontario Premier Doug Ford more recently threatened truckers with $100,000 fines and a year in prison. Can these politicians hear themselves?  Needless to say, faced with such tyrannical overreach, the truckers doubled down. The blockades on crucial U.S.-Canada border crossings have caused supply problems and began to shut down manufacturing in both countries.      Video The protests may come to the U.S., as we predicted. And Joe Biden is poised to make exactly the same mistakes as Trudeau. Already his henchmen in the press have labeled the convoys right-wing extremists – because, you know, they don’t bow to Anthony Fauci and didn’t attend Ivy League schools.   The Freedom Convoy puts Biden in a pickle. When he recently sat down with the Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, he celebrated our countries’ shared values, including ""the foundational commitment to the dignity of workers and the need to treat all people with respect."" Question for Joe: does that include truckers?    Video The reality is that Biden, like Trudeau, is a lifetime pol who has never worked with his hands and has no regard for people who do. He celebrates  labor , writ large, because he is tight with union leaders who fund his campaigns, but workers? Not so much.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters helped elect Biden. Their website claims that during the election, they ""made 340,000 phone calls and sent … out 1.3 million pieces of mail and reached more than 350,000 members via digital advertising."" In addition, the Teamsters spent over $6 million for Democrat-aligned PACs.    Video What did they get in return? A White House that ""prioritizes collective bargaining, worker organizing and unions,"" rightly claim the bosses. Biden is indeed working to help Big Labor rebuild their dwindling ranks, all to fund the union bosses’ coffers and raise money for Democrats.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Biden, in the final days of the campaign, promised Teamsters he would have their backs, saying ""We need to protect you, pay you…"" That was then.    Video Not only will the Freedom Convoy showcase Biden’s phony affection for blue-collar workers, it comes at an awkward time. Officials across the country are dropping mask mandates, responding to recent findings that the masking provided little protection and also to polling showing that voters have had enough of the theater and questionable science.  As the New York Times reported, numerous polls show ""the desire to return to normalcy has approached or even overtaken alarm about the coronavirus itself."" Why not? People understand that the most vulnerable among us – the old and those weakened by comorbidities – need to be vaccinated and boosted, possibly on an ongoing basis.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But as the potency of the virus wanes, many are ready to accept that COVID-19 is like the flu, a recurring health risk to some but mostly not lethal and certainly no reason to put our lives on hold.    Justin Trudeau and Joe Biden could learn a thing or two from the prime minister of Sweden, who recently announced that her government was dropping all COVID restrictions, declaring, ""The pandemic isn’t over, but it is moving into a new phase.""

   Last year,  President Joe Biden  signed into law the American Rescue Plan (ARP) — a nearly $2 trillion bill sold as a critical boost to a flagging economy, allegedly ""focused on what people need most."" In hindsight, opponents were right about the bill — and the legislators who supported this wasteful and damaging deficit spending should be accountable. When the ARP was being debated, critics argued that numerous provisions were poorly crafted and were more likely to worsen the situation than improve it. Instead of starting with inexpensive, common-sense reforms that would spur growth and improve pandemic response, the ARP was built around a pre-existing partisan wish list with little consideration of the problems at the time. It’s no surprise the results have been disappointing. Economists warned that the bill could push  inflation  higher — and inflation has indeed reached its highest level in 40 years. It hasn’t generated the promised millions of new jobs. Provisions that were supposed to lead to school reopenings and widely available testing did not deliver. States that were supposedly in desperate need of federal help now report huge federally-subsidized spending increases over the last year. And with more ""excess revenue"" projected in the months ahead, many states are likely to approve more new and wasteful spending. CNBC, CNN SOUND ALARM ON INFLATION: ‘YOU HAVE TO GO TO 1982 TO FIND A HIGHER NUMBER’ Where did Congress and the White House go wrong? It was a mistake to provide more than $520 billion to states and localities that were already seeing a rebound in tax revenues when the bill was under consideration. A year later, many states are spending historic budget surpluses. Instead of refunding it to taxpayers who are still dealing with  coronavirus  concerns, some states regard tax reductions as something they may be ""forced"" into.

In rushing to approve more generous rules for Medicaid, the Paycheck Protection Program, and the child tax credit, little thought was given to targeting relief where it was needed, and avoiding unintended negative consequences. That has led to fraudulent claims, inflationary pressure, and taxpayer money going to people who did not need it.    Video The ARP also failed to deliver on the promises of supporters that it would help ensure students were educated despite the pandemic. Taxpayers were told it was crucial to provide billions in new spending on rapid and reliable testing, ""to help schools reopen."" Instead, more than one million public school students were dealing with district-wide school closures at the start of this year. And coronavirus testing remained a problem thanks to bad management and bureaucratic incompetence. After signing the bill into law,  President Biden  noted the potential for fraud and misuse of these funds, and  highlighted the need  for oversight, transparency and accountability in implementing the law. A few months later, the U.S. Secret Service noted nearly $100 billion in potentially fraudulent activity related to COVID relief. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Despite these warnings, leaders in  Congress  have largely washed their hands of oversight responsibility, with little effort to prevent waste or find better uses for dollars that go unspent.

   We have dedicated much of our careers to fighting and overturning heavy-handed government mandates. One thing we’ve learned over the years is that when  Democrats have power in Washington , they typically use it to impose freedom-restricting rules, whether it be on small businesses, family farmers or innovators. But we’ve never seen Democrats try to regulate the behavior of toddlers – until now. As parents ourselves, we are outraged that the federal government is using taxpayer money to make children as young as  2 years old have to wear face masks .    Video Head Start facilities provide early education services to low-income children through 1,600 facilities across the country, including in  South Dakota  and Louisiana. The Biden administration is now requiring Head Start grant recipients to mask toddlers at all times – even if they’re outside on the playground. REPUBLICANS MUST REMIND AMERICANS THEY ARE THE SOBER ALTERNATIVE TO HYPER-WOKE DEMOCRATS The decision to mask or not mask a toddler should be made by a parent or guardian, not Joe Biden. Not only is this decision to police schoolyard activities yet another affront to parents’ rights by the Biden administration, even worse is nothing about this nationwide policy is based on science or common sense. We are heading into the third year of the pandemic, and we know a lot more now than we did in March 2020. Young children are less vulnerable to COVID-19 than other demographic groups. Thankfully, transmission among children is low, and symptoms, if any, are usually mild. That said, we understand some parents or individual Head Start programs may want to take extra measures to protect their children, including masking themselves or their kids, and they have every right to do so.    Video But the federal government should stay out of that decision-making process, especially for Americans who are least at risk for the virus but high at risk for being left behind educationally or emotionally. The United States is an outlier in how it treats young people during this pandemic. The World Health Organization explicitly states that ""children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks … based on the safety and overall interest of the child."" Also, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control doesn’t recommend mask-wearing for children under the age of 12.   Video A face mask may be one of the most debilitating learning barriers for young children. The early years are when kids learn to recognize facial cues, understand emotions, and speak and express themselves. Prolonged masking directly interferes with a student’s ability to learn verbal and non-verbal communication skills, which can set them back for the rest of their life.

But that doesn’t mean we can let the people responsible for this mandate off the hook, nor can we stop this effort until the rule is finally dead.   Video If President Biden won’t withdraw this harmful requirement, we’ll work to force his hand.

   The Los Angeles Youth Orchestra performed with masks on Sunday outside SoFi Stadium in Inglewood,  California  just prior to  Super Bowl  kickoff, video shows, while thousands just inside the venue ditched the face coverings. The group, which consisted of roughly 20 young musicians, including high school seniors,  performed  ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" alongside gospel duo, MARY MARY, who didn't wear face coverings as they sang, according to the television broadcast and reports.  The performance took place at an area outside SoFi Stadium just before the big game, as thousands of fans appeared to pack the seats of the stadium without masks. It's unclear if the YOLA musicians were told to wear masks and only a few of them appeared to not wear the face coverings as they performed.  BENGALS' JOE MIXON CONNECTS WITH TEE HIGGINS FOR TD SCORE IN SUPER BOWL LVI: ‘CINCY SPECIAL’ Fans who enter the Super Bowl LVI campus at SoFi Stadium are required to comply with all Los Angeles County COVID-19 health and safety protocols before they can enter.

   Some state and local  Democratic  leaders are starting to change their tune on  COVID-19  mask and  vaccine  mandates; others are not. As the initial spike of COVID-19's omicron variant dwindles ahead of spring, some Democratic mayors and governors are lifting rules that require people to show proof of vaccination at local businesses, wear masks indoors or send their children to school wearing masks. ""It’s pretty clear that these various non-pharmaceutical interventions, which have never been well attested since they were first put in place roughly two years ago, just weren't working,"" Doug Badger, a senior fellow for domestic policy studies at conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. Denver among the first Denver Mayor Michael Hancock was one of the first to lift restrictions when he announced Jan. 31 that the city would not extend its emergency order mandating masks and proof of vaccination for entry into Denver businesses.

""It has been an incredibly hard two years for all of us. We need a little less anger and petulance and a little more understanding for folks toward one another."" Starting Feb. 26, Denver schools will no longer require students to wear masks. DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO REVERSE COURSE ON COVID RESTRICTIONS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS Mayors of other major cities, including Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser; New York City Mayor Eric Adams; Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot; and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, have yet to issue similar announcements.  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu last Tuesday said the city would reconsider its vaccine mandates once there are fewer than 200 COVID-19 hospitalizations per day, according to  MassLive . HOUSE DEMOCRATS REELECTION CHAIR CALLS FOR ROLLING BACK COVID RESTRICTIONS TO ‘GIVE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK’ Statewide rollbacks But some governors are taking a statewide approach to ending emergency orders. Last Monday,  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy  announced that school children and staffers would no longer be required to wear masks, starting March 7, after he extended the order in January. Also last Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom  announced  that state residents will no longer have to mask indoors starting next week. The governors of New York, Illinois, Connecticut, Oregon and Delaware have made similar plans to roll back mask mandates.

DeSantis could have put the Cuomo policies in effect in Florida,"" he does believe states' independent experiences speak for themselves. ""If the various claims about masks and distancing and lockdowns and all the rest had produced demonstrably different results in the states where they were tried, we might argue that having a uniform approach would have been better. But the experience has been quite otherwise,"" he said. ""And I think that's why you're beginning to see even governors who have been very supportive of restrictions and have implemented enforced restrictions are rapidly retreating from them."" MSNBC, OTHERS HIT AS ‘HYPOCRITES’ FOR CONTRADICTORY COVERAGE ON YOUNGKIN, MURPHY MASK MANDATE ORDERS Same levels of infection Most leaders rolling back mandates tout declining COVID-19 case numbers and high vaccination rates, but Badger says other states that never had those mandates in the first place have experienced similar infection and hospitalization spikes and declines over the past two years after the initial outbreak in the spring of 2020. ""The communities, states and cities that had mandates and various restrictions in place suffered the same levels of COVID infection and hospitalizations as the states, counties and municipalities that did not put those restrictions in place,"" Badger explained.  ""And that's not just true of the United States. You can look at Israel, Denmark, the U.K., France, Spain — all countries with higher vaccination rates than the U.S. and more sweeping restrictions in place at the national level than the U.S, and they ended up with higher rates of infection on a population-adjusted basis than the U.S. did.""

       (Reuters) A recent study released by Johns Hopkins University indicates that pandemic restrictions like lockdowns and non-pharmaceutical interventions like mask mandates had ""little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality.""  Additionally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated in January that cloth masks, commonly worn by many Americans, provide the  least amount of protection.  The  Mayo Clinic  said in late December that patients and visitors could no longer wear only a cloth mask and must have a medical-grade face covering. While they recognized that some cloth masks could provide sufficient protection, many commonly worn types did not.

""When you politicize things and start to say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, and unvaccinated people are crowding sick patients out of hospital beds, you don't persuade unvaccinated people to get vaccinated.

After Feb. 15, unvaccinated people still will be required to be masked indoors, and everyone — vaccinated or not — will have to wear masks in higher-risk areas like public transit and nursing homes and other congregate living facilities, officials said. Local governments can continue their own indoor masking requirements and last week Los Angeles County’s health officials said they intend to keep theirs in place beyond the state deadline. State officials also announced that indoor ""mega-events"" with more than 1,000 people will have to require vaccinations or negative tests for those attending and those who are unvaccinated will be required to wear masks. For outdoor events with more than 10,000 people, there is no vaccination requirement but masks or negative tests are recommended. Those thresholds increase from the current 500 attendees for indoor and 5,000 attendees for outdoor events.

California has seen a 65% drop in case rates since the peak during the wintertime omicron surge. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s  administration brought back the masking mandate in mid-December as omicron gained momentum and last month extended the requirement through Feb. 15. California passed 80,000 pandemic deaths and 8 million confirmed positive cases, but new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions all continued falling and are projected to keep declining at a rapid clip. Before resuming the masking requirement in December, California had lifted the requirement for people who were vaccinated as of June 15, a date that Newsom had described then as the state’s grand reopening. However, many counties soon reinstituted local mask orders as the summer delta surge took hold. NFL WAS 'AWARE' EMINEM WAS GOING TO KNEEL DURING HALFTIME PERFORMANCE, REP SAYS

Sen.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   FIRST ON FOX:  Sen.  Roger Marshall , R-Kan., plans to introduce legislation on Monday that aims to end the current  COVID- 19   national emergency declaration. The legislation is powered by a provision in the National Emergencies Act (NEA), a law that, when invoked, grants presidents special powers to deal with national emergencies outside natural disasters or war. Marshall’s bill would revoke many of the federal government's expanded powers to respond to the pandemic on a national level. FAUCI SAYS ‘FULL-BLOWN’ COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS ALMOST OVER IN US     ""With COVID cases and hospitalizations on the decline, 94 percent of Americans having immunity to COVID, mask mandates falling by the wayside, and 70 percent of Americans agreeing ‘it’s time we accept that COVID is here to stay’ and that ‘we just need to get on with our lives,’ it’s clear we need a new approach to COVID as we learn to live with it,"" Marshall told Fox News Digital in a Monday email. ""That new approach starts with putting an end to the COVID national state of emergency,"" the senator continued. Both Presidents Trump and Biden invoked the NEA to enact and continue the national emergency to deal with the pandemic.

It is likely the president will extend the emergency declaration again. Congress is charged with determining whether an emergency under the NEA should continue but has mostly ceded the decision up to the executive branch.

       There have only been six termination resolutions since the enactment of the NEA, and there are currently 31 national emergencies that have been in effect since the Carter administration.

But what Los Angelinos and Californians recognize also is after that kids go back to school today having to wear masks. It's a reminder of the absurdity of the dynamic and how the elites, their politicians and celebrities don't believe that they're at risk. Otherwise, they would cover their faces because they're the ones that matter, right? But they don't believe they're at risk, which creates less trust, more of an illegitimacy of government that Americans are realizing. They don't even believe in their own orders. So why are they giving them to us? And especially why are they forcing children who, as we know now, are the least vulnerable? WATCH THE INTERVIEW FROM ‘THE FAULKNER FOCUS’ BELOW:   Video  "

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Democrats  and double standards have always gone hand-in-hand. But they've never been quite as blatant as we’ve seen during the  pandemic . Last week, photos surfaced of  Georgia  Democrat Stacey Abrams grinning maskless while a classroom full of masked children sat behind her. Two days later,  Michigan  Rep. Elissa Slotkin snapped a mask-free selfie at a campaign event while her masked constituents sat in the background. And just over the weekend,  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti  and a host of other celebrities were spotted without masks at the  Super Bowl  in LA, where an indoor mask mandate is still in effect. Just two weeks earlier, Garcetti was criticized for posing maskless with  California Gov. Gavin Newsom  at an NFL playoff game. Those are just the most recent examples. Democrats have been flouting their own rules since the beginning of the pandemic — and they’re often repeat offenders. The message is clear: Mask mandates only apply to regular Americans, not the elite Democrats who put the mandates in place. The hypocrisy is the point. DAN CRENSHAW TORCHES MASKLESS CELEBRITIES AT SUPER BOWL: 'ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS' As Democrats try to hold on to power, our children pay the price. A child psychiatrist from Johns Hopkins University is warning students are falling behind in school due to forced masking. It ""affects learning and development, particularly for our youngest learners"" and ""provides little discernible benefit,"" making this crisis even worse. Speech therapists are reporting a 364% increase in referrals of babies and toddlers with speech delays. Deaf and hard-of-hearing children experience ""significantly hampered word recognition"" because masks stop them from reading lips. Some masks that kids are forced to wear are ""very hard to breathe in.""   Video While the consequences of masking are everywhere, there’s little evidence in favor of forced masking, especially for children. The science simply does not support mask mandates on toddlers in schools. That’s why most countries in the Western world don't force kids to wear masks. The United States is one of just seven that does. The U.S. represents freedom. It's embarrassing that we've so comprehensively failed to live up to that reputation when it comes to forcing masks on kids. But the  Biden administration  still refuses to change its guidance. Just this past week, Biden  CDC Director Rochelle Walensky  said ""now is not the moment"" to drop mandates. Maskless photo-ops are a symbol of Democrats' lack of respect for their constituents   In fact, Democrats are so committed to mask mandates that they’re denying education to students who refuse to comply with their mask demands. In  Virginia ’s Loudoun County, unmasked students are being suspended for ""noncompliance."" One Loudoun County school official threatened criminal charges of trespassing for children who come to school without a mask. As a result, dozens of students in Fairfax County have been suspended indefinitely. Fortunately, the state’s new Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin is fighting to put an end to this nonsense. The attacks come even as Gov. Youngkin issued an order giving parents the freedom to make their own decisions about their child’s mask.   Video As parents fight back to protect their children and Democrat poll numbers plummet, government bureaucrats are changing their tune on masks. Last Monday, liberal governors in Connecticut, Delaware and New Jersey announced they would lift their school mask requirements in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, states like New York and California announced they would end their indoor mask mandates for businesses, although they’ve refused to lift the mandate for kids in schools. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It’s not that Democrats have finally recognized the damage of their policies or the uselessness of masks. It’s political — just as it's always been. Mask mandates are increasingly unpopular. With the midterm elections less than a year away and Virginia electing Republicans to all three statewide offices, Democrats are nervous. In the coming months, you can expect them to reverse their coronavirus policies and claim that ""the science has changed."" But the truth is, Biden and the Democrats lied.   Video While Democrats kept your toddler in masks for two years,  Republican  governors like Florida’s  Ron DeSantis  and Texas’s  Greg Abbott  started getting their states back to normal long ago. Republican governors empowered parents to make the best choices for their children.

He was holding his breath. 78,000 people were holding their breath the entire game. … The whole thing is a joke. They were handing out N-95 masks for everybody entering the stadium. The only concession stand that didn’t make money was the facemask stands. Kids are going to school now and have to wear masks.

   Nets star Kyrie Irving remains unvaccinated and unashamed. As COVID cases across the country continue to fall and mask mandates drop quicker than NBA defenders trying to guard him, Brooklyn’s point guard remains firm in his stance against getting vaccinated. ""There’s no guilt that I feel,"" Irving said of his decision to refrain from getting vaccinated, per  ESPN’s Nick Friedell . CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Nor should he feel any guilt. Whether to get a shot or not is a personal choice, one that Irving has every right to make on his own. His decision means, at least for the time being, he can play only in Brooklyn’s away games because New York City still has comical COVID restrictions and mandates in place.

""And some people say it’s as simple as, ‘Hey, go get this, go get the shot.’ No, it’s not as simple as that for me in my life, but ultimately still praying for a better outcome."" Though he has intentionally missed those COVID shots off the court, Irving’s been his usual self on it. He’s boosted the Nets’ offense, averaging 24 points, five assists and five boards per game since making his season debut in early January. Now that New York is seemingly coming to their senses about the ridiculousness of the city’s mandates, the guilt-free Irving could soon assist the Nets at home, as well as on the road.

       (Fox News Digital/Lisa Bennatan) DAVID MARCUS: CANADA TRUCKERS WANT FREEDOM, NOT A GLOBAL WORLD WHERE ELITES CONTROL THEIR LIVES The inescapable question as one talks to the protesters is why hasn’t Trudeau talked to them? Three weeks ago he had a choice, he could have listened to their concerns, shown some degree of interest in them and in all likelihood stomped out the story. Instead, he made ridiculous claims about them being fringe racists, and stooges for American right-wingers. What he got for this choice was not just a Canadian crisis, but a global one. As conflict emerges on the streets of Paris, and the blockade of the border bridge outside of Detroit was just brought to an end, one has to ask if any of this would be happening had Trudeau simply met with these protesters when this all started. In the end, this arrogance and obstinacy from Trudeau and his government has only hardened the position of the protesters.   Video In a tremendous self-own the CBC, a state owned and operated news outlet, ran a story on Sunday with the headline ""Why the word ‘freedom’ is such a rallying cry for protesters."" A subheading reads, ""The word has become common among far-right groups, experts say."" Excuse me? Can this be real? The Canadian government through its media lackeys are really running down the concept of freedom? Meanwhile, the protest seems to be having its desired effect, at least in part. On Monday, Premier of Ontario Doug Ford announced that as of March 1st a slew of restrictions will be cut back. These include limits on indoor capacity and the vaccine passport mandate to enter venues. Ford claims these reversals were not because of the trucker convoy but ""in spite of it."" Maybe that is true, but it sure doesn’t look that way.   Video So now, in a mere three weeks, the position of the Canadian government has gone from, the truckers are white supremacists, to the truckers are agents of American right-wing interests, to making major concessions. These concessions could not have been made or even discussed 21 days ago? Why not? CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER From the beginning of the pandemic and its myriad state imposed restrictions the fear of many people has been that this grip on power will not be relinquished even when the medical emergency is abated. Trudeau’s response to the trucker protest can only solidify those fears. It is anathema to the very concept of democracy, and indeed, freedom, for the leader of Canada to simply refuse to listen to the legitimate concerns of her people. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What has resonated across the globe from this group of Canadians demanding their rights in the freezing cold is not just their words and willpower, but the absolutely shameless response from Trudeau, who at the start of this whole thing went so far as to go into hiding. Hiding from what? What I have seen is patriotic Canadians waving their flag and singing their anthem. If that is enough to scare Justin Trudeau then maybe Canada needs a leader with a bit more courage. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS  "

   The head of the  World Health Organization’s   Europe  office said Tuesday that  health officials  are turning their attention to growing rates of  COVID-19 infection  in Eastern Europe, where six countries — including  Russia  and  Ukraine  — have seen a doubling in case counts over the last two weeks. Dr. Hans Kluge  said the 53-country region, which stretches to former Soviet republics into central  Asia , has now tallied more than 165 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 1.8 million deaths linked to the pandemic — including 25,000 in the last week alone. WHO TRACKING 4 OMICRON SUB-VARIANTS, SAYS PREVENTING ALL TRANSMISSIONS 'NOT THE GOAL' ""Today, our focus is towards the east of the WHO European region,"" Kluge  said in Russian at a media briefing , pointing to a surge in the highly transmissible omicron variant. ""Over the past two weeks, cases of COVID-19 have more than doubled in six countries in this part of the region (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Russian Federation and Ukraine).""

He's still recovering from bruises on his face and head. Norton, 84, served overseas in Korea after the peace treaty was signed, rising to the rank of sergeant in the  Marines . All told, he served the nation proudly up through 1966.  Norton explained to Fox News Digital that he'd just gotten off an exercise bicycle (and yes, masks were required even during workouts).

      Marine veteran Ed Norton was injured during a fall when the mask he had to wear inside a local gym (during his workout) moved up on his face and obscured his vision as he was walking to another exercise machine.

Their first task was to stop the bleeding.  Norton said he was given a bandage and an ice pack that the nurse got from the gym's managers. Then two trainers ""picked me up and got me off the floor,"" said Norton. ""I really whacked my head."" CT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WANT MASK MANDATES DROPPED NOW The doctor who attended to Norton told him he felt his injuries were serious enough to warrant a CAT scan, which Norton decided to forego. The Board of Health in Norton’s town, which is roughly 12 miles north of  Boston , voted this past Thursday, Feb. 10, 2022, to rescind the town's mask mandate for indoor spaces.  Ed Norton's injury happened the week before, when the mandates were still in place.

   NEW ORLEANS –  The  coronavirus  shut down Mardi Gras parades and Carnivals in cities across the globe last year, but the tradition is now making a comeback.  City officials in  New Orleans  have been preparing for months to make sure celebrations could resume this year. In August, Mayor LaToya Cantrell introduced a vaccine or negative test mandate to enter all  bars and restaurants.

""It was awful.""  Dilling-Francis is the executive director of the Backstreet Cultural Museum in the city. The museum is home to a collection of Mardi Gras and Carnival costumes that date back decades.

This created the subculture of Mardi Gras known as the Mardi Gras Indians. Men, women and children dress in lavish, colorful suits to pay homage to the Native Americans who helped protect runaway slaves.  ""Now that we have the freedom to celebrate with everyone, it's even more important to come out and pay our respects to our ancestors,"" Dilling-Francis said.

Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., led 26 of his colleagues who believe that, as many locations and businesses in the U.S. have reopened to the public, Congress should do the same by allowing constituents and tourists in.

""It is long past time for the Senate to reopen its doors to those who sent us here to represent them – the American people,"" Hagerty said in a statement. ""Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, vaccines have been available for over a year for those who want them, and Americans from coast to coast have learned to live their lives safely despite the pandemic. From stores to venues and most workplaces and schools, the rest of the United States has reopened, and it’s time for the Senate to do the same.""

   The purge has begun. Thus far, three branches of the  military  — the  Navy ,  Air Force , and  Marine Corps  — have discharged more than 650 members due to their objection to the Department of Defense’s vaccine mandate. The Army recently announced it will soon join those branches. Kicking out hundreds, possibly thousands, of service members because of their beliefs is not only devastating to troop morale, but also harms our national security interests. General Jimmy Doolittle, who masterminded the legendary Doolittle Raid, famously said ""there is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer."" General Doolittle was referring to the millions of Americans who answered the call to serve after the attack on Pearl Harbor plunged America into World War II.  Doolittle understood that a military comprised of those who serve because of their love of country is far superior to a conscripted one. BIDEN'S ‘WOKE’ AGENDA COSTS MILITARY 6 MILLION MAN-HOURS, REPUBLICANS SAY Today, America still has an all-volunteer force. Indeed, young patriots continue to be the lifeblood of our military. Many cite their religious belief as the primary motivation for joining. But if our nation’s leaders continue to prioritize politics above all else and fulfill their promise to kick out service members because of their beliefs, we run the serious risk of losing that lifeblood.  The message from the Pentagon is clear: if you do not get the vaccine, you are unworthy to serve.  The purge that is now underway will hollow out the military, leaving those who were forced to be vaccinated questioning their leaders, and making military service far less attractive to America’s sons and daughters.  The purge that is now underway will hollow out the military, leaving those who were forced to be vaccinated questioning their leaders, and making military service far less attractive to America’s sons and daughters.    The purge’s effects are not just devastating to morale, but we can expect a measurable reduction in readiness that will harm America’s national security. The adage ""freedom isn’t free"" is more accurate than we might realize. According to estimates, it costs approximately $15,000 to successfully recruit one eligible person to join the military.  It then costs another $50,000 to $75,000 to train, equip, and prepare them for service, depending on their assigned duty.  For special forces, such as Navy SEALs, the costs can skyrocket into the millions of dollars per service member.

But those figures must be  doubled  in order to recruit and train replacements for the unfortunate service members who were involuntarily separated.  NAVY CHAPLAIN AMONG SAILOR DENIED RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE: ‘KICK IN THE GUT’ This undermines one of the Navy’s stated reasons for its vaccine mandate: cost savings. According to one Navy official, it is less expensive to kick out a sailor than to conduct a medical evacuation due to a COVID outbreak.  This dubious argument fails to consider the financial cost to  replace  that sailor.  It also does not account for the degradation in trust, morale and esprit de corps that is necessary for any effective military force.  Talk about fraud, waste, and abuse.    Thankfully, the hearts of our volunteers still beat strong. My firm, First Liberty Institute, represents 35 Navy SEALs and other Naval Special Warfare members who will not be kicked out.  These courageous men stepped forward, just as Doolittle’s Raiders did nearly 80 years ago to the day, and dared to challenge the Pentagon’s refusal to grant even a single religious accommodation to the vaccine mandate.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In the first successful challenge to the military vaccine mandate, Judge Reed O’Connor recognized ""there is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment.  There is no military exclusion from our Constitution."" And while we hope to provide similar relief across the entire Navy, there are thousands of service members across the entire military facing the purge. The cost to America in lost military manpower, leadership, combat experience and skills goes far beyond a dollar value. The harm to national security by kicking out service members because they object to the vaccine is immeasurable.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The solution is simple. If the Pentagon won’t lift the vaccine mandate, it should at the very least begin honoring its constitutional obligation and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine. This first step in recognizing that the Constitution applies to those defending it will ensure we can continue to attract, recruit and retain the best military on earth.

Why a lawsuit over forced masking of our children in Virginia is necessary,," February 16, 2022 5:00am EST","  close     Video   VA parents suing school officials over mask mandate after Gov Youngkin's executive order made masks optional   Carrie Lukas, who is one of the Fairfax County parents involved in the lawsuit, joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the latest in the push to roll back COVID-related policies in the classroom. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Our three families together have 10 kids in Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). This week, we filed a lawsuit against the Fairfax County School Board and our superintendent for forcing our kids to wear masks and denying our rights as parents, even after Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order specifically affirming that we should be allowed to choose whether our kids wear masks during school. We are grateful that bipartisan legislation to eliminate mask mandates in  schools  will soon become law in  Virginia . Yet our lawsuit remains necessary to ensure that Fairfax County students get true relief from the sometimes Draconian masking rules and punishments related to mandatory mask-wearing.  MORE STATE, LOCAL LEADERS DIAL BACK COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS AS CASES FALL Fairfax County’s reaction to Gov. Youngkin’s executive order demonstrates that it is also necessary to ensure that FCPS does not continue, even after passage of the bill currently working its way through the legislative process, to discriminate against children in its school district through arbitrary and punitive ""mitigation measures"" directed at those whose parents choose for their children not to wear masks while at school. Indeed, FCPS should have to account for how their actions have harmed children and for putting the interests of the children in their care last.   Video For months, scientific evidence has overwhelmingly shown that the masks FCPS has required do not protect against  COVID ’s transmission. At the same time, there has been growing awareness that masking children for 40 hours a week results in significant harm. Children are by far the group least vulnerable to COVID. While adults have lifted masking requirements for themselves in bars and restaurants, they continue to force children to mask, selfishly prioritizing their’ interests over the well-being of kids. This hypocrisy took center stage this weekend, where we all witnessed the spectacle of politicians and public figures – who have been in favor of strict mask policies – partying unmasked at the  Super Bowl . Though these politicians and celebrities are doubtlessly hypocrites, they are right not to wear the ineffective masks and to enjoy their lives. We merely wish that our children would have the right to do the same. We know personally the high price children have had to pay. We’ve seen our children suffer from long-term masking with headaches and feelings of isolation. It’s time for these harmful policies to end. SUPER BOWL FANS REJECT MASK MANDATE DESPITE BEING GIVEN ONE AT STADIUM: 'SUPER-SPREADER BOWL' FCPS has claimed that their hands have been tied by CDC guidelines. Yet those guidelines merely say that the CDC recommends that students mask; the CDC also recommends that schools maintain 3 feet of physical distance between students, a recommendation that they (wisely) have chosen not to embrace. This shows they could have also chosen to loosen the masking requirement to allow parents to decide whether their children are more at risk from COVID or from the harm caused by masking. There has been growing awareness that masking children for 40 hours a week results in significant harm.   FCPS has crowed about the high rate of ""compliance"" with mask mandates among students and families. FCPS should revisit their history lessons and note that people complying to avoid severe penalties and social ostracism do not reflect support but, rather, fear.    Video Indeed, we have heard from scores of FCPS families and hundreds across the state of Virginia who say they, too, wish to opt out of masking and fear how masking is harming their children but do not want to be on the wrong side of school officials. Our own children hesitate to voice their opinions about masks during school since they are used to having mask protocols – never letting your nose show, stifling yawns and laughter – swiftly and strictly enforced by teachers and school officials. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This lawsuit will help change that. We seek to have FCPS expunge the punishments imposed on students who attempted to follow their own and their parents’ preference that they unmask. We seek to have them affirm that parents have the right to make decisions about their children’s health and education. And we hope for Fairfax County Schools' punitive measures, which they doubtlessly believe will be imposed on their political enemies, to come to an end once and for all. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last year, FCPS put off resuming in-person school as long as politically possible, despite children suffering tremendous learning loss as a result.

   People who have a  vitamin D deficiency  are more likely to have a severe or fatal case of  COVID-19 , researchers said.  In a retrospective study published in the journal PLOS ONE,  scientists  from Galilee Medical Center and Bar Ilan University in  Israel  examined the records of more than 1,176 patients admitted between April 7, 2020, and Feb. 4, 2021, to the Nahariya-based Galilee Medical Center with positive PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests for SAR-CoV-2. Those records were searched for vitamin D levels measured two weeks to two years prior to  infection . VITAMIN D DEFIENCY LINKED TO MORTALITY RISK IN SOME PEOPLE, RESEARCHERS SAY The individuals  were categorized  according to vitamin D levels – marked as deficient, insufficient, adequate and high-normal – and COVID-19 disease severity, which was determined utilizing a multivariable regression analysis.  More than 250 patients had records of vitamin D levels prior to COVID-19 infection, and the team found that patients with vitamin D deficiency were 14 times more likely to have a severe or critical case of COVID-19.

   The Chinese regime is hiding no more. At the  Winter Olympics , a proud – and arrogant – ruling group is flaunting an image the world abhors.  Beijing, for instance, chose Qi Fabao as a torchbearer. The colonel, a ""Galwan Valley border clash hero"" according to  Communist Party media , led a surprise attack on the night of June 15, 2020, deep in Indian-controlled territory in the Himalayas. Twenty Indian troopers were killed, and Qi suffered a four-inch gash on his forehead.      
      Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng lights the torch before the start of the torch relay for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing on Feb. 2, 2022.
       (AP Photo/Sam McNeil) New Delhi was outraged. It had planned to send diplomats to the opening and closing ceremonies. After the announcement that Qi would carry the torch in a relay, however,  India  pulled its representation, joining the American-led diplomatic boycott of the Games.  IN OLYMPICS COVERAGE, NBC SHOULD STAND FOR ‘NATIONAL BEIJING CORPORATION’ ""The torchbearers of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are broadly representative and meet the selection standards,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian at a press conference, in response to New Delhi’s boycott. ""What I want to say is that we hope relevant party can view the torchbearers in an objective and rational way and refrain from making politicized interpretation.""    Video Thomas Bach rushed to Beijing’s defense. The International Olympic Committee president, responding to a question about Col. Qi, pointed out that a British veteran was a torchbearer in the 2012 London Summer Games.  The two cases, however, are not comparable. Ricky Furgusson, who lost both legs in Afghanistan, was fighting terrorists who had attacked innocent civilians. Qi, on the other hand, was an aggressor, leading a sneak attack on soldiers defending their own soil.  China’s crimes, I think, are worse than those of the Third Reich during the mid-1930s.   ""While various countries feature their military at events like the Olympics, in this case official Chinese media made the unusual move of identifying his specific engagement, calling him a ‘hero’ of Galwan, and making it clear he was chosen because he was involved in the attack that killed Indians,"" said Cleo Paskal of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies to me, referring to Qi. ""What this signals to New Delhi is that India is now on the official list of Communist Party enemies – along with fellow Quad members Japan, the United States and Australia. Beijing is telling the Chinese people that killing Indians is something worth celebrating."" Beijing has made the Games more than a celebration of murdering Indian soldiers. The Communist Party is boasting about two genocides. First, Uyghur cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang lit the Olympic flame along with a ""Han"" athlete.    Video China’s regime is committing genocide by, among other acts, killing Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities as well as forcing abortions and sterilizations. The Chinese regime is also committing crimes against humanity – mass detentions, torture, rape, organ harvesting and slavery – against them. In addition, its treatment of Tibetans is barbaric.  Commentators are fond of comparing the ongoing Winter Games to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.

Republicans pledge to uncover COVID origins: 'We will leave no stone unturned',Marisa Schultz," February 16, 2022 7:12am EST","  close     Video   Risky gain of function research is mired in secrecy after the coronavirus pandemic   Fox News State Department correspondent Benjamin Hall reports on the murky world of gain of function research after the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China is suspected of starting the pandemic. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Republicans  trying to unearth the origins of  COVID-19  say they will launch a full-blown investigation – with the support of subpoena power – into the cause of the global pandemic if the GOP takes control of  Congress  in January. For months, Republicans have been calling on Democrats to hold investigative public hearings and to compel testimony from grant agencies to learn more about the research being conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in  China  – to no avail. But if Congress flips to GOP control during the  midterm elections , Republicans say they are prepared to use all the tools of the majority to find answers.  ""House Republicans on Energy and Commerce are determined to get to the bottom of the origins of COVID-19, and we will leave no stone unturned,"" Washington GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, told Fox News Digital. 10 REASONS WHY SCIENTISTS BELIEVE CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATED FROM LAB IN WUHAN, CHINA ""For every American who lost a loved one to COVID, every nurse and first responder who worked night and day to fight COVID and keep us safe, and every child who has faced a  mental health  emergency due to school closures and lockdowns, they deserve answers.""      
      Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., questions Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., during a House Energy and Commerce Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill on April 2, 2019, in Washington.
       (Zach Gibson/Getty Images) There are two competing theories of how COVID-19 started: naturally or through a lab release. Under the natural origin theory, the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, would have originated in an animal and traveled to humans either directly or through an intermediate host  animal .  Another theory is that the virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat coronaviruses and has engaged in risky gain-of-function research. The virus could have spread from a researcher accidentally getting infected during an experiment and then unleashing it into the community. Scientists  are not in agreement on the origins of the virus, while the U.S. intelligence community also could not draw conclusions on what started the global pandemic that has killed more than 5.8 million people worldwide. FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN Knowing the origins could help determine how to prevent future pandemics and also develop public policy to potentially hold China accountable for the global pandemic. And if risky lab research is associated with the creation of the novel coronavirus, then policymakers would have further motivation to regulate or potentially stop federal funding for gain-of-function research and make grantees more accountable.  While China is not cooperating and has denied the lab leak theory, investigators in the U.S. believe they can gain critical information from a New York-based company called EcoHealth Alliance, which received $117 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars, and has conducted research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to a Republican House aide.  U.S. money to EcoHealth Alliance has come from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other grant-making agencies.  The big focus has been on an NIH award of nearly $600,000 to EcoHealth that was then sub-awarded to the Wuhan Institute of Virology during the 2014-2019 period for bat coronavirus research NIH ACKNOWLEDGES US FUNDED GAIN-OF-FUNCTION AT WUHAN LAB, DESPITE FAUCI’S DENIALS Another concern is a  2018 grant proposal  EcoHealth Alliance president Peter Daszak sent to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for risky  research  on bat coronaviruses with the Wuhan Institute of Virology called Project DEFUSE. It called for engineering a  coronavirus  with a ""furin cleavage site"" that would be more infections to and transmissible via humans. The virus would then be released in bat caves where researchers would test the flying mammals with vaccines to see if they could cure the virus. NEW WUHAN COVID DOCS 'COMPLETELY CONTRADICT FAUCI' ON GAIN-OF-FUNCTION CLAIMS, EX-STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS DARPA denied the request, but critics suggest work continued in some fashion.   Republicans in the minority have been  shooting off a series of letters  to NIH, EcoHealth Alliance and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) demanding answers on what the U.S. government knows on the type of research U.S. taxpayers were funding indirectly at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Aside from FOIA results and third-party lawsuits, Republicans have been unable to shake loose many responses. A GOP committee aide said the government agencies have not been responsive and EcoHealth Alliance has been stonewalling.

       (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) If Republicans take back control of Congress they would have the power to set the agenda, hold hearings and issue subpoenas. There's a scenario where NIH and EcoHealth Alliance would have to turn over documents and respond to letters that Republicans say have gone ignored. Republicans could also compel EcoHealth Alliance leader Peter Daszak, who has strongly  pushed the natural origin theory , to testify before Congress and provide information to the American people, a Republican aide on the Energy and Commerce Committee told Fox News Digital. Regardless of whether the pandemic originated in the lab, Republicans say there needs to be more transparency on what kind of research U.S. taxpayer dollars have been funding.  HOUSE REPUBLICANS PRESS USAID ON $4.7M GRANT FOR ECOHEALTH ALLIANCE AMID COVID QUESTIONS Gain-of-function research involves extracting viruses from animals to artificially engineer in a laboratory to make them more transmissible and deadly to humans. The purpose of such research is to allow scientists to get ahead of the curve in developing treatments for certain infectious diseases.  But such research is controversial – and was subject to a U.S. funding moratorium in 2014 under the Obama administration – over concerns the risks of creating more dangerous pathogens outweighed the benefit to prepare for future outbreaks. The federal funding ban was lifted in 2017 with new guidelines.      
      House Oversight and Reform Committee Ranking Member James Comer, R-Ky., speaks during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on May 12, 2021, in Washington.
       (Jonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images) Kentucky Rep. James Comer, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said despite the Democrats' refusal to investigate the origins, Republicans have been still able to uncover important information, such as how  Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the White House's top medical adviser, was aware that NIH was funding the Wuhan lab for risky experimental research on bat coronaviruses and how Fauci ""may have acted to conceal the information and intentionally downplay the lab leak theory."" ""When Republicans are in power in 2023, we will use every tool at our disposal to get answers for the American people and hold accountable those who have shielded the truth,"" Comer told Fox News Digital. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and EcoHealth Alliance did not respond to Fox News' requests for comment. But the USAID says it has cooperated with Congress.  A USAID spokesperson outlined nearly $73 million EcoHealth Alliance has received in grants and subgrants from the federal government since 2009, on projects related to disease outbreaks, global health security and climate change. The biggest chunk of money was $64 million from 2009-2020 for health security capacity strengthening, risk communication activities, laboratory strengthening and virus detection work in coordination with partners in 12 countries. USAID said the work China ended in 2019. ""USAID has provided extensive documentation to Congress about awards and sub-awards to EcoHealth Alliance, has proactively and regularly briefed our oversight committees, and has responded to requests for information from other key Members of Congress,"" a USAID spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""USAID has not and does not fund gain-of-function research."" For its part, NIH continues to insist that its grant funding to EcoHealth Alliance that was then sub-awarded to the Wuhan Institute of Virology did not meet its definition of ""gain of function"" research. The NIH has said the research it funded could not have been the genesis of the coronavirus pandemic based on the genetic sequence of the virus.

       (REUTERS/Thomas Peter) ""NIH wants to set the record straight on NIH-supported research to understand naturally occurring bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, funded through a subaward from NIH grantee EcoHealth Alliance,"" former NIH Director Francis Collins  said in a statement  in October. "" Analysis  of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false."" Adding to the concern of congressional investigators are recently disclosed emails between virology experts and Fauci and Collins at the beginning of the pandemic. Scientists initially suggested COVID-19 came from a lab, but Fauci and Collins  appear to silence  those concerns in the emails.  Critics suspect the leading scientists had a professional interest in not provoking backlash over gain-of-function research and inviting further scrutiny into a possibility that a lab in Wuhan that has received funding from the United States could have engaged in manipulating coronaviruses that sparked a pandemic.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thomas DiNanno, the former acting assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, called the Fauci emails ""devastating.""

       (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Instead of raising the legitimate concern of a lab-leak origin with the Trump administration – which would carry significant national security and diplomatic ramifications – Fauci and his ""international club of virus experts"" pressed the natural origin theory and ""they covered it up,"" DiNanno told Fox News Digital. ""He and Collins did everything they could to bury the truth and to put their thumb on the scale that it was a natural origin. They were concerned [with] international harmony. Instead of playing public health expert, which was their role, they took on the job of the national security adviser, secretary of state and the president,"" said DiNanno, who  has spoken out publicly  about how State Department officials were warned not to pursue an investigation into COVID-19 origins. DiNanno has been pressing for Democrats to investigate and hold hearings.  ""It seems for whatever reason, the majority party considers the exploration of the origins to be a partisan attack or personal attack against Dr. Fauci. It's not. People sometimes lose the fact that he is both the president's coronavirus adviser and a senior official at the NIH, which looks like it was funding dangerous research with the Chinese government,"" he said.

Why Trudeau's 'temporary' state of emergency is a dangerous sign,David Marcus," February 16, 2022 10:47am EST","  close     Video   Canadian trucker slams Trudeau's 'totalitarian' leadership: He doesn't 'understand the working class'   Canadian trucker Jan Groen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Justin Trudeau invoking the Emergencies Act to cut off funding to the trucker protests. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   There are few things as freeing as an emergency. There are also few things as dangerous as an emergency.  For two years now, to varying degrees the people of the United States and  Canada  have been living under emergency rules. On Monday, in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced a new state of national emergency, not because of COVID this time, but because of the supposed threat posed by truckers protesting COVID restrictions. DAVID MARCUS: HOW JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S INCOMPETENCE REVVED UP A GLOBAL PROTEST     
      Outside the Parliament of Canada
       (Fox News Digital/Lisa Bennatan) In the 20th century freedom triumphed over both fascism and communism, in the 21th century the greatest threat to that freedom is not from such noxious ideologies, but rather from a permanent state of emergency. The illiberal condition of this state of emergency, which will feel familiar to Americans, is one in which the Canadian government may now ban public association and protest, seize the bank accounts of their critics, and revoke all manner of other civil liberties. The irony here is that the truckers are protesting emergency rule and Trudeau’s hapless answer is to introduce further emergency power. The Canadian government promises these new powers are temporary, one almost has to smile at how familiar that sounds.   Video I talked to Randy Hillier, member of Ontario’s Provincial Parliament, who put it this way, ""They’re using the sledgehammer to swat a fly, they're gonna miss the fly, you always do. And they’ll be great harm and collateral damage to everyone else, once again."" As I wandered around Parliament Hill in Ottawa it was hard to disagree with Hillier’s assessment. I saw tents where people were making breakfast, trucks in neat rows allowing traffic to pass by them, high-fives and hugs. What I did not see was any conceivable reason to invoke the modern equivalent of Canada’s War Powers Act. Sam and his friends were manning one of the food tents as they have been for three weeks now. Hearty thick rashers of bacon wafted their elegant aroma down Metcalfe street next to the open Starbucks. Of Trudeau he told me, ""He’s not sitting down having a beer with us, he’s dividing the country."" His friend, behind the Canadian flag scarf protecting his face from the bitter wind, added, ""It’s a power play.""   Video But not everyone in power is on board with this play. On Monday three premieres of Canadian provinces came out against invoking the Emergency Act. On Tuesday the police chief of Ottawa resigned, which protesters I spoke with viewed as a victory. Over the past two days there has been some consolidation of the trucks, opening more of the streets in Ottawa, though frankly it has not appeared that any traffic has been significantly impeded. That move seemed to be a result of conversations between the mayor and the protesters, and it underscores how effective a simple conversation, rather than emergency powers, can be in this situation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The fact of the matter is that what one sees with one’s own eyes here in the shadow of Parliament bears little resemblance to the ""insurrection"" cited by the Canadian government and the media it controls. Aside from being an example of why state-run news is an atrocious idea, this situation is extremely dangerous. A future in which special powers that curtail the most cherished rights of the people are invoked for fake emergencies is indeed one in which freedom cannot be said to exist. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For now, the truckers are not swayed or fearful of these new powers seized by Trudeau. If anything, erecting further emergency powers has only strengthened their resolve. Maybe the reason Trudeau has refused to take the simple step of negotiating to end the supposed crisis is that he doesn’t want the crisis to end. Maybe he enjoys the power. If so, it is hard to see how any of this can be resolved. And it is a harbinger of great danger to democracy. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS  "

   Republicans shredded Secretary of  Education  Miguel Cardona on  Twitter  this week after he said smiling faces was his reason for teaching despite his continued insistence that children wear masks in schools due to  COVID-19 . ""Today’s #LoveTeaching theme is ‘Tremendous Tuesday’ where we are challenged to tell a 6-word story that describes why you #LoveTeaching,"" Cardona tweeted to his 67,000 followers Tuesday.

""We are assessing the most important factors based on where we are in the pandemic, and we'll soon put guidance in place that is relevant and encourages prevention measures when they are most needed to protect public health and our hospitals.

The fourth quarter saw approximately 30.8 million visitors, a 7% increase when compared to the 29 million tourists that visited during the fourth quarter in 2019. DeSantis attributed these growing numbers to Florida’s lack of vaccine and mask mandates compared to more progressive states in the country. ""Who wants to travel some place when you want to get a hamburger you have to show your medical papers?"" DeSantis said ""In Florida, we don’t do that. We are not doing passports. We are not doing mandates."" Since the start of the pandemic,  Democrats  and their allies in the media have continuously  attacked  DeSantis for his COVID policies.

   White House chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  Dr. Anthony Fauci  on Wednesday said that future requirements for additional boosters or shots are being monitored, just days after he suggested that annual COVID-19 booster shots may not be needed for every American. ""The potential future requirement for an additional boost or a fourth shot for mRNA or a third shot for J&J is being very carefully monitored in real time.  And recommendations, if needed, will be updated according to the data as it evolves,"" Fauci said during a press briefing by the White House COVID-19 response team.  Fauci showed hospitalization data he said indicated booster shots are ""safe and well-tolerated."" He cited multiple studies of vaccine effectiveness which showed that, for those with a normal immune response, ""a single booster shot continues to provide high levels of protection against severe disease caused by omicron,"" he  added .  TEXAS SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER FEDERAL MASK MANDATE ON PLANES, IN AIRPORTS

   Babies born to mothers vaccinated against COVID-19 during pregnancy have less risk for hospitalization due to the virus, according to a new study by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC).   The study found that infants younger than six months old were 61% less likely to be hospitalized if their mothers received a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine, according to the report.  The CDC recommended that women who are trying to conceive, are pregnant or are breastfeeding get vaccinated after finding that mothers who are vaccinated are likely to pass on the immunity protection against the virus, the report said.  ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER IMMUNE SYSTEMS, STUDY SAYS

   Canadian truckers who have stood their ground at the U.S.- Canada  border — both physically and philosophically — have enthusiastic support from some big-rig drivers here in our country even as the police push in. Long and short-haul truckers rolling through cities and towns in both countries perform a ""sometimes dangerous, often hard"" job. They deserve everyone’s respect, two trucking company employees told Fox News Digital in separate phone interviews this week.

""It shows no respect for the enormous role truckers play in the economy — and it’s dictatorial."" Brubaker says  Canadian truckers  caught the world’s attention through their blockade.  ""You’ve got to be pretty smart to do that,"" he said. The Ottawa border protests began several weeks ago when truckers decided to take a stand and oppose Canada's new rule requiring them to be fully vaccinated against  COVID .

The truckers are only trying to get the Canadian government to reconsider the mandate and ""listen to the people it actually affects,"" he said.

   The family of a fourth-grade elementary school student in  New Jersey  told Fox News Digital that their daughter, Maci Young, was put into an adjoining room next to the nurse's office recently when the child would not  wear a mask  at school. After the incident, their daughter was sent home from school that day. The student had politely declined to put a mask on her face when teachers asked her to do so — but, according to the family, that didn't matter.  Now, after the incident in late January, the student has sent an essay she wrote about mask-wearing to  N.J. Gov. Phil Murphy.  Among the points she makes in her piece: ""I don't want to wear the mask anymore. It hurts and I don't learn a lot now because my teacher keeps telling people to pull up their masks."" CT FAMILY SHARES ‘HEARTBREAKING’ IMPACT OF MASK MANDATES As  COVID-19 infections  have declined across the country, many state and local leaders have been loosening the related restrictions or removing them entirely. In the Garden State, however, kids must still wear masks at school — for now. ""I was trying to stand up for what I believe in,"" Maci Young, the fourth-grade student at Robert Hunter Elementary School in Raritan Township, N.J., told Fox News Digital this week through her mother, Chelsea Young.

       (Chelsea Young) ""I didn’t like [being isolated and sent home for choosing not to wear a mask] because I never get in trouble at school,"" the student also said. Chelsea Young had instructed her daughter how to respectfully decline wearing a mask while at school — and the girl did exactly as her mother said.  Young said her daughter responded ""no, thank you,"" when a staff member asked her to put on a mask at school. But that led to issues. ‘Outrageous' incident Staff members reportedly isolated Maci Young in a room adjacent to the nurse’s office after the student arrived at school on January 25 and politely declined to wear a mask.  Young said the family then received a call from the school telling them to come pick up their daughter, who could be heard crying in the background. Chelsea Young rushed to the school to pick up her child and described the incident as ""outrageous."" BOSTON-AREA MARINE VETERAN, BLINDED BY HIS MASK, SUFFERS BRUISING FALL ""There’s a zero-tolerance [policy] for bullying, but the teachers just did that to her. Not because they wanted to, but because they are forced to by our governor,"" Young told Fox News Digital.   The mom emphasized she did not blame the teachers.  ""Maci tried to take a stand for herself. And for a fourth grader, I think she did it extremely responsibly and handled the situation way better than some adults do. But she was punished for that."" ""Kids should be able to stand up for themselves, too,"" Maci Young said.  Fox News Digital asked the school superintendent about staff protocols when students don't wear masks, as well as about this specific situation. The superintendent forwarded a letter with general mandate-related guidance and information that was sent out to district families. Through a spokesperson, she also said the district does not comment ""on personnel or student matters."" Chelsea Young said she was told the incident with her daughter would be marked as an unexcused absence in the records. But after checking the school’s Parent Portal on February 15, Young said the incident hadn't been logged as such, as of this writing. Time to write a letter After Maci Young was sent home, she was upset about what happened and decided to write a letter expressing her feelings.  She detailed all the reasons she believed mask-wearing was causing her more harm than good.  NJ 3-YEAR-OLD KICKED OUT OF SPEECH THERAPY FOR NOT WEARING A MASK: ‘CATASTROPHIC MORAL CRIME’   The student, who hopes to be an art teacher when she grows up, sent her letter to the Flemington-Raritan School District’s superintendent, Dr. Kari McGann; to her principal; and to the school board.  Her letter was published on February 12 in a local news outlet, TAPInto. Dr. McGann, the superintendent, encouraged Maci Young to send the letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, Chelsea Young told Fox News Digital.

""I think she did a great job explaining why she didn’t want to wear a mask.""  Younger brother Easton said he, too, is proud of his sister, the family said.

Young added.  Young said she contacted their pediatrician about her daughter’s symptoms.      
      Maci Young, at right, with her brother. In the letter the fourth grader sent to Gov. Phil Murphy, she wrote, ""I hope that one day school will go back to being fun because I am only a kid once.""
       (Chelsea Young) Based on her mother’s description of the symptoms, the doctor’s office suggested the family come in, so that the doctor's office could provide a note excusing the child from wearing a mask.  But the next morning, the doctor’s office declined to write the exemption, Young told Fox News Digital, citing newly issued guidance from the governor’s office that deemed kids with symptoms like Maci’s ineligible. (There is no independent evidence that the masking caused the student's headaches.) ‘Gets to be a normal kid again’  On Monday, Feb. 14, at Flemington-Raritan School District’s board meeting, the board voted on a change to its mandatory indoor masking policy.  Chelsea Young and her daughter were present at the meeting but did not get to speak (the comments period of the meeting went long). Barring any executive order or state mandate to the contrary, mask-wearing at FRSD schools will soon be optional — beginning March 7 — according to a letter about the issue that Superintendent McGann forwarded to Fox News Digital.  In accordance with the CDC’s guidance, however, students will still be required to wear masks when they ride the bus to and from school. On Wed., Feb. 16, 2022, during a briefing, CDC Director Rachel Walensky said, ""We are assessing the most important factors based on where we are in the pandemic, and we'll soon put guidance in place that is relevant and encourages prevention measures when they are most needed …"" Mom Chelsea Young said she considers the imminent changes in New Jersey a partial win. For her daughter, however, it's larger than that. ""This is a win. [She will] get to be a normal kid again,"" said the mom.     
      Maci Young of N.J. recently competed down in Florida with her local cheer squad. The team took third place in the competition — and did not have to wear masks in Orlando, Florida.
       (Chelsea Young) The fourth grader said that one of her teachers came up to her, gave her a hug, and told her she ""did an incredible job [with her letter]."" Said Chelsea Young about her daughter, ""Maci feels a lot better knowing she can express herself in the right ways and have the support of her teachers.""

       (Boris Roessler/dpa via AP) The biggest number of new COVID-19 cases was seen in Russia. Cases there and elsewhere in Eastern Europe doubled in recent weeks, driven by a surge of the hugely infectious omicron variant. WHO said that all other coronavirus variants, including alpha, beta and delta, continue to decline globally as omicron crowds them out. Among the more than 400,000 COVID-19  virus  sequences uploaded to the world’s biggest virus database in the last week, more than 98% were omicron. MOTHER VACCINATED AGAINST COVID DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE RISK OF INFANTS BEING HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID-19 WHO said the BA.2 version of omicron appears to be ""steadily increasing"" and its prevalence has risen in South Africa, Denmark, the U.K. and other countries. Health officials have noted, however, that omicron causes milder disease than previous COVID-19 variants and in countries with high vaccination rates, hospitalization and death rates have not increased substantially, even with omicron’s spread.

Estimated 73% of US immune to omicron: Is it enough?,Associated Press," February 17, 2022 1:04pm EST","  close     Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for February 17   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The  omicron wave  that assaulted the United States this winter also bolstered its defenses, leaving enough protection against the coronavirus that future spikes will likely require much less — if any — dramatic disruption to society. Millions of individual Americans’ immune systems now recognize the  virus  and are primed to fight it off if they encounter omicron, or even another variant. About half of eligible Americans have received booster shots , there have been nearly 80 million confirmed infections overall and many more infections have never been reported. One influential model uses those factors and others to estimate that 73% of Americans are, for now, immune to omicron, the dominant variant, and that could rise to 80% by mid-March. This will prevent or shorten new illnesses in protected people and reduce the amount of virus circulating overall, likely tamping down new waves. Hospitals will get a break from overwhelmed ICUs, experts agree. CDC, WHITE HOUSE ANTICIPATING TIME WHEN COVID-19 ISN'T A CRISIS AS PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS LOOSENED ""We have changed,"" said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in  Seattle . ""We have been exposed to this virus and we know how to deal with it."" The coronavirus — the current variant or  future ones  that are sure to pop up — remains a dangerous germ. It is still infecting more than 130,000 Americans and killing more than 2,000 every day. Tens of millions of people remain vulnerable. And there will be  future outbreaks . The notion of a ""herd immunity"" that could stop the virus has slipped away under the harsh reality of new variants, waning immunity, and the rejection of vaccines by some Americans. But the coronavirus is no longer new. Two years ago it arrived in a nation where nobody’s immune system had seen it before. The entire population — 330 million people — were immunologically naive, that is, susceptible to infection.     
      People wait in line to test for COVID-19 on Wednesday, Jan. 12, 2022, in Long Beach, Calif. 
       (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) ""I am optimistic even if we have a surge in summer, cases will go up, but hospitalizations and deaths will not,"" said Mokdad, who works on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model, which calculated the 73% figure for The Associated Press. With varying degrees of relief and caution, many Americans are starting to return to their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Sarah Rixen, 41, of  Bismarck, North Dakota , started singing again with a civic chorus after taking a year off. Now, with omicron winding down, she said she feels more confident than at any time since the crisis began. ""But I am still a little leery that there could be another variant around the corner,"" said Rixen, noting that her family and most of her relatives are fully  vaccinated . ""I am still going to wear a mask."" As  mask mandates  ease, workers return to  offices  and flights fill up, experts are trying to understand whether this return to normal can last, or if another setback is looming. To address that, researchers are trying to answer questions about the virus, the vaccine, and how our bodies respond: How fast is booster protection waning against omicron? How long does protection from  infection  last? How many mild infections were never reported? How many people got infected but had no symptoms? To find clues, they use health data from other countries such as Britain, Denmark, South Africa and Qatar to project what could be in store. WHO REPORTS NEW COVID-19 CASES DROP BY 19% GLOBALLY Scientists  at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health estimate that about three out of four people in the United States will have been infected by  omicron  by the end of the surge. ""We know it’s a huge proportion of the population,"" said Shaun Truelove, an epidemiologist and disease modeler at Johns Hopkins. ""This varies a lot by location, and in some areas we expect the number infected to be closer to one in two."" That means different regions or groups of people have different level of protection — and risk. In  Virginia , disease modelers are thinking about their population in terms of groups with different levels of immunity. They estimate about 45% of Virginians have the highest level of immunity through boosted vaccination or through vaccination plus a recent infection with omicron. Another 47% have immunity that has waned somewhat; and 7% are the most vulnerable because they were never vaccinated and never infected. In all, the vast majority of Virginians have at least some immunity, said Bryan Lewis, a computational epidemiologist who leads University of Virginia’s COVID-19 modeling team.   Video ""That’s going to be a nice shield of armor for our population as a whole,"" Lewis said. ""If we do get to very low case rates, we certainly can ease back on some of these restrictions."" Still, while the population is better protected, many individuals are not. Even by the most optimistic estimates for population immunity, 80 million or so Americans are still vulnerable. That’s about the same as the total number of confirmed infections in the U.S. during the pandemic. ""The 26% who could still get omicron right now have to be very careful,"" Mokdad said. Andrew Pekosz, a virus researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is concerned that people — particularly unvaccinated omicron survivors — may have a false sense of security. ""In an ideal world, unvaccinated individuals infected with omicron would be lining up for a vaccine shot,"" he said.

Protection varies widely from person to person. And it’s impossible to know for sure how many people are protected at all. The IHME model estimates a wide range — from 63% to 81% of Americans. ""We’ve reached a much better position for the coming months, but with waning immunity we shouldn’t take it for granted,"" Mokdad said.  "

Pennsylvania's Supreme Court  struck down  a statewide school mask mandate supported by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Acting State Health Secretary Alison Beam Friday.

This is how Canada's trucker convoy could end,David Marcus," February 17, 2022 2:00pm EST","  close     Video   Justin Trudeau threatens to begin arresting Freedom Convoy protesters   Canadian trucker Harold Jonker on Trudeau's threats to make arrests as truck drivers continue to protest for medical freedom NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   There is a familiar dynamic to government protests that is normally as regular as clockwork. Protesters will exaggerate the size and scope of their actions, while the government will attempt to downplay it. That was how the trucker convoy in  Ottawa, Canada ’s capital, began 3 weeks ago.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mocked the protesters as a small, fringe element. But as the protest continues, both sides now have an interest in making what is happening seem bigger than it truly is. DAVID MARCUS: WHY TRUDEAU's ‘TEMPORARY’ STATE OF EMERGENCY IS A DANGEROUS SIGN     
      Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrives to a news conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada February 14, 2022. REUTERS/Blair Gable
       Part of the issue here is that huge trucks take up a lot, and I mean, A LOT of space. Aside from weekends when Wellington street in front of Parliament becomes a fairly large dance party, there are rarely more than one or two hundred protesters in what Trudeau calls the ""occupation"" of Ottawa. Two hundred freezing and friendly people does not an occupation make. Even if the big rigs make it seem so. At the beginning of this week it appeared that rational voices on both sides might have been reaching a conclusion to the ""crisis."" Across Canada, COVID restrictions were being relaxed, the mayor of Ottawa was meeting with the truckers, and the latter’s footprint in the city was being consolidated and reduced. But that was before Justin Trudeau decided to go nuclear.   Video Prior to Trudeau’s absurd and dangerous invocation of Canada’s Emergency Act the end game seemed clear. Restrictions would continue to fall as the convoy reduced its size and both sides would declare a victory. The truckers for forcing the government’s hand, the government for ending the protest. Now that possibility has become deeply complicated. Aside from the trucks lining the streets in a limited area of Ottawa there is another sight worth mentioning. The stores nearby are mainly closed, but tellingly, none are boarded up. Last year during left wing protests in Toronto, stores boarded up as they had in 2020 in the United States. This wasn’t a government order in either case. It was a precaution taken by the businesses themselves, that has not happened in Ottawa because there is no threat.   Video It’s an important giveaway, one that strongly suggests Trudeau and his government have intentionally overplayed the danger presented by the truckers. The government claims Ottawans are being harassed. The only example I saw of that was a well-dressed woman walking by a group of protesters who yelled, ""It’s not a protest, it’s an occupation!"" over and over. It felt exactly like people screaming at those not wearing masks. An under noted but important aspect of all of this is that to the extent the area impacted is residential – it is very high end. The Zoom class professionals who live there don’t seem to like lowly truckers on their streets.   Video The problem with easing tensions now, calming both the truckers and the well-to-do professionals who live in the tony district near Parliament, is in fact the Emergency Act. What was likely before, and is generally how protests end, is that most of the truckers and their allies would disperse leaving a hard core group willing to be arrested for their stance. But today, instead of being arrested for some minor protesting charge, the truckers are looking at up to five years in prison and losing their livelihood. Even far-flung supporters who gave small donations are in Trudeau’s crosshairs. For the leaders of the convoy, their potential arrests may no longer be symbolic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Trudeau has backed the truckers into a corner, leading some to opine that he is courting catastrophe for political gain, though it's hard to see that he is gaining much of anything as his opponents drown him out in Parliament while his allies sit on their hands. Maybe he is just bad at this, maybe his actions are more nefarious. There seem to be two main options as to how this can end now. One is mass arrests and removal of the trucks. On Wednesday, Ottawa police handed out fliers promising just such a thing. The other option is that the protest eventually withers along with the COVID restrictions in Canada. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Those truly in favor of peace and safety should pray for a light touch from the government, but ominous signs portend that will not be the case. So far, there has been nothing that can truly be called an emergency in Ottawa, but Trudeau’s unprecedented Emergency Act may change that. There is still time for a calm settlement of the situation, but the clock, as they say, is ticking. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS  "

But what this says to me is that there was a silent majority of parents that were incredibly frustrated, outraged that schools were closed for seven months, and they showed up, and they voted in the special election to recall in a really, truly decisive manner. And I think this is causing people to rethink party alignment. You know, for me, it's not even about party. I'm going to vote for candidates that support the causes that I care about.  WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:   Video  "

   The  COVID-19 pandemic  has hit women hard. At Women’s March, where I serve as executive director, we know this firsthand. We feel it in our own lives. We see and hear it from our millions of members in all 50 states.  Women in America are not all right. And the  politicians  tasked with making our lives better,  on both sides of the aisle,  all too often only make things worse – ignoring us, lying to us, or speaking for us instead of simply helping.    Video Our organization has talked at length about the ways Republican officials have hurt women recently: rejecting paid family and medical leave, blocking minimum wage increases, and quashing access to reproductive health care, to name just a few. (Not to mention the  undermining-trust-in-our-vaccines  and attempting-to-overturn-our-elections things…) We’ll keep talking, writing, marching and even running for office until we get the change we need. WHY A LAWSUIT OVER FORCED MASKING OF OUR CHILDREN IN VIRGINIA IS NECESSARY But at Women’s March, our fight isn’t red versus blue. It’s a fight  for  the 51% of our population being left behind by leaders who lack political courage and refuse to do their jobs. And here, Democrats are guilty, too.  In some instances, they haven’t fought hard enough to keep their promises. In other instances, though, Democrats have fought too hard (and for too long) for the wrong things – and women have suffered the consequences.  School closures are one example.      
      A ""closed"" sign in front of a public elementary school in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in March 2020.
       (iStock) When the pandemic first hit, we literally didn’t know better. After all, children and young adults were among the hardest hit during the last pandemic, the 1918 Spanish Flu. When we didn’t know if COVID-19 would act similarly, closing schools made sense. It was the right decision.  But just a few months in, we knew this wasn’t the case. By June 2020, the American Academy of Pediatrics was already advocating for a return to safe, in-person school ,  noting that the benefits for kids – academic, physical and mental – outweighed the risks. And that was  before  vaccines were even developed, much less widely and freely available. Still, many Democratic cities and states kept schools closed for another year. And during more recent COVID spikes, too many have been too quick to shut them down again.  From mental health to math scores to simply eating a good meal, school closures failed the kids they were supposed to protect.   This isn’t to discount staffing shortages, especially this January, that left some schools with no choice other than to temporarily close doors. And it isn’t to blame teachers, who are mostly women, who’ve done God’s work during the pandemic, and whose concerns for themselves and their students are real.  Still, the impact on children – particularly the most disadvantaged – has been devastating. From mental health to math scores to simply eating a good meal, school closures failed the kids they were supposed to protect. It’s true that Black and Latino parents were most hesitant to send their children back to school, for very real current and historic reasons. But every family should have had a choice – and every school should have been given necessary resources to open safely. (What actually happened: schools in communities hit hardest by COVID often had the  fewest  resources to combat it.)   Video No wonder moms exited – or, really, were ejected from – the workforce in droves over the past two years. In September 2020 and 2021, a combined 1,172,000 women left their jobs. It’s no coincidence these mass-career-casualties coincided with the start of school years, when virtual learning was either status quo or used regularly as a backup.  Then there are the women who could never afford to stop working – especially outside the home. For millions who couldn’t go remote, especially the essential workers we hailed as heroes, school closures didn’t mean worrying about kids wandering into the background of Zoom meetings. They meant leaving a 6-year-old home alone, hoping she wouldn’t burn the apartment down trying to make herself grilled cheese for lunch. Or they meant bringing that 6-year-old to work so she could access Wi-Fi from Taco Bell’s parking lot.    Video Today, it’s clear as daylight. While closing schools isn’t always a mistake, the politicians who promoted and perpetuated school closures, especially recently, were by and large mistaken. Fortunately, with the omicron surge subsiding, most kids are back in classrooms. And many women – though not all – are back at work. So why bring this up now? Why not just move on? Because Women’s March doesn’t pledge allegiance to any political party or its elites – even one that claims to fight for working families and communities of color. Our allegiance is to women. And women,  especially  from working families and communities of color, have suffered the brunt of the past two years and the school closures they’ve normalized.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It’s important to say so – loudly and clearly. After all, if we’re not honest when leaders harm us, if we don’t have the courage to tell them they’re wrong, we’re all but asking them to do it again.  And school closures are a mistake we can’t afford to repeat.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "

Andrew Cuomo  in the early months of the  pandemic .  ALLISON GOLLUST RESIGNS FROM CNN FOLLOWING JEFF ZUCKER OUSTER   However, a new report from The New York Times alleges Gollust, who previously worked for Cuomo as a communications aide, forwarded topics the governor wanted to discuss for a CNN interview in March 2020, a revelation from the network's internal investigation.  ""CNN’s longtime chief of communications and marketing and a former top aide of the governor, passed along the topics to CNN producers and then reported back to the governor. ‘Done,’ she wrote,"" the Times reported Friday.

Following the announcement of Zucker's resignation, Gollust issued her own statement suggesting their relationship ""changed during Covid."" ""Ms. Gollust’s decision to put a timeline on the evolution of the relationship rankled some employees at WarnerMedia and CNN, who believed it had turned romantic before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to some of the people familiar with the matter,"" WSJ  reported  on Friday.  CNN TURMOIL: MSNBC KEEPS UP BLACKOUT OF RIVAL'S CHRIS CUOMO, JEFF ZUCKER SCANDALS ""Allison has been clear that her relationship with Jeff changed during Covid, and regrets that they didn’t properly disclose it to WarnerMedia at that time.

   This past weekend, the  Super Bowl  enlightened us not just because the Bengals tragically lost in the last minute of the big game, but because we saw a false pretense, a façade of virtuous character among our leaders and lawmakers insisting we mask up. But yet they don’t conform to their own social and moral standards. Leaders lead by setting an example for others. But when that doesn’t happen, we lose trust, respect, and credibility – while simultaneously forcing children to cover their faces all day long in  school,  which at this point is harmful to our kids. VIRAL VIDEO SHOWS CHILDREN REJOICING AFTER LEARNING THEY NO LONGER NEED TO MASK UP IN SCHOOL Is it really that bad? Yes. At this time, masking children is more harmful than  COVID  itself for most children, the lowest risk group who have a near-zero mortality rate from coronavirus – 0.24% to be exact.   Video When children cover their faces, they cover their personalities, their expressions. Facial expressions are the most vital and valuable aspect of human to human communication and interaction - the way a child conveys his thoughts, emotions, ideas, intentions. Their face indicates physical or psychological distress and that’s not to mention nonverbal communication expressing fear, anger sadness, or pain, all of which impacts social engagement, growth, personality, confidence, and behavior. It makes me wonder whether alterations or deprivation of these necessities at an early age will be responsible for  mental illness  later in life. CHILDREN AREN'T AS GOOD AT RECOGNIZING MASKED FACES AS ADULTS, STUDY FINDS Covering a child’s face is closing the window to a child’s mental and physical state, dampening their personality, cognitive processes and hindering their emotions and enculturation. In the words of psychologist Silvan Tomkins, ""the face is the seat of emotion."" And whether a child expresses excitement or anguish, it must be acknowledged, but this is not possible with the only eyes exposed due to mask coverage of 80% of a child’s face.  We cannot wear masks in perpetuity.   I’ve had patients come in with worsening speech impediments, rashes and infections on the face, eye infections from fiddling with their masks and touching their eyes and nose. The  World Health Organization  does not recommend masking for children under age 5 and only optional for those ages 6 to 11. This begs the question as to why the U.S. guidance is outdated and obsolete, especially at a time when hospitalizations and cases have plummeted by over 80%. Yet we have not updated our policy and guidelines to reflect such even though we’ve achieved our goals, accomplished our mission. We ""flattened the curve,"" but protocols have not been appropriately modified.   Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER There is no solid concrete data that indicates significant benefit to masking a toddler. I see firsthand the detrimental impact it has on our children. The burden of protection is placed on our children, the least vulnerable and lowest risk population. This defies truth, it defies logic, it defies science. The backward protocol needs to be lifted. Current policies are obsolete and must be modified accordingly. We cannot wear masks in perpetuity. It should be an option, a choice for anyone. COVID is no longer an emergency. We have come to a point in time where cases are gone: In my last shift Wednesday night, of all my sick patients, I only had one positive case.

We just need to have countries not do this all-or-nothing approach because it's confusing, and I don't blame anyone that's out there that is confused.

       ""From the data points on religious accommodations for the COVID-19 vaccine that I have received, it is clear that DOD leaders are ignoring the sincerely-held religious beliefs of service members,"" Lankford  wrote . ""Until a few weeks ago, the U.S. military had not approved a single religious accommodation request across all branches,"" the senator continued. ""Since then, the Department has informed me they have approved twelve requests—all granted to service members who are already planning to separate from their service—out of thousands of requests."" Lankford pointed out that the Army ""still has not granted a single permanent religious accommodation despite thousands of requests"" and that given ""DOD’s track record, it is not unreasonable to presume these adjudications were made in an attempt to establish an outward perception of a just process in response to public outrage, rather than the result of credible analysis.""

""Examples shared with my office misapply U.S. law and discredit the sincerity of religious beliefs."" the letter reads. ""In one denial reply shared by a Marine, the Commanding Officer stated that requiring the COVID-19 vaccine ‘does not substantially burden your sincerely held religious belief.’"" ""Commanding Officers with no legal or spiritual training have no right to dictate what substantially burdens a service member’s sincerely held religious belief. The Department has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to accommodate religious exercise, even exercise with which it disagrees or views as negligible,"" Lankford wrote. ""DOD does not have the legal authority to second guess the reasonableness of a religious belief or the service member’s assessment of the religious connection between the mandate and his or her underlying belief.""

Lankford’s letter comes after a Navy Reserve chaplain said earlier this month that the military is being used by the Biden administration as a ""nice little test group"" that ""can't say no"" after he said he was denied a religious exemption to the  COVID-19  vaccine.

   Will U.S. residents need a fourth shot of a  COVID-19   vaccine ?  With a surge of the omicron variant of the coronavirus subsiding around the country, questions continue to swirl about the future of the pandemic in the United States.  While cases and hospitalizations are down, deaths remain high, exceeding past pandemic peaks.  FAUCI SAYS FUTURE REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL COVID-19 BOOSTERS BEING MONITORED White House  and public health leaders have said that they are cautiously optimistic about current trends and  planning for a return to normal . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently considering revising its guidance on masking. To date,  data from the agency  shows 92.6 million Americans have received a booster shot of a COVID-19 vaccine and 214.6 million are fully vaccinated.  While the Biden administration has called on the U.S. to stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations,  health experts  continue to worry about impending variants of concern and that booster rates are too low given that the vaccination's efficacy wanes over time – about after four months.      
      Children 12-15 years old receive a Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on January 6, 2022. 
       (JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) The CDC says COVID-19 vaccine booster shots provide  90% protection against hospitalization . National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director  Dr. Anthony Fauci   told PBS last week  that while there is ""substantial waning"" for symptomatically recognizable disease, for severe disease at four to five months there is still about a 78% overall protection rate against hospitalization. He said that number is ""pretty good,"" which is why the CDC is instructing those who are immune-comprised to get their fourth shot now – but that those who are in the general population of immunocompetent people are ""pretty good"" as the CDC works to follow the durability of that protection.  MASK MANDATES TO BE LIFTED IN NEW MEXICO, WASHINGTON ""If it goes down over the next couple of months, then they will modify the recommendation of when and who should get now the fourth shot. But, in general, for the population level, 78% is pretty good. It likely will go down sometime. We don't know for sure. We're hoping it'll hold tight up there,"" he said. ""But, if it does go down, I think you can expect some modification of the recommendation."" Speaking at the White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing , the president's chief medical adviser said that the potential future requirement for ""an additional boost or a fourth shot for mRNA or a third shot for J&J is being very carefully monitored in real time. "" ""And, recommendations, if needed, will be updated according to the data as it evolves,"" he pledged.    Video Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Dr. Peter Marks  told The New York Times  that scientists ""simply don’t have enough data to know that it’s a good thing to do."" The best time for an additional shot could come in the fall, he explained to the publication on Thursday. ""Barring any surprises from new variants, maybe the best thing is to think about our booster strategy in conjunction with the influenza vaccine next fall, and get as many people as possible boosted then,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Currently, the CDC  recommends booster shots for everyone 12 years and older , five months after getting two doses of the mRNA vaccines or two months after a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Vaccines remain the best way to protect against COVID-19 and  everyone five years and older  is now eligible to receive a vaccine. The Associated Press contributed to this report.  "
"Stelter addresses past communication between Gollust, Gov. Cuomo, potential lawsuits: 'A legal mess for CNN'",Hanna Panreck," February 20, 2022 3:16pm EST","  close     Video   CNN's Brian Stelter reads Allison Gollust's statement on Jeff Zucker resignation   CNN’s ‘Reliable Sources’ host Brian Stelter reads a statement from Allison Gollust, the company’s head of marketing and romantic partner of Jeff Zucker. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Host of ""Reliable Sources"" Brian Stelter said Sunday the situation involving the resignations of former CNN president  Jeff Zucker  and former CNN marketing chief Allison Gollust was ""a legal mess for CNN."" ""I was told by a source that Zucker can't comment further on the substance of why he left why he did and what happened,"" Stelter said. ""Everybody is lawyer-ed up, Chris Cuomo might sue, Cuomo's lawyer apparently wants tens of millions of dollars out of this network, so this is now a legal mess for CNN."" Panelist Joe Peyronnin, a former vice president of CBS News, agreed with Stelter and argued that it could have been avoided.      
      Jeff Zucker was beloved by many CNN underlings who often referred to him simply as ""JZ."" (J. Countess/Getty Images)
       Stelter noted earlier in the segment that reports from The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both offered somewhat different accounts of what happened, adding later that they did not necessarily contradict each other.  Gollust resigned from CNN after their parent company, WarnerMedia, discovered a previous statement that she made about her relationship with Zucker was misleading, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gollust originally said her and Zucker's relationship ""changed during COVID."" Some CNN and WarnerMedia employees reportedly believed their  relationship  was romantic prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wall Street Journal reported that people familiar with the matter then determined her original statement was misleading.  WHO IS ALLISON GOLLUST? CNN BOSS ZUCKER STEPS DOWN CITING UNDISCLOSED RELATIONSHIP WITH LONGTIME COLLEAGUE WarnerMedia chief executive released a statement earlier in the week after Gollust's resignation.      
      John Griffin worked closely with former CNN star Chris Cuomo. 
       (CNN) ""Based on interviews of more than 40 individuals and a review of over 100,000 texts and emails, the investigation found violations of Company policies, including CNN's News Standards and Practices, by Jeff Zucker, Allison Gollust, and Chris Cuomo,"" the statement said. The New York Times reported that the standards and practices violation was about conversations Gollust had with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y. She had also previously worked for Cuomo before assuming her position at CNN and was the personal booker for the governor, according to Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Gollust.  The Times alleges that Andrew Cuomo told Gollust about topics he wanted to be asked about during his March 2020 live interview. She reportedly brought the topics to the producers at CNN and then got back to the governor. ""Done,"" she said, according to the Times. Zucker was reportedly aware of the communications between Gollust and Andrew Cuomo.  CHRIS CUOMO A ‘DESPISED FIGURE’ WITHIN CNN AT THIS POINT AS FALLOUT CONTINUES OVER HIS FIRING: INSIDER ""It is definitely unusual that the head of PR was involved in booking Cuomo and relaying information back and forth,"" Stelter said.      
      New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks during the daily media briefing on June 12, 2020, in New York City.
       (Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) The ""Reliable Sources"" host said that a statement from Gollust's spokesperson said it was ""well known by the entire network,"" was not true. Stelter said that the CNN anchors that he spoke with were surprised by what was reported by the New York Times. Mara Schiavocampo, a former ABC and NBC News correspondent, said that Gollust's communications with the governor don't come close to ""being unethical or even unusual."" She said it was common for someone being interviewed to request to talk about certain subjects. Schiavocampo said it was also common to grant them that, but that making the interview ""conditional on those things"" or ""agreeing not to ask about certain things"" would be unethical.  ""Maybe we don't know the full story yet,"" she said.  ""In terms of Allison and in terms of sharing questions and all that, we don't know everything that was shared. We don't know what was said, what Cuomo the governor said to her. To avoid that, why have her in the process, knowing that she was working with him,"" Peyronnin said.  He said that major news networks do have rules with regard to interviews. ""They do not allow you to share questions, they do not allow you to take any questions from whoever the subject is,"" he said, noting that you can mention the subject area. ""You cannot provide questions. That is a rule because you don't want anything to damage potentially the quality of the interview,"" he said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "

As the country opens up anew this year, he's looking forward to ""getting out and playing for people again."" His new album, ""Coldwater, Tennessee,"" releases on April 22, 2022. Two singles from it are out shortly. 
       (Mike Dunn) The native of Springfield,  Missouri,  chatted with Fox News Digital before getting out on the road again this year after COVID-19 interrupted a busy touring schedule.  How busy, one might ask? In 2019, Dallas Wayne did 110 gigs. In 2020, because of  lockdowns  and restrictions, he was able to do just  three .  Prior to ""Coldwater, Tennessee,"" Wayne's most recent album was ""Songs the Jukebox Taught Me, Volume 2,"" which came out in June 2018 on the Heart of Texas Records label.  Throughout his career, Dallas Wayne has done commercial voiceovers for TV and radio, including for  United Airlines, Delta Airlines , Oldsmobile,  Chevrolet,  Ford, Suzuki,  McDonald's , Nintendo, Miller Brewing Co., Old El Paso and Avis Rental Cars. He's also a broadcaster on Sirius XM’s Willie’s Roadhouse channel.  In an interview, Wayne shared a selection of life lessons and observations. Fox News Digital:  You've toured all across the country and much of the world. What stands out in your mind about people you've encountered along the way?  Dallas Wayne:  People are pretty much the same. They want to raise their  families , they want to be safe and secure in their homes, they want to have a roof over their heads, and they want to have a future. Those things are universal. As soon as we realize that people are all the same, all over the world — that people basically have the same wants, needs and desires — the sooner we'll get along with everybody. And get an understanding of folks. Fox News Digital:  Share an unusual encounter or two you might've had in your career over the years. Wayne:  There have been a lot, of course — some funny ones, too.  One night I was playing in Switzerland, and a lady came up to me with a bouquet of flowers. She brought them up to the stage and handed them up to me, and I said, ""Oh, thank you. They smell wonderful!""  And she said, ""They’re plastic, you idiot!""  I didn’t know quite what to say after that [laughing] — and I was right in the middle of a song. Those kinds of interactions are interesting. Another time, the father of one of my longtime radio listeners had gone into  hospice . And she had on the Willie’s Roadhouse channel 24/7 for him — the channel I work for on Sirius XM.  It was her dad's favorite channel, and I was kind of getting reports [about the listener's dad] throughout the day. She told me he would smile when I played this song or that song. Being right there in the middle of a situation like that, even though it was remote — that meant a lot.  You have to treat those kinds of situations with a certain amount of importance. Music is a universal language to people. Music means things to people.  DON MCLEAN: ‘I DID THE RIGHT THING WITH MY LIFE’ It’s important to people, no matter what genre it is.  I’ve played all over the world, thankfully, and I've never had any problems communicating with people musically. The only times I've ever had issues communicating around the globe was when I've been in restaurants trying to order supper!     
      Dallas Wayne during a performance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. ""Music is a universal language to people,"" he said. ""Music means things to people."" One of the singles off his new album this year is ""I Hit The Road (And The Road Hit Back),"" out on Feb. 25, 2022. 
       (Grand Ole Opry) Fox News Digital:  In this new year of 2022, how much is your schedule opening up again? Wayne:  I’m getting out more this year as things have gotten a little better. [The pandemic has] been a blow to everybody in the touring business, not just the artists themselves but the musicians, crew members and others. It’s been tough for them to survive over the last couple of years. Some artists have changed the work they do, and some have announced they’re not going to tour anymore. They spent the last year-and-a-half at home and realized how much they missed their families and how much they loved it.  TONY ROBBINS GETS REAL ABOUT SUCCESS IN LIFE AND HEALTH: 'JUST THINKING POSITIVE IS B.S.' The one silver lining — if there has been one through all of COVID — is that it's given people a chance to reassess and take stock of their world.  Usually we’re so busy all the time. Then, suddenly, we’re not.  For me, I was able to relocate from Austin, Texas, to Bristol, Tennessee. For a year I worked on this 130-year-old house that we bought.  And I've finally gotten all the boxes unpacked, every single box. Usually, when I move, I'd take stuff through three or four moves, and I'd finally open up the boxes. This time, we were able to get settled into a new place and a new way of life.     
      A native of Missouri, Dallas Wayne is a singer, songwriter, radio DJ, voiceover artist, actor and music producer. He began performing professionally while in school; in Nashville, he developed his vocal style. His second single from the new album comes out March 25; it's called ""He Even Brought Her Flowers"" and it's a duet with country singer-songwriter Bill Anderson. 
       (George Brainard) Fox News Digital:  Tell us about Bristol, Tennessee: Had you been wanting to move there for some time? Wayne:  We fell in love with the area a long time ago. That’s where [my wife Jo and I] spent our honeymoon, near Gatlinburg, which is a big honeymoon spot for hillbillies like myself!  And we’ve always liked the area. We love the climate and the people, and the scenery is just stunning. NEW YORK MAN BIKING ACROSS AMERICA REVEALS ‘RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS’ IN ARKANSAS Fox News Digital:  You've now had the chance, you've said, to go back into the studio and record original music.  Wayne:  My last two projects were basically cover albums, ""Songs the Jukebox Taught Me,"" volumes 1 and 2 [released in 2016 and 2018, respectively]. This period of time has given me the opportunity to sit down and think about an all-original album, and really take the time to do it right.  It's hard, when a person is wearing a lot of hats, to really have the time to focus on just that. So I'm grateful. JOHN RICH ON THE GIFT FROM HIS DAD THAT MEANT THE MOST Fox News Digital:  What's on your bucket list for the year ahead? Wayne:  It may be a new normal, and that’s fine — at this point I’ll take any kind of normal it can be. But I'm looking forward to getting out and playing for people in concert again.      
      Dallas Wayne's new album is ""Coldwater, Tennessee,"" out in April. Wayne has played across North America and Europe and released 12 albums. He's also performed on various compilation and band recordings. In 2020 he won the Academy of Western Artists' Pure Country Group of the Year (Heybale!).  
       (Audium Nashville) In terms of a bucket list, I’ve been fortunate. So I think I’m going to have to get me a new bucket, for my bucket list.  There’s a lot of stuff that’s already been fulfilled. I've loved working with  Willie [Nelson] , Ray Price, Merle Haggard.

   Fox News medical contributor  Dr. Nicole Saphier  discussed a recent article published by  The Atlantic  that admitted  universal mask requirements  are ‘illogical’ but continued to defend the mandates. On ‘ Fox & Friends ’ Monday, Dr. Saphier explained that public health officials need to focus on regaining public trust and providing treatments for vulnerable populations rather than enforcing mandates that ‘make no sense.’ HOUSE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR PELOSI TO LIFT ‘DRACONIAN’ MASK MANDATES AT CAPITOL DR. NICOLE SAPHIER:  Any sort of public health intervention has to make sense, so to say that it doesn't need to make sense is absolutely wrong. And instead of trying to manipulate human behavior with certain actions that have nominal or negligible benefit in the pandemic, we need to be focusing on increasing ventilation and making sure people who are vulnerable to this virus and other viruses have what they need in terms of vaccines, boosters, treatments and so forth.  But when it comes to the generalized population, these public health interventions that make no sense, it is time for them to be removed so we can gain back that public health trust that we have lost immensely throughout this pandemic.

   Lawyers for  Baltimore ’s top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, filed a motion seeking to have the federal indictment alleging she improperly received  COVID relief  funds and lied on mortgage applications to purchase two vacation homes in  Florida  thrown out, arguing prosecutors were racially and politically motivated to ruin the career of a ""young, progressive, Black, female elected official.""  The motion filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland seeks to have the federal indictment against Mosby dismissed on the basis of ""selective or vindictive prosecution."" It specifically names Assistant U.S. Attorney Leo Wise, alleging the ""animosity"" shown toward Mosby is ""an example of a pattern and practice of engaging in similar conduct aimed at other Black officials,"" and U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Erek Barron, who signed the indictment against Mosby.  ""Since its inception, the prosecution against State’s Attorney Mosby has been driven by malicious personal, political, and even racial animus on the part of the prosecutors,"" lawyers for Mosby wrote.  MARILYN MOSBY, BALTIMORE'S TOP PROSECUTOR, PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO PERJURY CHARGES

       (Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun via AP, File) They continued, ""The indictment returned against State’s Attorney Mosby is the culmination of a long-running crusade to ruin the political career of a young, progressive, Black, female elected official, led by a prosecutor who has repeatedly made financial contributions to the campaigns of her political opponents and led a prosecution team that engaged in intentionally reckless behavior that stonewalled any participation by State’s Attorney Mosby and failed to disclose exculpatory evidence to the Grand Jury.""  The motion alleges the indictment was purposely timed to influence her June 2022 reelection prospects.  A two-term Democratic Baltimore State’s Attorney, Mosby, 42, is charged with two counts of perjury and two counts of making false statements on loan applications. She allegedly requested coronavirus-related withdrawals in the amounts of $40,000 and $50,000 from the City of Baltimore’s deferred compensation plans. The indictment said she falsely verified meeting at least one of the qualifications as defined under the CARES Act despite earning a gross salary of $247,956 in 2020.  Mosby is also accused of making false statements on loan applications for a $490,500 mortgage to purchase a home in Kissimmee, Florida, and for a $428,400 mortgage to purchase a condominium in Long Boat Key, Florida. She allegedly failed to disclose that she and her husband, Nick Mosby, Democratic president of the Baltimore City Council, also allegedly had unpaid federal taxes in the amount of $45,022 or that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had placed a lien against all property and rights to property for that amount. Nick Mosby is not charged in the case.

It also accused Wise of engaging in a ""smear campaign"" against Mosby, accusing her office of leaking information about a federal investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s Gun Trace Task Force.  ""When you don’t have the law or the facts on your side you claim that it’s a witch hunt, you point fingers back at the prosecutors, that’s not uncommon,"" Vignarajah, a former federal prosecutor, told  Fox 45. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Experts told the Sun it’s a long shot that the motion to dismiss the indictment will be granted based on the subjective views of the prosecution alone, pointing out that sometimes lawyers file litigation for the purpose of public relations or word of the motion reaching prospective jurors.  The Sun noted that Mosby’s defense team has long targeted Wise and contacted the Justice Department to attempt to squash his year-long criminal tax investigation into Mosby and her husband before charges were filed. But Friday’s motion was the first time they have publicly gone after Barron.  "

How China may have already won its cold war with the US with American dollars,Fox News Staff," February 21, 2022 2:27pm EST","  close     Video   How China may have already won its Cold War with the US with American dollars   Former Green Beret Rep. Michael Waltz breaks down the Chinese Communist Party's long-term strategy of economic warfare with the United States on 'The Will Cain Podcast.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla. a former Green Beret, sat down for ""The Will Cain Podcast"" and outlined what he believes is  China 's long-term strategy for economic warfare in its cold war with the United States. WILL CAIN:  You laid out [Chinese President and Central Military Commission] Chairman Xi's goals to replace the United States as the world's dominant power, to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Is this, in your mind, a rivalry, a cold war, a relationship that is building toward kinetic war? Is it building toward bombs, or is the strategy in the plan more subversive, more internal, more soft power, more corruption? What is the strategy from China? REP. MICHAEL WALTZ, R-FLA.:  They are. They are in a cold war with us. And again, you know, a cold war is when an entity is using diplomatic, informational, economic – taking over international organizations in a way to coerce their opponents. And that's exactly what the Chinese Communist Party is doing. The big piece of it is going to be Taiwan. TOM COTTON WARNS JOE BIDEN 'NOT UP TO' TAKING ON LOOMING COLD WAR WITH CHINA Why does Taiwan matter so much and why should it matter to the American people? Well, if you look at where it sits on the map, Will, once China controls Taiwan – aside from the fact that it's a flourishing free market and a democracy that we will have let be forcibly taken over by a communist dictatorship – aside from that, they will then be able to control the trade routes into Japan, into South Korea, Australia, Malaysia and to some extent, even India. And heading into the Middle East, China will then control about half of the world's GDP and global trade. And at that point, their economic warfare, it will have a huge boost in the arm in terms of their strategy.   Video I think economic warfare is the best way to describe it if you understand Chinese military theory. They want to be prepared for a kinetic war. But their real theory is checkmate, just like we did against the Soviet Union when they stepped aside and just couldn't afford to compete militarily anymore. That's what China plans to do to us. They're watching us bankrupt ourselves on our entitlements. They're bankrupting on  COVID . We're watching Biden send billions of dollars to buy COVID tests from China because we've lost the capability to make them. That's like buying your firefighting supplies from the arsonist that set the fire.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And meanwhile, they have also – this is the big piece – they've cornered the market on things to make our economy go: 90% of our pharmaceuticals, 90% of our computer chips, 90% of our rare earth minerals that we need for basic economic functions that Chinese have cornered. And so when we say ""Made in America,"" it's not just a human rights issue because they're making those products with modern-day slavery. It's not just an American jobs issue, it's a national security issue. We cannot be dependent on our greatest adversary for what makes our society function – and they've created that dependency deliberately. And American companies are absolutely complicit.  CLICK BELOW TO LISTEN TO THE FULL EPISODE OF ""WILL CAIN PODCAST"":   Episodes of "" The Will Cain Podcast "" are available now and can be downloaded at  foxnewspodcasts .    "

   As most of the world knows by now,  Queen Elizabeth II  — who is 95 — tested positive for  COVID  and has been experiencing ""mild, cold-like symptoms,"" as Buckingham Palace announced Sunday morning. The monarch's diagnosis of COVID-19 followed the same diagnosis for her eldest son,  Prince Charles , 73, who tested positive for the virus for the second time, earlier this month.  The Queen — beloved by millions around the world — is fully vaccinated as well as boosted.

A selection of  parents and other family members  across the U.S. shared thoughts about all of this with Fox News Digital — here's what they said. ‘Wake up, America!’ ""I find it ironic that a 95-year-old woman with COVID can function and perform ‘light duties’ — and health care workers who have COVID can go to work because somehow they aren’t contagious enough to be home for an extended period of time,"" said Jennifer Ohman, a mother of two in Padre Island,  Texas .  ""Yet my kids are forced to stay out of school for 10 days — that's 10 [full] days if they contract COVID.""  NC VETERAN IN NEED OF KIDNEY TRANSPLANT VOWS HE'LL DIE FOR HIS FREEDOM Ohman continued, ""We know full well they aren’t contagious for that long. And relying on Zoom classes — which aren’t what parents think they are — to somehow make up for forcing the obnoxiously long absence is ridiculous. It puts these kids behind in classes. They are considered to have an unexcused absence if they aren’t placed into Zoom classes in a timely fashion.""

Gavin Newsom  has claimed that there is a state of emergency in California because of COVID. According to the applicable law, an emergency is defined as the ""existence of conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state caused by conditions such as air pollution, fire, flood, storm, epidemic . . . causing a ‘state of war emergency,’ which, by reason of their magnitude, are or are likely to be beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of any single county, city and county…""   CALIFORNIA FIRST STATE TO MAKE OFFICIAL SHIFT TO ENDEMIC APPROACH TO 'LIVE WITH' CORONAVIRUS No one who watched the Super Bowl this month could logically conclude that a state of emergency still exists throughout California.

   You have to feel a little bad for the many heads of western democracies. For them, the end of the  coronavirus  pandemic is really the worst thing they can imagine.   Put yourself in their position. For two years you've wielded unprecedented power over your country. You've told citizens where and when they can work and shop and worship and go outside. You've controlled what they wear. You've decided how their children will be educated and what drugs they must put into their bodies. For a person with no useful skills and limited job prospects in the real economy, and that describes all of them, it's been an extraordinary experience: No democratic leader in history has ever been this powerful, as powerful as you are right now. You're like a god. Each morning, you wake up and survey your creation, and you revel in your omnipotence. You can hardly believe how far you've come. The last thing you want is for all of it to end.  But of course, it is ending. The virus that gave you these powers is in retreat. It's no longer a public health emergency. The vaccine that you promised would be a panacea, didn't work in the ways you pledged they would. They didn't stop infection or transmission. Now you've done your best to hide that fact, but everybody knows it. So for you, the jig is up. The ball is over. It's almost midnight. Just a few hours from now, you will once again be merely a scullery maid. You'll be taking orders from your citizens rather than giving them and the thought of that sends you into a panic.   VIRGINIA PARENTS FRUSTRATED SOME SCHOOLS ARE STILL FORCING MASKS ON KIDS         
      Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, speaks during a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on Wednesday, Jan. 12, 2022.
       (David Kawai/Bloomberg) What do you do next? How do you make this moment last forever? There's only one way. You must find a new emergency that justifies making your powers permanent. If you're going to remain god, you're going to need the devil to fight. So, if you're wondering why so many western leaders suddenly are vilifying their own populations, people they were supposed to represent, this is why. Find an enemy, create a crisis, stay in power forever. It's the oldest recipe for tyranny that there is. If we don't recognize it in our own age, it's only because nothing like this was supposed to happen in a democracy, but it is happening, most clearly in  Canada .   Last week, Justin Trudeau used a peaceful trucker strike to declare martial law. Trudeau seized control of the police. He shut down opposition media coverage. He declared himself the final arbiter of all financial transactions in the nation of Canada. These are dictatorial powers, but they were necessary, Trudeau explained, because this was an emergency. White supremacist and other sedition-minded forces, backed by foreign saboteurs (sound familiar?) threatened the very existence of  Canada . The truckers were effectively an invading army.   CANADIAN TRUCKER BEATEN BY POLICE SAYS HE WON'T BE INTIMIDATED: ‘THEY BROKE MY BODY, BUT NOT MY SPIRIT’ Well, over the weekend,  Trudeau  defeated that army. They were unarmed. He is not. Trudeau cleared the trucker strike by force. Yet his emergency powers remain. Today, Justin Trudeau explained that he will remain in full control of Canada indefinitely. And that's essential, he said, to keep Canada safe, but the video tells a very different story. In fact, it's Trudeau's crackdown on human rights that has put Canadians in danger. Trudeau's forces told one woman she's no longer allowed to record what happens in her own city.   WOMAN: I just want to get a coffee, ok?  POLICE: Why is the camera in my face right now? ...Right now you are in the red zone.  WOMAN: I’m scared, I want to go for a coffee down there.  POLICE: Where are you from?   WOMAN: Alberta.   POLICE: We’ve been patrolling all day, if we see you again it will be different.   OTHER POLICE OFFICER (GRABBING A HOLD OF THE CAMERA): Leave. Take your camera and get out of here.   WOMAN: I’m walking away.   OTHER POLICE OFFICER: Do you understand that?   WOMAN: I’m walking away...  OTHER POLICE OFFICER: Walk away. Your phone doesn’t need to be in our faces when you’re walking away.   WOMAN: I’m walking away.  RAND PAUL DENOUNCES TRUDEAU’S ‘DANGEROUS’ EMERGENCIES ACT, WARNS OF SIMILAR US LAWS     ""I just want a cup of coffee.""  ""Get out of here.""  Multiply what you just saw by an entire country, and that's Canada tonight. There's no longer any pretext that this is about the COVID pandemic. No one in Trudeau's government is trying to protect Canadians from anything much less a virus. This is political repression.   If you doubt that, consider what happened to a place called the Ionic Cafe. That's a coffee shop in downtown Ottawa. On Sunday, riot police tried to break into the cafe and shut it down. Why? Because the proprietors had dared to serve coffee to the truckers during the protest. Under Justin Trudeau, that is now a crime. A man called Enrico, who works at the cafe, said he saw Trudeau's forces mistreat a civilian on the sidewalk, possibly like the mistreatment you just saw. When he told them to back off, ""Hey, this is Canada,"" they turned on him.   MAN FILMING: OK, share this out, you guys, get it out everywhere now. Get it out. They're saying they're going to break the window. They already walked around back, you guys. Here's your tax service. Here's your taxes at play, everyone. Welcome to absolute tyranny.   So that kind of thing is happening all over the capital city of Canada. The virus is in retreat, but there's a new crisis and that crisis is disobedience. Last week we showed you the footage of Trudeau's forces trampling a woman with horses. Now, internal texts show the officers who rode those horses celebrated what they did.   ""Just watch that horse video. That is awesome,"" said one officer.  Awesome. An elderly woman being trampled by a horse. The Canadian government has confirmed that those texts are real but none of the supposedly progressive politicians in Canada care in the least. No one on the Canadian left or the American left, for that matter, has condemned any of this or any other grotesque violation of human rights in Canada. State media aren't even reporting that it's happening. But it is happening. Over the weekend, the show obtained footage of a particularly brutal beating in Ottawa during the crackdown. When you watch it, you can see a man being kneed repeatedly by Trudeau's men. DAVID PAISLEY: I can hear noises of people getting shoved around outside, being arrested, a man being kneed there. That's terrible.     Video Kneeing him, again and again, and again. He wasn't resisting. And the man who shot that footage was called David Paisley. He runs a website called shedmedia.ca. Police have arrested Paisley and seized the camera equipment he used to shoot that— $5,000 worth. Now we thought that video was remarkable, so we alerted several Canadian media outlets over the weekend, including CBC and CTV to this footage. We gave them David Paisley's contact information, news organization to news organization. But none of them reported on it. So we looked into it ourselves.   Several protesters who were there said that a trucker in an orange jacket called Csaba Vizi was attacked by police officers during the crackdown. We reached Csaba Vizi and he confirmed it and provided footage. It shows him exiting his cab calmly, kneeling down in front of his truck and clasping his hands behind his head.  OTTAWA POLICE CALLED ‘TYRANTS,’ ‘CRIMINALS’ AFTER THREATENING FREEDOM CONVOY TRUCKERS   CSABA VIZI, TRUCKER: I’m proud you’re here   UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (speaks French)   CSABA VIZI, TRUCKER: I don’t speak French.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It’s very hard, but, you don’t lose.   CSABA VIZI, TRUCKER: No, I am not.   UNIDENT I FIED MAN:  Second battle.   CSABA VIZI, TRUCKER: As soon as they let me out, I’ll be back. … I’m going down. I’m going down by knee, hands behind my back. I am self-ready... I’m peacefully protesting.   So the man surrenders, on camera, and then he's kneed repeatedly into submission. Now we'd love to have more footage, but it turns out none of Justin Trudeau's men was wearing a body camera at the time. That's pretty weird. No one in Canadian state media cares to follow up on that story, and so they're not. They don't care, either.  The brutality is just one element of this crackdown. On Saturday, Ottawa's new police chief promised to hunt down the regime's enemies no matter where they are in coming months and ruin them financially.  OTTAWA POLICE CHIEF: So, I will stand here today again and say this demonstration is over. Go home. If you don't go home, we will remove you from the streets. … If you are involved in this protest, we will actively look to identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges. Absolutely.   If you were involved in a protest, you'll be sanctioned and charged. What does that mean exactly? Well, last night, Justin Trudeau's government announced that it's also going after anyone who ""directly or indirectly participated in the protests."" According to Mark Strahl, who is a member of Canada's parliament, the dragnet has ensnared one of his constituents. It's a woman called Briane. Her crime? Donating $50 to the truckers. In response ""her bank account has now been frozen."" Briane is a single mom from Chilliwack, working a minimum wage job. She now has no money at all. So under Trudeau's new order, she won't simply lose access to her bank account. She will also lose access to credit unions, co-ops, trusts and loan providers.     Video This is what the collapse of democracy looks like. It's not simply beating people in the streets. It's making it impossible for them to live because you steal all their money. You award yourself the power to control every dollar in your country. Where's that power come from? Well, it's a self-appointed power, that Justin Trudeau now has, and you prevent anyone from speaking out against you. So Trudeau is not just targeting people who parked their trucks in Ottawa, he's crushing anyone who supports them. He's going after their employers. Over the weekend, the owner of a trucking company in Ontario received this threatening call from Trudeau's authorities.  CALLER: Well, my job is to, um, to phone the registered owner of the trucks to ask them if they're still in Ottawa and if they are still in Ottawa, I wish to tell the registered owner that now they can be subject to the new measures under the Emergency Measures Act, so they can like seize assets and freeze bank accounts and all that kind of stuff.   So, Trudeau's government is promising to seize company assets and zero up bank accounts because one company truck parked on the street in Ottawa. It's not simply an overreaction, a grotesque overreaction to a peaceful protest. It's a wild and unprecedented expansion of powers that is permanent, and that make democracy impossible. Canada's finance minister explained that Trudeau is not going to give up this power. Ever.   WAPO EDITORIAL BOARD SUPPORTS FEDERAL NO-FLY LIST FOR PASSENGERS WHO DON’T OBEY MASK MANDATES ON FLIGHT     CANADIAN FINANCE MINISTER:  We will be putting forward measures to put those tools permanently in place. The authorities of FINTRAC, I believe, do need to be expanded to cover crowdsourcing platforms and payment platform and their payment providers. So that's... something that we need to do and we will do and that needs to be in place permanently.   You'll notice that some of the harshest authoritarians, not simply in Canada, but across the West, speak in light, lilting voices going up on the last syllable. They don't sound like Mussolini, but they've awarded themselves greater powers. By the way, this all seems to have happened overnight in Canada, but that's simply because most Americans don't pay attention.   A year ago, Canada's government began debating something called C-36. That bill would allow activists to head to court and accuse someone of ""contemplating hate speech""—not even saying something unauthorized, just thinking about saying it. So, what is hate speech exactly and what does it look like to contemplate it? Well, back around 2020, a man living in British Columbia wrote to complain to a Canadian government official called Bob Rae. The man wrote that ""you and your government have blood on your hands for not quarantining Canada's borders before we’d imported COVID from around the world.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

In a statement to Fox News, Cantrell spokesman Beau Tidwell admitted that there was not a ""perfect adoption of the guidelines in every instance"" over the weekend. ""The mask guidelines and the vaccination requirement will remain in effect thru Mardi Gras,"" he said. ""That has not changed and it will not change. Under the current guidelines, masks may be removed indoors while eating and drinking.

   The Washington Post editorial board expressed support on Monday for a federal no-fly-list that would include passengers who flout mask mandates during their flight. The editorial board published an op-ed titled ""Grandstanding Republican senators try to protect unruly passengers,"" which focussed on the Republican opposition to a national no-fly-list that seeks to bar disruptive passengers from future flights.

FLIGHT ATTENDANTS' UNION PUSHES FOR NO-FLY-LIST FOR UNRULY PASSENGERS While GOP senators vehemently oppose the idea of a national registry that equates mask flouters to terrorists, the editorial board thinks it's a ""no-brainer"" to address the mounting confrontations triggered by the pandemic.

   Hong Kong  will test its entire population of 7.5 million people for  COVID-19  in March, the city’s leader said Tuesday, as it grapples with its worst outbreak driven by the omicron variant. The population will be tested three times in March, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said. She said testing capacity will be boosted to 1 million a day or more. QUEEN WITH COVID CONTINUES 'LIGHT DUTIES,' YET AMERICAN KIDS MUST ISOLATE, QUARANTINE: US PARENTS WEIGH IN ""Since we have a population of some 7 million people, testing will take about seven days,""  she said . Hong Kong has reported about 5,000 new daily  infections  since Feb. 15, with the cases threatening to overwhelm its  healthcare system . Since the current surge began at the beginning of the year, the city has recorded nearly 54,000 cases and 145 deaths. The order for citywide testing comes after  mainland Chinese authorities  dispatched  epidemiologists , health workers and other medical resources last week to help contain the outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.

       (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Hong Kong has largely aligned itself with mainland China’s ""zero-COVID-19"" policy, which aims to totally stamp out outbreaks, even as many other countries are shifting their approach to living with the  virus . Lockdowns of entire cities have been imposed in a number of areas of the mainland, but Lam said no such measure is currently being considered in Hong Kong because it is ""not realistic."" She also denied that the central Chinese government is giving instructions to Hong Kong on how to handle the epidemic. ""I reiterate that the central government never issued any instructions on our anti-epidemic work,"" she said. ""The central government will offer support as needed or upon our request, but of course we will always exchange our views."" HONG KONG BANS FLIGHTS, IMPOSES OTHER COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS The ""zero-COVID-19"" strategy means that Hong Kong authorities often take measures such as locking down residential estates for mass testing when positive cases are detected, imposing strict quarantine requirements on  travelers  and ordering the shuttering of  businesses . The rapid surge of infections in the city has threatened to overwhelm its healthcare system. Health officials said last week that hospitals were already at 90% of capacity and isolation facilities were full. People who test positive for the virus in Hong Kong must either be admitted to a hospital or a quarantine facility.

       (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) Lam acknowledged on Tuesday that the city’s isolation facilities are ""severely inadequate"" and that it is ""working very hard with the full support of the central  authorities "" to build more. Current social-distancing measures, such as a ban on dining at restaurants after 6 p.m. and the closure of businesses such as gyms and bars, will be extended until April 20. ""This is not good news to the sectors affected, but really at this stage of the pandemic we have no choice but to take these measures,"" Lam said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She said the city hopes to boost its  vaccination  rate to 90% by early March. Other measures announced Tuesday include ending the  school year  early and moving the normal July-August summer holidays forward to March and April so that schools can be turned into facilities for testing, isolation and vaccination. Flight bans from countries classified as high risk, including Australia, Canada, India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Britain and the U.S., will be extended to April 20.  "

   Family  members of patients  hospitalized  in the intensive care unit (ICU) for  COVID-19  were more likely to have symptoms of  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  than those of patients with  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)  from another illness, according to researchers. In a study published in JAMA Network, a team of  French  authors conducted a prospective cohort study in 23 ICUs in France from January to June 2020 – and a final follow-up in October 2020.  BIDEN ADMIN AWARDS $103M FROM AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO FIGHT HEALTH CARE WORKER BURNOUT ARDS survivors and family members – one family member per patient – were enrolled, with  517 family members in total .  Family member symptoms of PTSD at 90 days after ICU discharge were measured by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised score and symptoms of anxiety and  depression  at 90 days were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.  The researchers used multivariable logistic regression models to determine the association between the COVID-19 status and outcomes.

Video ""There are many potential explanations for these findings, including the need to comply with strict isolation measures to prevent viral transmission and the strain put on ICU staff due to the surge in patient numbers caused by the pandemic. When ICUs are perceived as closed departments, visitors may feel unwelcome, and these closed ICUs can generate stress and symptoms of anxiety, depression or PTSD in the family members."" they explained, noting their findings are consistent with previous research.  Lastly, they pointed out that perceived social support during the ICU stay was an important factor associated with family outcomes, citing a survey of nearly 900 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in China that found poorer perceived social support was associated with anxiety, depression and PTSD.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Social support is the subjective perception of the extent to which family, friends and other network members are available and helpful.

Time to end secret data laboratories—starting with the CDC,Dr. Marty Makary," February 22, 2022 7:00am EST","  close     Video   CDC reportedly published 'tiny fraction' of COVID data   Former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield says The New York Times report highlights a need for modernizing the public health data system. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The American people are waking up to the fact that too many public health leaders have not always been straight with them. Despite housing treasure troves of critical  COVID  data on vaccines and on natural immunity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has only been releasing slivers of data that support its own scientific dogma. Most of the media has fallen for it. Throughout the pandemic, the New York Times and other outlets has only sourced doctors agreeing with the establishment groupthink, dangled fear to young people, and amplified every headline government doctors feed them as they did with weapons of mass destruction. DEBATE ERUPTS OVER OFF-LABEL COVID-19 VACCINE USE FOR CHILDREN UNDER FIVE     
      The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been criticized and mocked from all sides after a series of muddled messages have baffled Americans amid a record surge in COVID-19 cases and the spread of the omicron variant. (iStock)
       (iStock) But this week, one Times reporter picked up on what many of us have been saying about the CDC’s deception. The reporter learned that the CDC data on booster efficacy released two weeks ago conveniently left out hospitalization data for people under age 50. So, let’s trace the origin of the widespread employer and college booster mandates for young people. There never was, and still is, zero scientific, clinical data that boosting reduces COVID hospitalizations in young healthy people. The FDA had bypassed its expert advisory group to authorize boosters in young people after its own experts previously voted 16-2 against the idea and two top FDA officials quit over White House pressure over this very issue.   Video Throughout the saga, the media gave public health leaders a megaphone to broadcast their agenda, unchecked, failing to ask them any basic questions. Like, where’s the supporting data? Colleges and universities, which pride themselves as bastions of intelligent inquisition, embarrassed themselves by blindly following the scientific dogma, requiring all vaccinated students to get boosted, even when many already had natural immunity. So, do public health officials understand why people don’t trust them? Hiding data on boosters in young people is only one piece of the political shell game the CDC plays. There more than 150 studies supporting natural immunity, including a JAMA study recently published by my Hopkins team. Moreover, the observational clinical data are clear—natural immunity reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation and death in healthy people to nearly zero.   Video But despite this overwhelming body of scientific evidence that has withstood the test of time, the CDC has consistently cited two studies to the contrary, both highly flawed studies it published itself. One of those studies is a CDC study using a 2-month sliver of Kentucky data. Despite having data on all 50 states, the CDC only reported data from that one state last year. The obvious explanation is that it was the only state and time period that gave the CDC the results it wanted. Why else would it not report the same data from any of the other 49 states? Moreover, in its jury-rigged study, the rate of infection in each group was less than 0.01 percent. Regardless, the CDC study vigorously concluded that vaccinated immunity was 2.3-times better than natural immunity, based on a very small difference in the sample which was likely attributable to other factors. Dr. and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky used it to propagate the notion that those who had COVID still must get vaccinated.   Video Last month, New York and California released data to the CDC that natural immunity was 2.8 times more effective in preventing hospitalizations than vaccinated immunity—a benefit that was the same for those with hybrid (natural and vaccinated) immunity. But absent from its reversal was any apology to the many American workers with natural immunity it insisted be fired from their job for not being vaccinated unvaccinated. Ironically, when employers fired those with natural immunity for not being vaccinated, they fired those least likely to spread the infection or get hospitalized. Similarly, the CDC put out two highly flawed studies that promoted mask mandates, detailed by Dr. Vinay Prasad.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The American people are just hungry for honesty.  They want the data straight, not politically curated by a small group of like-minded scientists. If I were advising President Joe Biden, I would tell him that the CDC needs to restore the public trust by making all CDC data available in real-time for researchers around the country to access and to study. It’s time we end secret data laboratories in the government. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The CDC has a pattern of hoarding data in order to cherry-pick the findings it likes and then publish them in its own journal, called MMWR. This is not how a respectable country should function during a pandemic. An optimal response to a national health emergency should warrant more data transparency, not less.

   Canadian conservative  members of Parliament are outraged that their government extended the unprecedented Emergencies Act, with one MP describing it as further splitting the country into ""two Canadas."" ""I believe history will judge this government and this Prime Minister very harshly. I think that he, instead of engaging in dialogue and showing leadership, he brought the hammer down on peaceful protesters who came here sincere of heart to protest his government's actions, not the government,"" Conservative Member of Parliament Kerry-Lynne Findlay, who serves British Columbia, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Tuesday.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  invoked the Emergencies Act last week, giving power to the government to prohibit public assembly, restrict travel and require businesses - such as tow companies - to act on the government’s demands. On Monday night, the Canadian House of Commons voted 185 to 151 in favor of extending the emergency powers, which sparked quick backlash from Conservative leaders who point out that protesters have already been cleared from Ottawa and various border crossings to the U.S.  ""Today, after the Prime Minister reported that Ottawa’s streets are cleared, that the trucks are gone and the borders are opened, the Liberals and the NDP voted to extend the Emergencies Act. This allows the government to use vast new powers and keep the state of emergency going,"" Conservative leader Candice Bergen said in a statement.

Let's talk about this. Let's discuss it.’ He called them misogynists and racist and said that they held unacceptable views. And they basically questioned: How long should we tolerate these people?"" Findlay said.  Trudeau, however, has previously supported other protests, including Black Lives Matter in 2020  and knelt in support of the movement .

Findlay said this is the first time she has felt ""uncomfortable"" in her own country, explaining that she has to show her ID in order to leave her apartment to get to her office amid police in riot gear patrolling Ottawa.   ""This government has so much to answer for.

   Pregnancy-related deaths  for  U.S.   mothers  climbed higher in the  pandemic’s  first year, continuing a decades-long trend that disproportionately affects Black people, according to a government report released Wednesday. Overall in 2020, there were almost 24 deaths per 100,000 births, or 861 deaths total — numbers that reflect mothers dying during pregnancy, childbirth or the year after. The rate was 20 per 100,000 in 2019. BABY BORN 2/22/22 AT 2:22 AM IN ROOM 2: 'BLESSING FOR HER FAMILY' Among Black people, there were  55 maternal deaths per 100,000 births  — almost triple the rate for whites. The report from the National Center for Health Statistics does not include reasons for the trend and researchers said they have not fully examined how COVID-19, which increases risks for  severe illness  in pregnancy, might have contributed.

       (iStock) The coronavirus could have had an indirect effect. Many people put off medical care early in the pandemic for fear of catching the  virus , and virus surges strained the health care system, which could have an impact on pregnancy-related deaths, said Eugene Declercq, a professor and maternal death researcher at Boston University School of Public Health. He called the high rates ""terrible news"" and noted that the U.S. has continually fared worse in maternal mortality than many other developed countries.

The 2020 rate among whites, 19 per 100,000 births, was essentially unchanged. Reasons for those disparities are not included in the data.

While Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, issued an executive order last August mandating masks in Kentucky schools, this month he advised schools to continue the masking policies. Today, many school districts in the Bluegrass State are relaxing the mask requirements. Bankston, 31, has strong feelings about what happened to her family.  ""I haven’t ever felt like masks work — people are still getting sick,"" Bankston told Fox News Digital in a phone interview, expressing her opinion.

   The United Kingdom's government is increasingly reassured that the  coronavirus  pandemic was the result of a lab leak in Wuhan,  China , according to a new report.  While the theory that the coronavirus was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology was dismissed by world governments early into the pandemic, evidence continues to trickle out supporting the claim. Government officials in the U.K., U.S., and elsewhere have begun voicing support for further investigation into the lab leak possibility.  Now, sources tell British newspaper the Telegraph that the ""official view"" within the U.K.'s leadership is that the virus did indeed escape from the Chinese lab, though government officials are more open about that view in private than in public.  ""I think the official view [within Government] is that it is as likely as anything else to have caused the pandemic. A lot of people like myself think it is more likely. I think attitudes have changed a little bit. The zoonotic transfer theory just didn’t make sense,"" Cambridge bio-security fellow Hamish de-Bretton Gordon  told the paper .  FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN ""There is a huge amount of concern about coming out publicly, but behind closed doors most people think it’s a lab leak. And they are coming round to the fact that even if they don’t agree with that, they must accept it’s likely, and they must make sure the policies are in place to stop it,"" de-Bretton explained.

The board voted 12-2 to rescind the order on March 1, citing positive COVID-19 trends.  LA COUNTY TO LOOSEN MASK RULES WHEN COVID-19 NUMBERS IMPROVE: REPORT The Maryland General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review  has scheduled a virtual hearing  and vote on the request for Friday. ""This action aligns with the data and the science, the recommendation of the State Superintendent of Schools, and the guidance of medical professionals across the country,"" Gov.

In  California  – the first state to  formally shift to an ""endemic"" approach  to the coronavirus – officials previously delayed a decision on school mask regulations.  In an online announcement, California Health and Human Services Secretary  Dr. Mark Ghaly said  his department would reassess whether the current rule should change on Feb. 28.  ""This is not a decision we take lightly, it is not a decision that is a hasty one,"" he said, noting that California’s vaccination rates for children are still low and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends masks in schools. CHICAGO TO FOLLOW ILLINOIS IN LIFTING MASK ORDER BY MONTH'S END California's indoor mask mandate has been lifted for most indoor settings for those who are vaccinated.  Those who remain unvaccinated will still be required to be masked indoors and everyone – regardless of vaccination status – will have to wear masks in higher-risk settings. Local governments can continue their own indoor mask requirements, as Los Angeles County health officials announced they would. Supervisor Janice Hahn  tweeted Tuesday  that the Department of Public would issue a new health order allowing for vaccinated people to remove masks indoors at places that check for proof of vaccination.  The order would potentially ""take effect Friday,"" and she said it puts the county ""significantly closer to aligning with the state.""   Video Previously, county officials said face coverings would no longer be required in certain outdoor settings once hospitalizations in the area drop and that masks would still be necessary indoors until the county recorded two consecutive weeks at or below ""moderate"" transmission of the  virus . The county said it would not further rescind masking requirements unless there were no reports of significantly circulating variants of concern that have the ability to threaten vaccine effectiveness. While the omicron variant is still circulating around the country – making up 99.9% of new COVID-19 cases – the number of daily cases and deaths has fallen.  Data  from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center shows 99,820 new cases in the past day, with 2,300 new deaths.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In January, the number of new cases topped one million and deaths exceeded 4,400, as the variant of concern surged.  The  World Health Organization (WHO)   said Tuesday  that the number of new cases around the world fell 21% in the last week, marking the third consecutive week that COVID-19 cases have dropped.

DEBATE ERUPTS OVER OFF-LABEL COVID-19 VACCINE USE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE "" Herd immunity  is an elusive concept and doesn’t apply to coronavirus,""  says Dr. Don Milton  at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.

       (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a community to be immune. Early hopes of herd immunity against the coronavirus faded for several reasons. One is that antibodies developed from available vaccines or previous infection dwindle with time. While vaccines offer strong protection against severe  illness , waning antibodies mean it’s still possible to get infected — even for those who are boosted. RELATIVES OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COVID-19 MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE PTSD: STUDY Then there’s the huge variation in vaccinations. In some low-income countries, less than 5% of the population is vaccinated. Rich countries are struggling with vaccine hesitancy. And young children still aren’t eligible in many places. As long as the  virus  spreads, it mutates — helping the virus survive and giving rise to new variants. Those mutants — such as omicron — can become better at evading the protection people have from vaccines or an earlier infection.   Video Populations are moving toward ""herd resistance,"" where infections will continue, but people have enough protection that future spikes won’t be as disruptive to society, Milton says.

   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday said younger males should consider waiting longer between doses of the  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines  in order to reduce the risk of a rare form of  heart inflammation . In an update on its website, the agency suggested an eight-week interval between the first and second doses of a primary mRNA vaccine schedule.  WHAT IS MYOCARDITIS? SIGNS, SYMPTOMS TO LOOK FOR The ""mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at the FDA-approved or FDA-authorized intervals, but a longer interval may be considered for some populations. While absolute risk remains small, the relative risk for myocarditis is higher for males ages 12-39 years, and this risk might be reduced by extending the interval between the first and second dose,""  the agency said .  The CDC cited studies in adolescents and adults showing the small risk of myocarditis associated with vaccines might be reduced and peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness may be increased with an interval longer than four weeks.      
      Myocarditis is a rare form of heart inflammation.
       (iStock) ""Extending the interval beyond 8 weeks has not been shown to provide additional benefit. There are currently no data available for children ages 11 years and younger. Therefore, an 8-week interval may be optimal for some people ages 12 years and older, especially for males ages 12–39 years,"" the CDC said. Notably,  the change will not impact many people , as the CDC reports 73% of people age 12 and older already have gotten two doses of vaccine. In addition, while the suggestion to wait up to two months doesn't apply, the initial, shorter interval is still recommended for those with weakened immune systems, people age 65 and older and anyone who needs fast protection due to risk of  severe disease . The government authorized the Pfizer shots as a two-dose series spaced three weeks apart, and the Moderna shots to be spaced four weeks apart. CORONAVIRUS VACCINES: WHY ARE SOME COUNTRIES RECOMMENDING SINGLE DOSE FOR TEENS, YOUNG ADULTS? Mostly adolescent and young adult males developed myocarditis after the second shot and the CDC says that – among males ages 18 to 39 – the condition has been reported in about 68 per 1 million getting the second Moderna dose and about 47 per 1 million getting the second Pfizer dose. The CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized Pfizer vaccines in children ages 5-11 and adolescents ages 12-17 based on the determination that benefits of  COVID-19  vaccination outweigh the risk of serious side effects.  ""After reviewing available data on the risks and benefits, ACIP and CDC determined that the benefits (e.g., prevention of COVID-19 cases and its  severe outcomes )  outweigh  the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for children, adolescents and young adults.,"" it said. The CDC also highlighted that most myocarditis and pericarditis patients have been hospitalized for short periods and that most have achieved resolution of acute symptoms.    Video Symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis include chest pain,  shortness of breath  or tachycardia, and people should seek care if such symptoms develop, particularly in the week after vaccination. The CDC said accumulating evidence suggests a higher risk for myocarditis following Moderna vaccination compared with Pfizer vaccination, with data showing the risk for myocarditis or pericarditis lower in young adults after mRNA booster doses.

   The NPR Politics Podcast worked to paint an angrier depiction of parents who have concerns about their children's  education . On Tuesday, the panel consisting of host Asma Khalid alongside congressional correspondent Susan Davis and Connecticut Public Radio’s Catherine Shen discussed what they saw as the ""angry parent"" demographic rising in the country. Specifically, they referred to parents who oppose mask mandates in schools and have shown a willingness to vote Republican  despite being life-long Democrats  to change them.

      High school students and teenagers go back to school in the classroom at their high school. They are required to wear face masks and practice social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""And I think one of their frustrations - and they're fairly offended by other parents who really want to unmask their kids right now, you know, right this instant. And because, to them, it's a very selfish act because you're only thinking about your child, which is natural. It's a very natural instinct to do that. But then the other side of the parents are thinking, well, but you're not thinking about my kids,"" Shen said. Davis, who claimed parents upset about mask mandates are a ""minority,"" suggested a racial component to Republican interest in  supporting parental rights. ""The polling isn't amazing on this issue, but what we do know is that white parents are exponentially more likely to be supportive of making masks optional or rolling back the mandates than non-white parents are. Part of that's health care access, different socioeconomic concerns. But I also think, politically, that also speaks to why a lot of Republicans are looking at that type of demographic as someone that they could win back over,"" Davis said.

   A more  infectious  type of the  omicron variant  has surged to account for more than a third of global COVID-19 cases sequenced recently, adding to the debate about whether countries are ready for full reopening. Health  authorities are examining whether the subvariant of omicron, known as BA.2, could extend the length of COVID-19 waves that have peaked recently in Europe, Japan and some other places. ""We’re looking not only at how quickly those peaks go up, but how they come down,""  World Health Organization  epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove  said . ""And as the decline in cases occurs…we also need to look at: Is there a slowing of that decline? Or will we start to see an increase again?"" CDC DIRECTOR: STUDIES YET TO SHOW BA.2 SUB-VARIANT EVADING CURRENT VACCINES MORE THAN OMICRON BA.2 accounted for only 3.9% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. in the week through Feb. 12, according to the most recent estimate released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After an omicron surge in December 2021, the U.S. has experienced an equally  sharp and steady fall . Other countries have had more trouble shrugging off omicron. In Denmark, where an estimated 92% of cases were BA.2 as of mid-February, a peak at the end of January was followed by another two weeks later. Evidence so far suggests  BA.2 is some 30% more infectious  than its cousin, the BA.1 subvariant that kicked off the omicron wave in southern Africa in November 2021. In South Africa, BA.2 has accounted for 82% of cases so far in February, according to health authorities in that country.     
      WHO Technical lead head COVID-19 Maria Van Kerkhove attends a news conference at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland July 3, 2020. 
       (Fabrice Coffrini/Pool via REUTERS) Overall, BA.2 accounted for 35% of COVID-19 virus samples whose genomes were recently submitted to the global Gisaid database, according to a Gisaid update released Tuesday. Studies so far suggest that both types of omicron pose about the same risk of severe disease in humans. That risk is lower than last year’s delta variant, but with so many people getting infected, the death toll from omicron is still high. A South African analysis  comparing a group with likely BA.1 omicron against another group with likely BA.2 found both groups had roughly equal odds of being hospitalized and developing severe disease. Early studies suggest that vaccines and booster shots work equally well in both omicron types in preventing serious illness.  A study by the U.K. Health Security Agency  found both types could easily get around the immunity of people who had received their full primary course of  vaccination  at least six months earlier. But a booster shot restored protection against symptomatic disease from both variants, to 69% for BA.1 and 74% for BA.2. WHO TRACKING 4 OMICRON SUB-VARIANTS, SAYS PREVENTING ALL COVID TRANSMISSIONS 'NOT THE GOAL' Still, some initial research in test tubes and animals leaves room for concern that BA.2 might be more harmful. A team led by Kei Sato at the University of Tokyo found that BA.2 had an easier time  invading the cells in the lungs of hamsters  compared with BA.1. Prof. Sato said BA.2 has as many differences from BA.1 as last year’s delta variant had from the original virus detected in Wuhan, China. He said BA.2 might merit its own Greek-letter name rather than being classed as a type of omicron. New York University virologist Nathaniel Landau has led  research  suggesting that omicron BA.2 is even better than BA.1 at evading  monoclonal antibody drugs  developed to fight COVID-19. Nonetheless, he said a new Greek letter wouldn’t be needed unless BA.2 turned out to be more harmful to humans. ""If it were to turn out that it has higher pathogenicity, that would then be a reason. But at this point, no,"" he said.   Video Prof. Sato said the current co-circulation of BA.1 and BA.2 could spawn a hybrid  virus  that would ""more easily increase and be more harmful."" Scientists said the public-health measures to deal with omicron were generally the same regardless of its type—vaccination, booster shots, social distancing, masks, good ventilation and so on. The question is whether the spread of the even more infectious omicron type should affect the loosening of restrictions. Denmark lifted all restrictions on Feb. 1, only to see a rise in deaths in people infected with COVID-19. Officials said the virus wasn’t the cause of some of the deaths. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP WHO officials said the threat of BA.2 was a reason for caution.

""Infections might increase again, depending on how BA.2 spreads from now on,"" Dr. Nakagawa said. Some governments say that with the public weary after two years of COVID-19, it is time to open up. They observe that the population in many countries has built up considerable immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through multiple vaccination rounds, previous infection or both. The U.K. is  ending all restrictions  starting Thursday, including a legal requirement to self-isolate for those who test positive.

Studies have shown that BA.2 has a growth advantage over BA.1. Studies are ongoing to understand the reasons for this growth advantage, but initial data suggest that BA.2 appears inherently more transmissible than BA.1, which currently remains the most common omicron sublineage reported,"" it said. ""This difference in transmissibility appears to be much smaller than, for example, the difference between BA.1 and delta. Further, although BA.2 sequences are increasing in proportion relative to other omicron sublineages (BA.1 and BA.1.1), there is still a reported decline in overall cases globally."" Studies are being conducted to evaluate the risk of  reinfection  with BA.2 compared with BA.1. Reinfection with BA.2 following infection with BA.1 has been documented, though initial data suggests infection with BA.1 provides strong protection against reinfection with BA.2 for a limited period. The WHO says it will continue to closely monitor BA.2., including whether it causes more severe disease.  BA.2, which has a lot of mutations  can appear like a delta infection  because it lacks a genetic quirk of the original omicron variant. FAST-SPREADING COVID-19 OMICRON TYPE REVIVES QUESTIONS ABOUT OPENING UP Vaccines appear just as effective against the sub-variant according to early research.  One estimate suggests BA.2 s about 30% more contagious than the original omicron.

   Queen Elizabeth II  postponed two virtual audiences as she continued to experience cold-like symptoms from COVID-19, Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday. It was the second time this week that the British monarch had canceled virtual sessions. However, the 95-year-old spoke to  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  by phone on Wednesday, sparking an encouraging sign of her recovery. The monarch’s age,  COVID-19  diagnosis, and a health scare last year have caused worry among officials and the public. Her positive test for the coronavirus over the weekend prompted concern and get-well wishes from across Britain’s political spectrum. On Sunday, the palace said that Elizabeth, who has been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot, would continue with ""light"" duties at Windsor Castle.

       (Photo by Alastair Grant - Pool/Getty Images) The queen, who is the country’s longest-reigning monarch, has a series of engagements coming up as she celebrates her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne. She is scheduled to host a March 2 reception which would involve meeting hundreds of diplomats at Windsor. She is also due to attend the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14, and then a March 26 memorial service, also at the Abbey, for her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last April at age 99. Public celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee are scheduled over a long weekend between June 2-5, with festivities including a military parade, a day of horse racing and neighborhood parties. Both the queen’s eldest son Prince Charles, 73, and her 74-year-old daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall contracted COVID-19 earlier this month. Charles has since returned to work. There are also thought to be several recent virus cases among staff at Windsor Castle, where the queen is staying. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER

In the past year, she has been seen using a walking stick, and in October she spent a night in a London hospital for unspecified tests. The queen’s doctors ordered her to rest after that, and she was forced to cancel appearances at several key events, including Remembrance Sunday services and the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November. This month she returned to public duties and has held audiences both virtually and in-person with diplomats, politicians and senior military officers. During one exchange caught on camera last week, she walked slowly with a stick and said ""as you can see I can’t move"" in an apparent reference to her leg. The queen delivered two televised messages to the nation early in the pandemic in 2020 and has sought to lead by example. She let it be known she had been vaccinated, and last year sat alone during the funeral of her husband of 72 years, because of coronavirus restrictions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP     
      Queen Elizabeth II's COVID diagnosis came during a difficult time for the family.
       (Ben Stansall/Pool via AP) Elizabeth's diagnosis came during a difficult time for the royal family. The queen's second son,  Prince Andrew , recently settled a U.S. lawsuit brought by a woman who claimed he had sexually abused her when she was 17 and traveling with the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 61-year-old strenuously denied the claim by Virginia Giuffre. He agreed in a settlement to make a substantial donation to his accuser’s charity. Soon after, London’s Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into allegations that people associated with one of Charles’ charities offered to help a Saudi billionaire secure honors and citizenship in return for donations.

   While more  mask mandates  have been lifted across the country this week, some have also acted to reverse proof of  COVID-19   vaccination  requirements.  In New Hampshire,  schools  will no longer be allowed to mandate masks.  ""I don’t think this should be viewed as a drastic change or measure, it’s just kind of another step forward as we continue to return to the old normal,""  Gov. Chris Sununu said .

Customers who are unvaccinated must continue to wear masks indoors unless they are actively eating or drinking and all customers must still prove either that they are vaccinated or have a recent negative COVID-19 test.  Last week, California became the first state to formally shift to an ""endemic"" approach to the coronavirus.

""With the mask mandate, a continued effort to get more people vaccinated and the virus weakening, we’re in a much better place today — a place where we are cautiously optimistic, a place where we can move from a mask requirement to a mask recommendation,"" County Executive Sam Page said at a news conference. The city of St. Louis will still require masks in public places and Kansas City’s mask mandate expired last Thursday.  In Georgia,  senators are advancing bills  that would let public school parents opt their children out of school mask mandates and would prohibit many state and local agencies from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination.

   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to announce changes to the metrics that the agency uses in recommending  facial mask  coverings. The change will move from focusing on COVID-19 case counts to taking a more holistic view about a community's risk from the coronavirus. Current guidelines advise face coverings for individuals in communities that have substantial or high transmission. Around 95% of U.S. counties meet the criteria for substantial or high transmission, according to the Associated Press. The agency will announce the changes on Friday. Most Americans will not live in areas where the CDC is recommending masking under the new guidelines, which factor hospitalizations and local hospital capacity in addition to the number of cases.

   More than half of U.S.  abortions  are now done with  pills  rather than  surgery , an upward trend that spiked during the  pandemic  with the increase in  telemedicine , a report released Thursday shows. In 2020, pills accounted for 54% of all U.S. abortions, up from roughly 44% in 2019. COLOMBIA LEGALIZES ABORTION UP TO 24 WEEKS The preliminary numbers come from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. The group, by contacting providers, collects more comprehensive abortion data than the U.S. government. Use of abortion pills has been rising since 2000 when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone — the main drug used in medication abortions. The new increase ""is not surprising, especially during COVID,""  said Dr. Marji Gold , a family medicine physician and abortion provider in New York City. She said patients seeking abortions at her  clinic  have long chosen the pills over the medical procedure.     
      FILE = Containers of the medication used to end an early pregnancy sit on a table inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, Oct. 29, 2021, in Fairview Heights, Ill. A report released Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022 says most U.S. abortions are now done with pills rather than surgery. The trend spiked during the pandemic as telemedicine increased and pills by mail were allowed.
       (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) The pandemic prompted a rise in telemedicine and FDA action that allowed abortion pills to be mailed so patients could skip in-person visits to get them. Those changes could have contributed to the increase in use, said Guttmacher researcher Rachel Jones. The FDA made the change permanent last December, meaning millions of women can get a prescription via an online consultation and receive the pills through the mail. That move led to stepped-up efforts by abortion opponents to seek additional restrictions on medication abortions through state legislatures. APPEALS COURT RULES IN BIDEN'S FAVOR ON ABORTION REFERRALS The procedure includes mifepristone, which blocks a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue, followed one or two days later by misoprostol, a drug that causes cramping that empties the womb. The combination is approved for use within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, although some health care providers offer it in the second trimester, a practice called off-label use. So far this year, 16 state legislatures have proposed bans or restrictions on medication abortion, according to the Guttmacher report. It notes that in 32 states, medication abortions must be prescribed by physicians even though other health care providers including physician assistants can prescribe other medicines. And mailing abortion pills to patients is banned in three states — Arizona, Arkansas and Texas, the report says.   Video According to the  World Health Organization , about 73 million abortions are performed each year. About 630,000 abortions were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019 although information from some states is missing. Guttmacher’s last comprehensive abortion report dates to 2017; the data provided Thursday comes from an update due out later this year.

Rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome appears in some teenagers after COVID-19 vaccination: study,Shiv Sudhakar," February 24, 2022 7:43pm EST","  close     Video   Loss of taste and smell from COVID could be linked to genetics, study shows   Dr. Marc Siegel investigates the mystery of parosmia and who may be at risk.

   Young people  between the ages of 12-20 have reported several cases of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome, otherwise known as MIS-C, where the immune system goes on overdrive after being vaccinated for COVID-19, according to a recent Lancet  report .  The report noted  MIS-C  is a rare condition that can happen two to six weeks after COVID-19 infection with patients complaining of fever and showing signs and symptoms of multi-organ involvement with systemic inflammation.  ""Patients with MIS-C usually present with persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions and, in severe cases, with hypotension and shock,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on their  website .

       The agency added the illness ""may begin weeks after a child is infected with SARS-CoV-2. The child may have been infected from an asymptomatic contact and, in some cases, the child and their caregivers may not even know they had been  infected .""  First recognized in April 2020, 5973 cases were reported to the CDC between May 2020 to November 2021, with the study’s authors hypothesizing the illness develops because of a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19  infection  in susceptible patients who have a genetic predisposition for the syndrome.  EXPLAINING WAR TO KIDS AS RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: WHAT TO SAY AND HOW TO SAY IT But the study investigated if the syndrome also occurred after COVID-19 vaccination.      
      A team of researchers from Mount Sinai claimed to have discovered an ""important clue"" behind a rare, potentially serious coronavirus-related inflammatory illness in children, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C. 
       (iStock) The study analyzed the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for potential cases of MIS-C after COVID-19  vaccination  from Dec. 14, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2021, in individuals aged 12─20 years, identifying 21 young people, with a mean age of 16 years old, who met the CDC’s definition of the inflammatory condition.  The researchers noted all of these patients were hospitalized, 57% were admitted directly to the intensive care unit, with 71% with laboratory evidence of past or recent COVID-19 infection, but all were discharged home.  Even though six young people in the study didn’t have evidence of a prior  COVID-19  infection, the researchers hypothesized because the lab assays have limited sensitivity for asymptomatic infections, the young participants might have been infected with COVID-19 even though they tested negative, so ""vaccination might be coincidental to the subsequent MIS-C  illness .""  Over 21 million individuals ages 12-20 years old received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine as of August 31, 2021, so the overall reporting rate for MIS-C after vaccination is 1 case per million people compared to a rate of 0.3 cases per million vaccinated individuals among those without prior laboratory evidence of COVID-19, per the study.   These rates are ""substantially lower than the previously published incidence of MIS-C among unvaccinated individuals in this age group in the USA who had SARS-CoV-2 infection (approximately 200 cases per million SARS-CoV-2 infections),"" the researchers  said .  CDC: PEDIATRIC ER VISITS SKYROCKET FOR INJURIES AND EATING DISORDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC Although the report seems concerning, most of the cases in the study were not considered fully vaccinated, so unvaccinated young people are still more likely to develop MIS-C than those who are fully vaccinated, according to a Today  report .   ""At first glance, it seems to cause us to step back and say, ‘Wait a minute, are these vaccines contributing to MIS-C?’"" said Dr. Jim Versalovic, pathologist-in-chief and COVID-19 command center co-leader at Texas Children’s  Hospital .   ""It does the opposite for me. It emphasizes the point of vaccination.""  The study found 11 young people developed MIS-C after their first vaccination dose with eight days as median time from first being vaccinated to hospitalization compared to 10 individuals who developed the systemic illness after receiving their second dose and five days as the median time from first being vaccinated to getting hospitalized.       
      An expert says amputations relating to MIS-C are an ""incredibly rare and unfortunate consequence.""
       (Photo courtesy of Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital) The study has limitations including underestimating rates of all MIS-C cases among those who received the COVID-19 vaccine because the data was analyzed by passive reporting systems and because the researchers relied only on reports with final diagnoses that noted MIS-C since there is no definitive test to diagnose the condition.   Experts urge parents to get their teenagers vaccinated as only 57% of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated, according to the  CDC .  The researchers concluded the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine to MIS-C is unknown, so they encouraged health care providers to rule out other causes when evaluating individuals with a clinical presentation consistent with the systemic syndrome.  ""Continued surveillance for MIS-C illness after COVID-19 vaccination is warranted, especially as pediatric COVID-19 vaccination is authorized and recommended for younger children who comprise the highest proportion of MIS-C cases after SARS-Cov-2 infection,"" the researchers said.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Click  here  for more information for parents about the syndrome.   "

   For two years,  Hong Kong  successfully insulated most of its residents from  COVID-19  and often went months without a single locally spread case. Then the  omicron  variant showed up. The fast-spreading mutation breached Hong Kong’s defenses and has been spreading rapidly through one of the world’s most densely populated places, overflowing hospitals and isolation wards and prompting measures to test the entire population of 7.4 million and hastily build six isolation and treatment centers. The  surge  shows what happens when COVID-19 strikes a population unprotected by immunity from previous  infections  and has exposed a low  vaccination  rate among elderly citizens who are bearing the brunt of the crisis. Only about 30% of Hong Kong residents over the age of 80 and around 58% of those in their 70s are fully vaccinated, lagging younger populations by a large margin. This is despite the fact that vaccines have been widely available in Hong Kong since early 2021. HONG KONG ORDERS MANDATORY COVID-19 TESTS FOR ALL RESIDENTS The city has reported about 150 deaths in the past three days, many among the unvaccinated elderly. Health authorities said vaccine reluctance among the elderly is an unfortunate side effect of Hong Kong’s success in warding off the  virus  for months. Many thought the risk of getting COVID-19 was virtually zero since there were no cases, and senior citizens were led to believe that the risk of vaccination was greater than not getting vaccinated, said Karen Grépin, a public health expert at the University of Hong Kong. Hundreds of millions of jabs have been given to people around the world, and few serious risks have been identified after intense safety monitoring. But early reports of a few adverse reactions to the vaccine in Hong Kong created a false perception that people needed to be perfectly healthy to get vaccinated.

       (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) ""Hong Kong is the world’s guinea pig when it comes to omicron,"" said Grépin. The Hong Kong experience may also hold lessons for mainland  China  and its decision on when to reopen its borders and eliminate a two- to three-week quarantine requirement for anybody entering the country. Only a small proportion of the population has been infected, thanks to the Communist Party’s strict zero-COVID approach of mass testing and lockdowns. The Hong Kong government’s response has been to ramp up a zero-COVID approach similar to the mainland. Chinese officials have urged Hong Kong to stick to the approach, despite  grumbling  from residents, with even leader  Xi Jinping  weighing in to make sure the message got through. Under the zero COVID-19 policy, everyone who tests positive in Hong Kong must be isolated. While this worked in the past, Hong Kong, unlike the mainland, does not have the beds to isolate so many people in a large outbreak. Construction teams from the mainland are rushing to build two permanent and four temporary isolation and treatment centers to handle more than 20,000 patients. It's an effort reminiscent of the early days of the virus when China hastily constructed two temporary hospitals in the city of Wuhan in a matter of days. CDC LOOSENS COVID-19 INDOOR MASK GUIDANCE, INCLUDING FOR SCHOOLS Authorities also  launched  a vaccine pass on Thursday, requiring vaccination to enter shopping malls and other premises, and it is driving some to get the shot. ""If I don’t get vaccinated, I can’t even go to  restaurants ,"" said 73-year-old Yu Mui as she lined up for her first dose Friday. ""So I have to come here today even though I am worried about the side effects."" Scientists  believe the omicron variant is milder than the delta version of the virus. But Hong Kong’s situation is unique. In other nations where the omicron variant spread, people had immunity from vaccines or previous infections, and this blunted the severity of the disease. With many people unvaccinated and vulnerable, Michal Head, a global health expert at University of Southampton, fears that it may have a ""worryingly high burden of severe COVID-19 in coming weeks"". ""Omicron has been described by some as ‘mild’. But it’s certainly still severe enough to have a high mortality rate, far higher than flu or other similar respiratory infections,"" he warned.     
      Despite the rain, residents line up to get tested for the coronavirus at a temporary testing center in Hong Kong Feb. 21, 2022.
       (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Irene Leung, who is 70, said she didn’t feel the need to be vaccinated earlier because the pandemic was under control in Hong Kong. On Friday, she lined up for her first dose. ""But now it gets worse, and so I decided to come and get vaccinated,"" she said. ""It protects not only myself but also my family members."" And Hong Kong has announced it will test everyone in the city next month, taking another page from the mainland playbook. China has sent in experts and others to put up temporary labs to handle the volume of tests. But Benjamin Cowling, who studies epidemics at Hong Kong University, advised against mass testing in March since it would be hard to deal with the sheer number of confirmed cases that the approach would throw up. Instead, he suggested using the nimbler, rapid tests to alert people to isolate at home if they were infected and had mild symptoms. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ultra-contagious nature of the omicron variant means that unless you have incredibly stringent lockdown measures, mask wearing and social distancing norms, you’re not going to stem the spread, said Dr. Jimmy Whitworth, an infectious diseases expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Even China is battling multiple outbreaks, though they are much smaller than Hong Kong’s. China on Saturday reported 249 new cases in the mainland, of which 156 were among people who had arrived from overseas. Hong Kong, by comparison, reported more than 17,000 new cases in the latest 24-hour period and 66 deaths. Whitworth said that Hong Kong’s priority right now should be to encourage vaccination. ""That is by far and away, the most important message. And particularly targeting the elderly,"" he said.   "

   Why aren’t more of us challenging the  Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC)  masking recommendations for children? Despite changes in indoor masking requirements that have liberated most adults, the CDC continues to cling to unscientific COVID-19 guidelines that harm our children by keeping them masked for no good reason. In many school districts, parents have been stripped of the authority to opt-out on behalf of their children because their school officials adhere to the CDC guidelines religiously. It is time for us to take a closer look at the CDC and its decision to keep our children in masks.  Despite minuscule evidence of benefits and increasing evidence of harms—physical, mental and emotional—the CDC refuses to veer from its recommendation that children ages 2 and up should be masked indoors regardless of vaccination status. That’s also how we get the ridiculous airline guidance: ""All passengers 2 years and older must wear a face mask for the duration of the flight, including during boarding and deplaning with no medical exceptions allowed."" Don’t blame the airlines (at least for the rules). Blame the CDC. OMICRON VARIANT: IS IT LEADING US CLOSER TO HERD IMMUNITY AGAINST COVID-19? In addition to the heartbreaking anecdotal evidence revealing that our kids are not OK, we have government reports and medical surveys documenting our children’s flagging mental and emotional conditions. And now there’s emerging evidence that masking practices stunted our children’s development. For example, with masked adults and peers, how can children learn to discern the nonverbal modes of communication that come from reading the faces of those they encounter? The children harmed the most are from families with limited resources. All this is occurring despite the fact that children are at low risk of being affected by or dying from  COVID-19 ; some evidence even suggests that children present a lower risk for spreading the disease, too.

While the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and other European nations followed the WHO, our Washington bureaucrats rejected the consensus that children under 5 are ""at low risk of illness,"" that masks were not ""in the overall interests of the child,"" and that ""many children are unable to wear masks properly.""

   Even as the  omicron  wave recedes and Americans look to return to normal, we can see ripple effects from the pandemic that will be with us for years. In some cases, the long-term impacts of the pandemic mean we won’t ""return to normal"" at all. In the realm of our children’s education, we have the opportunity to make some shifts that will improve  education  outcomes both for students and our country. For example, when learning shifted from schools to homes, parents had a view into their children’s education with unprecedented clarity. Parents now know not only what their kids are learning, but also what they’re  not  learning. When it comes to preparing students to be successful in college, in their careers, or in their roles as informed citizens, we’re failing terribly– the U.S. remains in 13th place globally when it comes to quality education. VIRGINIA PARENTS FRUSTRATED SOME SCHOOLS ARE STILL FORCING MASKS ON KIDS For years, business leaders and parents have questioned whether students were graduating from high school with the skills needed to succeed in college and beyond. The questions surrounding this skill gap have not been around hard skills or content knowledge, but rather durable soft skills. Many employers are struggling to find stand-out entry-level candidates due to their lack of soft skills, and this is still a major hurdle for recruiters today, especially as they screen candidates coming out of the pandemic. Here’s the rub: The skills most sought after by scholarship selection committees, university admissions offices and employers are rarely directly taught in schools. In a  recent study , seven out of 10 most requested job skills in job postings were durable soft skills - and leadership and communication were the highest in-demand competencies. The study argues that ""the long-term success of our economy, our country’s competitive advantage, and our  national security  requires improving educational outcomes.""     
      High school students required to wear masks.
       (iStock) This suggests it is essential for students not only to master school subject matter, but to actively cultivate the skills that will serve them in college and the workplace. We know that to be successful at anything requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and yet we are sending our future off into the real world drastically unprepared. New graduates literally cannot afford to adopt a ""learn as you go"" mentality when it comes to developing these essential attributes. Durable soft skills are a key predictor of successfully getting your foot in the door and long-term career success. So why wait to start developing them? DR. KENT INGLE: DON'T LET THE COLLEGE PRICE TAG INTIMIDATE YOU - HERE ARE 5 WAYS TO FINANCE YOUR EDUCATION The pandemic has exacerbated these lingering concerns surrounding the soft skills gap. This is because our kids missed out on a crucial component of their education that is integral to cultivating soft skills and leadership – extracurricular activities and learning opportunities. In fact, it is beyond the classroom where so many of these essential skills are often learned. Extracurricular activities like sports, camps, clubs, speech and debate, and more offer kids the opportunity to emerge as leaders and build their skills as communicators. Kids who participated in extracurriculars had better grades, better attendance, and overall better well-being. Without these programs in their full capacity, this generation of students missed out on leadership experiences needed to succeed in higher education and ultimately the workforce.   Video The lack of in-person leadership opportunities has also skewed this generation of high school students’ perception of important soft skills. Only 3% of high school students today value leadership as a necessary skill, when in fact it is one of the most high-demand skills that employers and colleges seek out. This mindset will not serve them well when they walk across the graduation stage and embark on their next stage. Only 3% of high school students today value leadership as a necessary skill, when in fact it is one of the most high-demand skills that employers and colleges seek out.   The key is to impart these competencies well before the university, not after the fact in the midst of their job search. Would you ask a baseball player to learn to pitch as he is heading to a major league tryout? No, it takes years of practice to master a craft. The same is true of the skills that will drive success in school and throughout life. These skills need to be ingrained and exercised from a young age in order to set our children up for success. Unfortunately, the absence of formative after-school programs has stunted their growth in these areas.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER   That’s where we see an opportunity. For years the Reagan Foundation has offered award-winning programs focused on developing the next generation of engaging and informed young leaders. Now, we intend to take what we’ve learned about leadership and communication development, and offer it to any student in the country. We believe that we can help our country and our future by providing e-learning solutions to fill in these soft skill gaps that school closures have widened. We can lean on the accessibility of remote learning to help students bridge these gaps at their own pace and of their own volition. As an educator, and as a father, I want my kids to be able to substantively and confidently answer the prompt, ""Tell us about a time when you were a successful leader,"" when it comes time to work on their college applications.

The world is a small place on the internet and social media and too many of us plug ourselves into events in the news and feel like it is happening to us. I agree with Dr. Brewer. The hard-wiring of the human brain, which runs through the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex and, once triggered, leads to an outpouring of stress hormones, is far more powerful than anything we can do to try to reason around it. Instead, the cure for our cycles of worry lies in more positive replacement feelings and desensitizing ourselves to our worries by ""getting back on the bike’’ once we have fallen off. When it comes to fear, it is helpful to have leaders we can admire and emulate who aren’t projecting that worry themselves.    This treatment is just as useful for fear of war as it is for fear of COVID. Too many people are afraid to go to restaurants or the movies even after the mask requirements have been removed, and the numbers of cases have dropped dramatically.  While I applaud the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for shifting its focus to community prevalence and hospital capacity rather than case positivity rates, I think it took them far too long to get there. Overloaded hospitals interfere with health care delivery of all kinds, beyond just COVID.  The new message of liberation from excess masking and mandates is welcome but overdue. Vaccines and boosters should always have been recommended as a way to be liberated from severe COVID risk rather than as something forced. As a society, we have worn the yoke of COVID fear for too long, and it has scarred us. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When it comes to fear, it is helpful to have leaders we can admire and emulate who aren’t projecting that worry themselves.  Right now there is no one better to look to than Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who, while dressed in a flak jacket, responded to the U.S. offer to airlift him out of the combat zone in Kyiv with the already famous words, ""I need ammunition, not a ride."" This ironic response from the former comedian sends a message of hope and courage to overcome the fear. Accused of being a Nazi by Putin, Zelenskyy, a Jew who lost three great uncles in the Holocaust, was cool and projected courage and calm. ""How can I be a Nazi?"" he said.   Video And now that Putin has raised his nuclear status to ""special combat readiness,"" the fear level is even higher, and those of us who grew up during the heart of the Cold War, with practice drills spent hiding under our desks at school, feel extra shocks of fear and worry.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But keep in mind that courage, love and laughter course through the same centers of the brain as worry and anxiety. It is impossible to feel both at the same time.   The world is coming together around the Ukrainian leader. He reminds us of this message we need to live by: If Putin’s fear and intimidation tactics aren’t working against Zelenskyy, whose country is being invaded and whose life is menaced, then these awful emotions don’t have to work against anyone.

CDC 'COVID-19 by County' tool helps you look up guidelines by local areas,Cortney Moore," February 28, 2022 1:44pm EST","  close     Video   CDC issues relaxed mask guidance   Fox News correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports the latest on the CDC's masking recommendations on 'Special Report.'

   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that face masks might be optional for Americans who are in areas where  COVID-19  infections are a ""low"" or ""medium"" risk. Knowing which areas have a ""community level risk"" can be a challenge for commuters and domestic  travelers , but the CDC has launched an online COVID-19 by County tool that aims to help people keep track of coronavirus infection data and determine local health and  safety  guidelines, and prevention methods. ""Levels can be low, medium, or high and are determined by looking at hospital beds being used, hospital admissions, and the total number of new COVID-19 cases in an area,"" the CDC wrote about its tool. ""Take precautions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 based on the COVID-19 Community Level in your area."" CDC LOOSENS COVID-19 INDOOR MASK GUIDANCE, INCLUDING FOR SCHOOLS The tool has a COVID-19 County Check section where users can enter a state and county to find current community level risks. When an area is entered into the county checker, the web page returns a community level risk level that either says ""low,"" ""medium"" or ""high,"" and makes recommendations like staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, getting tested if a person shows symptoms of the respiratory virus and taking precautions if a person is immunocompromised. HAWAII LAST STATE TO HOLD OUT ON LIFTING MASK MANDATE AS COVID CASES CONTINUE TO FALL The CDC’s masking recommendations vary for each community level risk. ""People may choose to mask at any time,"" the CDC’s COVID-19 County Check says about counties that are found to have a low risk. ""People with symptoms, a positive test, or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should wear a mask."" For counties that are found to have a medium risk, the CDC’s COVID-19 County Check says, ""If you are at high risk for severe illness, talk to your healthcare provider about whether you need to wear a mask and take other precautions."" Counties that are found to have a high risk, the CDC’s COVID-19 County Check says, ""Wear a mask indoors in public."" CDC GUIDANCE FOR CRUISE SHIPS NOW OPTIONAL Travelers can also take a look at COVID-19 community level risks across the country with the CDC’s national map, which shows each county’s risk level expressed in green (low), yellow (medium), orange (high) and white (N/A) markers. The map is also accompanied by a state and county data table that breaks down each area’s community level risks. The CDC’s COVID-19 by County tool was last updated on Friday, Feb. 25. It’s launch follows shortly after the health agency announced that Americans can ease up on wearing masks in public indoor spaces in areas where hospitals aren’t under strain, if they wish. While the CDC says  people  can choose to wear or not wear a mask in low or medium risk areas, masks are still mandatory on public transportation and government property for the time being, which includes airports, planes, trains and buses. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The federal mask mandate for interstate transportation will be in effect until March 18. It’s not immediately clear if the mandate will be extended. In the meantime, travelers can look toward the CDC’s COVID-19 by County tool for guidance when they’re not traveling on public transportation or to private properties that may have their own mask recommendations. ""These [COVID-19 Community Level] categories help individuals assess what impacts COVID-19 is having on their community so that they can decide if they need to take extra precautions, including masking based on their location, their health status, and their risk tolerance,"" said Dr. Greta Massetti from the CDC’s COVID 19 Incident Management Team on Friday, during a press briefing.

   The  White House  will no longer require people who are vaccinated against  COVID-19  to wear face masks on the premises, beginning Tuesday, March 1, a White House official told Fox News. The lifting of the requirement will come just hours before President Biden is set to deliver his first State of the Union address before Congress. CAPITOL DITCHES MASK REQUIREMENT AHEAD OF STATE OF THE UNION The White House's decision follows a similar one from Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician, who said that masks will be optional on the House floor for the president's speech, likely avoiding the optics of masked lawmakers gathered for the event, two years into the coronavirus pandemic.

The new system greatly changes the look of the CDC’s risk map and puts more than 70% of the U.S. population in counties where the coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals.

Education activists agree Democrats' change of heart on mask mandates is based on 'political science',Cortney O'Brien," February 28, 2022 6:44pm EST","  close     Video   Democratic governors lifting mask mandates accused of being influenced by 'political science'   Fight for Schools Executive Director Ian Prior calls Democrats' easing of mask mandates a 'cynical, political play.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Education experts analyzed the apparent changes of heart left-leaning media and  Democratic leaders  have undergone on  COVID-19   mask mandates  and concluded many are acting on ""political"" science, as opposed to actual science.  Democratic governors such as New Jersey's Phil Murphy, New York's Kathy Hochul, Connecticut's Ned Lamont, and Delaware's John Carney have all announced the rollback of mask mandates in their states as coronavirus cases decline. Fight for Schools Executive Director and America First Legal Senior Adviser Ian Prior argued it's a positive sign that mask mandates are being eased despite the reasoning, but stopped short of giving full credit to the Democrats enacting those changes. NY GOV. HOCHUL SAYS MASK MANDATE FOR SCHOOLS TO END MARCH 2 AMID DECLINING COVID CASES ""I think when you look at some of the changes that are coming out of states that have Democrat governors, what they are looking at is the polling data, the political science, not the science,"" Prior told Fox News Digital at the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference. ""But look, if they're going to get rid of mask mandates, and if they're going to be pressured by those things, well then that's great.""

       ""But let's not look at that and say, ‘Oh well they’ve been here all along,'"" he continued. ""No, this is a cynical, political play because they realize they've been losing this debate for years, and if they do not want to have, ultimately, what could be an epic Republican majority coming in 2022, then they have to moderate their message. And I'm not sure it's going to work because you have so many people on the far left that have captured the Democrat party that … having them now change their tune, I think people see through that."" National Director of Research at the American Federation for Children Corey DeAngelis used the same phrase to describe Democrats' loosening of mask restrictions. ""They're following the Political Science,"" DeAngelis told Fox News Digital. ""The underperformance of Democrats in November likely served as a wake-up call for politicians embracing restrictions. Polling likely nudged these politicians towards relaxing mandates. But whether the rollback is because of a genuine change of heart or due to political pressure, the result is the same: families have more freedom to choose. At the same time, choosing whether your child wears a mask at school is an extremely low bar when it comes to parental rights in education.""      
      Many American kids in a variety of states have had to endure mask mandates throughout the pandemic.

""Given the decline in our rates, our hospitalizations, strong vaccination rates and the CDC guidance, my friends, the day has come,"" Hochul said Sunday. ""Today we are going to be announcing that we will be lifting the statewide mask requirement in schools.""  Joy pointed out language that she argued showed the governor's order was influenced not by health, but by polling. Conservative commentator Bethany Mandel weighed in on why so many parents are decrying school masking. ""The outcry about it was really representative of the fact that so many people who are promoting masking of very young children have never actually met a young child,"" Mandel told Fox News Digital at CPAC. She argued that those proponents are discounting any disabilities a child might have, as well as any sensory sensitivities.

   During  President Joe Biden ’s first State of the Union address, he may choose to declare victory over  COVID-19 . For sure, case rates, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, and we should give the Biden Administration credit for utilizing President Donald Trump’s successful development of safe and effective vaccines to vaccinate close to 70 percent of all eligible Americans. AS COVID-19 CASES, HOSPITALIZATIONS FALL, STATES CONSIDER REVISING RESTRICTIONS

       The appropriate question to pose at this juncture, however, is at what cost has victory been won? When one examines Biden’s ""victory"" in detail, to include the tally of COVID cases and fatalities, its impact on the disruption of primary and secondary education for a generation of our youth, skyrocketing drug overdose deaths and related behavioral health issues, and inflation and deficits now at the highest levels in decades, it is, indeed, hard to ""distinguish it from defeat."" If the Biden team’s COVID response strategy had achieved any identifiable positive outcomes for all of this ruin, then admiration may be in order.  But it did not. Here are some of the details: COVID-19 cases and fatalities increased significantly. During the Biden Administration’s close to 400 days leading America’s COVID-19 response, the U.S. experienced over 135,000 COVID-19 cases, and over 1325 COVID-19 deaths, per day. These numbers represent twice the number of cases, and 20 percent more deaths, per day than we experienced during the year in which the Trump Administration was in charge of the nation’s COVID response. This outcome is all the more perplexing given the advantage of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and knowledge of the virus granted to the Biden team when it took office.   Video Learning loss has been significant. In July of 2021, my former colleagues at McKinsey & Company released a report after having analyzed data from Curriculum Associates, which had assessed COVID-related learning loss among 1.6 million students in more than 40 states. The results were grim: in one year’s time, students on average fell behind by five months in math and four months in reading. Moreover, this learning loss was more pronounced in minority students. In a more recent study released by NWEA in December of 2021 assessing over 6 million students, declines in achievement seemed to accelerate and ranged from 3-7 percentile points (~10 percent) in reading and 9-11 percentile points (~20 percent) in math. Again, these declines were more pronounced in minorities.   Video Drug overdoses skyrocketed, while overall mental health deteriorated. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks drug overdose deaths each year starting in July and ending the following June. In 2019, it reported just under 69,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States. In 2021, this figure had jumped to just over 101,000 deaths, or a 47 percent increase. While we may not be able attribute this entire increase to COVID, the 2-year period between 2019-2021 coinciding with the advent and spread of COVID represented the CDC’s largest ever recorded increase in overdose deaths, and the increase between 2020-2021 was significantly larger than the increase from 2019-2020. Beyond the increase in overdose deaths, the American Psychological Association noted in reviewing the National Center for Health Statistics data in November 2021 that the prevalence of anxiety and depression among American adults had both jumped by 200-300% over their 2019 levels.   Video COVID-induced inflation and deficits soared. In late March of 2021, during an interview on Bloomberg’s Wall Street Week, Larry Summers, President Obama’s Treasury Secretary, referred to President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) as ""the least responsible macroeconomic policy we’ve had in 40 years."" He predicted it would lead to higher inflation and indeed it did. When one looks at the debt-financed distribution of ARPA’s $1.9 trillion, no one should be surprised. Only nine percent of it went to fighting COVID, while the majority of it was used to either subsidize those out of the workforce or to help many financially irresponsible states narrow their budget gaps. By igniting a rate of 7.5 percent year-on-year inflation, 330 million Americans are now feeling the pain of Biden’s COVID-related policies.   Video The devastating impact of COVID, regardless of who was president, would have been tragic. But there is growing evidence that the Biden administration’s response strategy exacerbated the pandemic’s educational, emotional, and economic devastation without mitigating COVID cases and fatalities.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In the fall of 2020, the Trump Administration was adopting a strategy which focused on protecting those most vulnerable to COVID while letting our economy, schools, and the daily lives of Americans carry on normally. The Biden folks adopted an alternative strategy focused on bans, mandates, shutdowns, and the complete eradication of the virus at any cost. That cost has been astronomical, and the virus has been anything but eradicated.

   Democratic governors and gubernatorial candidates are ""expressing deep anxiety"" over voters' frustrations with their party, as well as President Biden, driving fears of potential losses in  elections this November .  According to a Monday piece by  The New York Times , Democrats attending a weekend fund-raising retreat in Florida hoped their worries about voter backlash amid Biden's plummeting approval rating would be put to rest with his Tuesday State of the Union address. THE BACKLASH OVER AN EXCESSIVELY WOKE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ""Democratic governors and their allies are expressing deep anxiety about the political conditions facing their party as President Biden’s approval rating slumps in a year when three dozen governorships are on the line, including in some of the nation’s most important battleground states,"" the piece read.  The Times noted that ""several governors, candidates for governor and donors"" acknowledged that voters were frustrated with the  continuing pandemic  and that it was ""damaging the party more than expected.""  Biden, whose  approval rating  reached a new low of 37% in recent polling,  had promised  on the 2020 campaign trail to ""shut down"" the virus. New variants, however, continued to spread, leading to record case numbers and deaths across the U.S. The piece added that those concerned Democrats hoped that Biden's State of the Union address ""might serve as a pivot point"" for the party's election chances, considering it was coming amid the  Russian invasion of Ukraine , Biden's nomination of Judge  Ketanji Jackson  as the likely first Black woman on the Supreme Court, and  the easing  of  coronavirus  guidance from the CDC.

Nearly half of Biden’s 500M free COVID-19 tests unclaimed,Associated Press," March 1, 2022 8:26am EST","  close     Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for March 1   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Nearly half of the 500 million free  COVID-19 tests  the  Biden administration  recently made available to the public still have not been claimed as  virus  cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test. Wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic, from  vaccines  to hand sanitizer, along with tests. On the first day of the  White House  test giveaway in January,  COVIDtests.gov  received over 45 million orders. Now officials say fewer than 100,000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household, delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. Still, the White House sees the program as a step toward a deeper, yet more elastic, testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane. ""We totally intend to sustain this market,"" Dr. Tom Inglesby, testing adviser to the COVID-19 response team,  told The Associated Press . ""We know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants."" The White House says Americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests, which leaves about 46% of the stock of tests still available to be ordered. WHITE HOUSE DROPPING MASK MANDATE BEFORE BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION: OFFICIAL Testing will become more important with  mask requirements now easing , say some independent experts. ""If  infection  control is still our priority, testing is central,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic. ""Four tests per household for one family will only last you one time. There should be enough tests for families to test twice a week."" Inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that. Private  insurers  are now required to cover eight free rapid tests per person, per month. Medicare coverage will start in the spring. The administration has also been making free at-home tests available through libraries, clinics and other community venues. Capacity for the more accurate PCR tests performed by labs has been built up. The White House recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year. Wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often. ""Right now it is still unclear,"" she said.

       (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File) President Joe Biden’s pivot to testing came under duress  as the omicron variant gained force just before Christmas. Tests were frustratingly hard to come by, and expensive. The White House is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late. ""There is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected,"" said Tim Manning, supply coordinator for the COVID-19 response team. Around mid-December, with omicron projections grimmer by the day, White House officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one. But if the government started siphoning up tests on the market, that would just make the shortage worse. ""A critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public,"" Manning said. The White House enlisted the Pentagon and parts of the Health and Human Services Department that had worked on the  Trump administration’s  vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines. Logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests. The Postal Service was designated to take the orders and deliver them. HONG KONG ORDERS MANDATORY COVID-19 TESTS FOR ALL RESIDENTS That part proved to be a good call, said Hana Schank, an expert on government technology projects with the New America think-tank. The Postal Service already had a database of every address in the land, and the means to deliver. ""At the federal level the only people who have a database connected to a fulfillment engine would be the Post Office,"" she said. The project took less than a month to get ready, Manning said. ""We said this is not online retail,"" he said. ""This is emergency response, so we have go to as fast as possible."" To make sure it wasn’t just the  tech  savvy who would end up getting free tests, the administration targeted a share of deliveries to people in low-income areas. The White House worked with service organizations to get the word out.   Video ""We prioritized the processing of orders to the highest social vulnerability zip codes in the country,"" testing adviser Inglesby said. One of the service groups was the National Association of Community Health Workers, whose members help people navigate the health care system. Executive director Denise Smith said the group was able to use its website to link more than 630,000 people to COVIDtests.gov. Overall about 20% to 25% of the tests have gone to people in distressed areas, officials said. Now that demand is way down, it’s unclear what will happen to the White House giveaway program. Allowing repeat orders is one possibility. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Smith says groups like hers should get any surplus. ""We know where the people are,"" she said. Although the program is still in its infancy, analyst Lindsey Dawson of the Kaiser Family Foundation believes its legacy may lie in familiarizing more people with testing. ""It may get someone comfortable with utilizing the tests, thinking about how they might use testing in their lives,"" she said. Savita Sharaf, a retiree from the Maryland suburbs outside the nation’s capital, said she ordered her free tests around the middle of January and got them in early February. She’s tried to conserve them, for added peace of mind. In the stores, she couldn’t find tests for less than $25. ""I’m so relieved because I can immediately test myself,"" Sharaf said. ""If we had a high vaccination rate, it would be a little easier to say let up on this program. But I feel we have to watch for the next month or two, to see what happens.""  "

   Co-host  Bill Hemmer  pressed White House press secretary  Jen Psaki  Thursday during  an extensive interview  on  ""America’s Newsroom,""  asking why the White House dropped its indoor mask mandate for vaccinated individuals ahead of  President Biden’s  State of the Union address. ""What changed in the science yesterday, Monday, as opposed to a week ago Monday?"" asked Hemmer.  ""It wasn’t actually yesterday, Bill. What the CDC did is they put out guidance last Friday that identified recommendations depending on what the hospitalization rates are in your part of the country,"" responded Psaki.   WHITE HOUSE DROPPING MASK MANDATE BEFORE BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION: OFFICIAL Psaki referenced  updated guidance  from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) which drastically eased its recommendations for mask-wearing across the country. According to the new guidance, Americans who are in an area of ""low"" or ""medium"" risk for COVID-19 transmission do not need to wear masks. This model means that over 70% of Americans can now go maskless. This includes  Washington D.C.,  where an indoor mask mandate from  Mayor Muriel Bowser  expired Tuesday. ""The recommendation is not to wear masks, so we’re not wearing masks in the White House, the president’s not going to wear a mask tonight. But it’s different depending on the part of the country,"" added Psaki.

The White House’s decision comes less than 24 hours before Biden’s State of the Union address. In a follow-up question, Psaki was asked how the president can convince Americans that he has helped to improve their lives over the past year. A February  Fox News poll  found only 18% said Biden’s actions on inflation are helping the country. 44% said his actions were hurting. Psaki noted that the State of the Union is a ""huge opportunity"" for Biden, who will spend much of his time discussing the conflict in  Ukraine  as well as his efforts to ""lead the world"" in standing up to autocratic leaders and the ""horrific"" actions of  Vladimir Putin.

   People who were  obese ,  smoked  daily or had a  psychological disorder diagnosis  during their adolescence years could age faster than their peers, according to  researchers .  In a study published at the end of last month in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, a group of international authors analyzed data from 910 participants of the  New Zealand  Dunedin study.  LUNG CANCER MORTALITY, INCIDENCE FELL AHEAD OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC: REPORT The  study  tracked the health and behavior of residents of Dunedin, New Zealand who were born between April 1972 and March 1973, following the individuals from ages 3 to 45. The assessment later in life found at least one adolescent  health condition  and an outcome measure, including the pace of aging, gait speed, brain age and facial age.  Data analysis was performed from Feb. 11, 2021 to Sept. 27, 2021. Asthma , cigarette smoking, obesity and psychological disorders were assessed at ages 11, 13 and 15.  According to the aging factor composite score, compared with those without those conditions, adolescents who smoked daily, were obese or had a psychological disorder diagnosis were  biologically  older at midlife. It was not the case for adolescents with asthma – which the group noted was in contrast to proposals from previous studies. OBESITY: MORE THAN HALF OF YOUNG ADULTS ARE OVERWEIGHT, STUDY SAYS Those with two or more comorbidities  were biologically older than those without any health conditions  Secondary analyses found that those with more health conditions had a faster pace of aging slower gait speed, older brain age and older facial age at midlife and aged nearly three months faster every year compared with participants who had none of the health conditions. They also walked 11.2 centimeters per second slower, had an older brain age by two-and-a-half years and had an older facial age by nearly four years than those who did not. The study's authors measured the pace of aging with repeated assessments of body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio, blood tests, hormones for regulating appetite and fat storage, blood pressure, cholesterol, tooth decay,  cardiorespiratory fitness  and brain MRIs. Asthma status was assessed using standardized interviews of participants by pulmonary specialists. Smoking status was assessed using self-reported cigarette smoking from in-person interviews.   Video The researchers also concluded that these conditions could be treated during adolescence to reduce the risk of accelerated biological aging later in life. ""Treating these modifiable pediatric health conditions could prevent the accumulation of chronic disease, development of disability, and risk of early death in adulthood by reducing the risk of accelerated biological aging,"" they concluded.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Limitations to the study include that the participants were predominantly White, other health conditions could also be relevant to midlife age and that the Dunedin Study was observational.

   Iowa  Gov.  Kim Reynolds  took to the airwaves Tuesday night to offer a blistering response to  President Biden 's  State of the Union  address – calling him out on a number of issues that have created economic hardships for Americans, including rising inflation, a surge in crime across American cities, his response to  COVID-19 , and ongoing international crises. ""Instead of moving America forward, it feels like President Biden and his party have sent us back in time to the late ‘70s and early ‘80s,"" the Republican said. ""When runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing on our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map."" ""Even before taking the oath of office, the president told us that he wanted to ‘make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home,’"" Reynolds continued. ""He’s failed on both fronts.""

       (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) Reynolds – who has pushed back against the Biden administration on a variety of issues, notably COVID-19 mandates – said the president's ""disastrous"" withdrawal from Afghanistan ""did more than cost American lives"" as it ""betrayed our allies and emboldened our enemies."" REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HIGHLIGHT CAUSES, SOLUTIONS TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ‘FOLLOW THE MONEY’ Reynolds, noting Biden's ""too little, too late"" approach to foreign policy, discussed the ongoing turmoil in Europe, calling Russia's ""full-scale"" invasion into Ukraine ""an attack on democracy, freedom, and the rule of law."" ""Now all Americans must stand united in solidarity with the brave people of Ukraine as they courageously defend their country against Putin’s tyranny,"" Reynolds said, noting the importance of America's ""military readiness."" Taking aim at Democrats, Reynolds said Biden and his party ""have spent the last year either ignoring the issues facing Americans or making them worse."" ""They were warned that spending trillions would lead to soaring inflation,"" she said. ""They were told their anti-energy policies would send gas prices to new heights. But they plowed ahead anyway, raising the price at the pump by 50% and pushing inflation to a 40-year high."" ""When I took the oath of office five years ago, I promised Iowans that I would never lose sight of who I was working for,"" Reynolds said.  ""That I wouldn’t become detached from the problems they were facing, from the problems I had faced myself. But you don’t have to check groceries to see what high inflation does to people. You just need to step outside the D.C. bubble. Talk to Americans about what’s on their mind. Ask them: What are your concerns? What keeps you up at night?""

""Well, the American people share that view. Enough is enough."" Reynolds said Americans are tired of a ""political class"" attempting to ""remake this country into a place where an elite few tell everyone else what they can and cannot say"" and what they ""can and cannot believe."" ""They’re tired of people pretending the way to end racism is by categorizing everybody by their race,"" the Iowa governor added.  ""They’re tired of politicians who tell parents they should sit down, be silent, and let government control their kids’ education and future. Frankly, they’re tired of the theater. Where politicians do one thing when the cameras are rolling and another when they believe you can’t see them."" Highlighting hypocrisy from Democrats, Reynolds said Americans are frustrated with governors and mayors who ""enforce mandates but don’t follow them,"" as well as elected leaders who ""tell their citizens to stay home while they sneak off to Florida for sun and fun"" and ""demand that your child wear a mask, but they go out maskless."" Noting a spike in crime, Reynolds said the Department of Justice ""treats parents like domestic terrorists but looters and shoplifters roam free,"" leaving working-class Americans to ""feel like they’re the enemy.""

""The president tried to paint a different picture tonight, but his actions over the last twelve months don’t match the rhetoric. It’s not what he promised when he took office. But it doesn’t have to be this way. There is an alternative."" Wrapping up her response, Reynolds targeted the administration for its handling of the pandemic as it relates to school children and its unwillingness to ""provide the resources to stop human trafficking. To stop the staggering influx of deadly drugs coming into our neighborhoods."" ""Republican governors faced the same COVID-19 virus head on,"" she said. ""But we honored your freedoms and saw right away that lockdowns and school closures came with their own significant costs – that mandates weren’t the answer. And we actually listened to the science, especially with kids in masks and kids in schools. What happened – and is still happening – to our children over the last two years is unconscionable. Learning loss. Isolation. Anxiety. Depression. In so many states, our kids have been left behind and many will never catch up."" ""I’m blessed to be the Governor of Iowa, where people are humble, hard-working, and patriotic,"" Reynolds concluded. ""We take care of each other. And yes, we are, as they say, Iowa Nice. But you don’t have to be from Iowa to see that those are the values of America at its best—all of America."" Since taking office last year, Biden has faced a number of crises in America and abroad. Rising inflation and other burdens placed on the American people due to the Biden administration's handling of the pandemic have plagued the country's economic recovery. A recent Fox News  poll  showed that only 31% of voters are satisfied with the direction the country is heading.

       (AP) Children have suffered a great deal from the pandemic lockdowns and have not been made a priority to regain normalcy as information evolved.  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic many restrictions, such as mask-wearing in schools, were quickly enforced through desperation to slow the transmission despite negligible data proving benefit. But there were a lot of unknowns during this time so an all-hands-on deck effort could be justified. However, by summer 2021 enough data emerged demonstrating cloth masks predominately had no perceptible benefit, and the low risk of severe COVID in children became apparent. Yet, no updates were made by the CDC regarding mask-wearing in schools. In fact, despite vaccines being readily available for everyone five years and older, it doubled down on its school masking recommendations as the less severe Omicron variant became dominant. Schools are not documented places of high-risk exposure for kids yet too many have been kept home through remote learning because of closures, having close contact exposure, and various other reasons. When in-person, they still have been distanced from others with faces remained covered, and they were discouraged from physically interacting with one another. This has remained despite data from as early as November 2020 from the CDC, UK, and other countries showing low risk of in-school transmission. While the U.S. is the only country to recommend children two years and older wear masks, other countries with less stringent mask recommendations began removing school mask requirements more than eight months ago without a sharp uptick in hospitalizations as a result. The CDC’s latest estimate through January 2022 show nearly 60 percent of kids have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Given the high level of transmissibility with Omicron, this number is much higher as we enter March 2022. Through vaccine and natural immunity, upward of 90 percent of kids likely have some level of immunity at this point. While vaccine and natural immunity have proven less capable of preventing future infections, their ability to lessen severe illness remain intact – similar to the flu shot.   Video Without any immunity, a child’s risk of severe illness falls much lower than during the preceding six flu seasons, a fact that has been evident since late 2020 as reported in BMJ Journal by Switzerland scientists. Even natural immunity has become politicized to the detriment of our kids. The large SIREN study looked at more than 30,000 participants and showed those who recovered from COVID-19 had a statistically significant lower risk of reinfection up to seven months (the length of the trial) after their first infection. This paper was published April 2021, yet the CDC neglected its findings while moving forward with universal vaccine and booster mandates segregating the population unnecessarily.  Regardless of political affiliation, as it stands today, there is no denying the overwhelming data demonstrate COVID poses little risk to children, there is no proven benefit to kids wearing cloth masks, and natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 offers protection from severe future COVID illness.   Video These are the facts. The science hasn’t miraculously changed in the last few months, but the situation has evolved as more people have become infected and been vaccinated.  There is a myriad of risks that our children face every day. Parenting is about balancing risks while allowing our kids to live life to the fullest. The pandemic is fluid. As it morphs into an endemic pathogen with seasonal upticks, parents must shun the groupthink mentality that disallows actions and opinions to change as the situation morphs. Our public health leaders and policymakers should have led the charge to dissipate fear rather than invoke a perpetual state of panic neglecting data along the way.   Video There will never be a time when removal of face masks will be universally welcomed just as our children will never live a day with zero risk to their well-being. The emotional safety net for people who were calling for vaccines to be available before removing masks should have been pulled when school age children were eligible to be vaccinated last fall.

   President Biden  on Tuesday announced new efforts to tackle the nation's  mental health  crisis as part of the ""Unity Agenda for the Nation."" In addition to boosting mental health, the initiative includes fighting the  opioid epidemic , helping  veterans  and ending  cancer . BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TOP 5 MOMENTS The president noted in his State of the Union  address  that  schoolchildren  have been especially impacted because of  COVID-19 pandemic  restrictions.  ""The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning,"" he said. ""I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part – sign up to be a tutor or a mentor."" He also called for the strengthening of privacy protections on  social media , a ban on targeted advertising to children and demanded that tech companies stop collecting personal data on children.

       (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) Biden said the nation ""must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit."" He pointed out that children were struggling due to social media harms, bullying, violence and trauma before the pandemic. ""Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care,"" he said. Earlier Tuesday, the  White House  wrote in a  release  that two out of five adults  report  symptoms of anxiety or depression, with Black and Brown communities  disproportionately  undertreated. NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED Grief and trauma from the pandemic – fueled by losses and disruptions in routines and relationships – have ""driven Americans to a "" breaking point ,"" with adolescents particularly affected.  The administration said the president's mental health strategy will aim to strengthen system capacity, connect more Americans to care and create a continuum of support. To do so, the government plans to strengthen crisis response infrastructure and expand the supply, diversity and cultural competency of the mental health and substance use disorder workforce.    Video The White House said it would invest in proven programs that bring providers into behavioral health, pilot new approaches to train a diverse group of paraprofessionals, build a national certification program for peer specialists, promote the mental well-being of frontline health workers, launch a ""988"" mental health crisis service hotline, expand the availability of evidence-based community mental health services and invest in research on new practice models.  In order to connect Americans to treatment, it also intends to expand and strengthen parity, integrate mental health and substance use treatment into primary care settings, improve access to same-day mental health care for veterans, expand access to telehealth and virtual mental health options and support in schools, embed and co-locate mental health and substance use providers into community-based settings and increase behavioral health navigation resources. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lastly, the fact sheet noted that a ""whole-of-society effort"" is needed to address concerns.  The administration will increase mental health resources for justice-involved populations, work to set students up for success in school, expand early childhood and school-based intervention services and supports, train social and human services professionals in basic mental health skills, invest in social media's mental harms, put a stop to discriminatory algorithmic decision-making and institute stronger online protections for young people.

   Deaths among older  Alzheimer's  patients surged 26% during the first year of the  COVID-19  pandemic, according to New Hampshire and Massachusetts researchers. In a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology, the group compared mortality rates for nearly 27 million  Medicare  enrollees in March-December 2019 with rates for slightly fewer enrollees in March through December 2020.  DAILY WALKS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S, NEW STUDY SAYS In addition, deaths for Medicare enrollees without the disease  increased  by more than 12% in 2020.  ""Thus, patients with ADRD experienced a 13.3% greater mortality risk than patients without ADRD from March through December 2020,"" the authors wrote.  In  nursing homes , the deaths of patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia (ADRD) increased by 33%, compared with 24% among those residents without Alzheimer's.  Among the Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations, deaths accelerated even faster than the overall ADRD population and a ""similar pattern of elevated mortality risk was observed"" among enrollees without ADRD. These results were even applicable among Alzheimer's patients in areas with low COVID-19 prevalence. VIAGARA MAY BE PROMISING DRUG CANDIDATE IN TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, STUDY FINDS ""We found that enrollees with ADRD were at higher risk of dying in 2020 compared with 2019, either directly of COVID-19 or because of premature death owing to disruptions in health care. These results hold both for patients with ADRD overall and for patients with ADRD residing in nursing homes,"" the researchers explained. The study examined all causes of death, using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the authors said it represents the ""largest examination"" of mortality trends among nursing home residents during the early phase of the pandemic. Because changes in health care delivery might disproportionately impact older adults with ADRD, the authors wrote that it is ""not difficult to imagine how the combination of less effective (or absent) outpatient care and lower inpatient admission rates led to higher mortality.""   Video As  telehealth  takes on a ""larger role"" in the delivery of health care, the study said it would be important to monitor the outcomes of older adults.  In addition, increases in caregiver stress, burden and isolation ""may have indirectly affected the health of people with ADRD and people living in nursing home settings,"" they noted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Limitations to the study include that nursing home patients may have been in alternative institutional settings who were not captured, that COVID-19 infection rates were likely understated line early 2020, changes in case mix may have occurred and that pandemic waves did not follow a uniform timeline and that they were unable to determine why some examined hospital referral regions (HRRs) fared better than others.   "

   U.S. travelers are still required by federal law to mask up on planes and trains, even after the  White House  and Congress dropped their mask mandates this week ahead of President Biden’s  State of the Union  address.

Zients added that the government will launch a website to ensure Americans can find tools at convenient locations later in March.  Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra later highlighted that the government has, thus far, distributed 690 million doses of vaccines, 4 million treatments, more than 270 million free N95s and free COVID-19 tests to 70 million households. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), he said, would further expand research and ramp up data sharing, with the possibility for launch new centers should Congress provide funding.  Becerra said the administration would coordinate a ""whole of government effort"" to support children and families who have experienced the loss of loved one due to COVID-19, as well as focus on strengthening  mental  and behavioral health services.  The secretary said HHS would continue to address the specific needs of seniors, people with disabilities and those who are immunocompromised.  NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED The 96-page  National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan  focuses on four key goals, including protecting against and treating the disease, preparing for new variants, preventing economic and educational shutdowns and continuing to lead the effort to vaccinate the world.  Zients said that the U.S. variant monitoring system is ready to respond and can now detect variants at a ""very low level.""  He said the plan would create stockpiles of personal protective equipment, tests and treatments and said that the plan would continue to ensure that schools, workers and workplaces have the resources they need.  That includes a new clean air in building checklist from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a request for Congress to reinstate tax credits to help small and mid-sized businesses with paid sick and family leave.  Lastly, Zients said that the president's plan includes continuing to donate more vaccines worldwide and ""doubling down on efforts to turn those vaccines into vaccinations.""

Media's 'weapon' Fauci no longer politically useful in Democrats' tough reelection bids: Sexton,Charles Creitz," March 2, 2022 7:33pm EST","  close     Video   Sexton: Fauci no longer politically useful with a frustrated electorate   Ex-CIA analyst and radio host Buck Sexton sounds off on COVID mandate politics NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   ORLANDO, Fla. –  In his speech to the  2022 CPAC  in Orange County, Fla., over the weekend, former CIA analyst and radio host  Buck Sexton  called for a ""housecleaning of the bureaucracy"" within the federal government, including health care establishment that imposed Draconian rules and restrictions on Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. Sexton  sat down with  Fox News Digital  at CPAC for a wide-ranging interview and expounded upon the points he made in his speech. ""The rapid fading of the COVID apparatus and the withdrawal from the constant appearances in the news cycle by the labcoat tyrant Fauci is a direct function of politics,"" said Sexton, explaining that NIAID Director  Dr. Anthony Fauci  was used as a ""weapon' within the federal bureaucracy – first against President Trump and later against any civilian dissidents of the Biden administration and its policies on that front.     
      MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace has referred to herself as a mask-loving ""Fauci groupie,"" in reference to her adoration of White House Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci.
       Sexton called the left's mitigation measures ""unscientific"" and said state governors who refused to impose such mandates ended up experiencing similar or better medical statistics than those who did. Northeastern governors like Pennsylvania's  Tom Wolf , New Jersey's  Phil Murphy , Delaware's  John Carney , North Carolina's Roy Cooper and West Coast governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Oregon's Kate Brown led the way in imposing forceful and often complex mandates – such as limiting hours of alcohol consumption at taverns  in one case  -- under threat of fines or other punishments. South Dakota's Kristi Noem, Florida's Ron DeSantis and Texas' Greg Abbott were seen as governors whose states ultimately fared similarly against COVID in the long term, but unlike many Democrats, did not impose restrictions on their citizens. ""I'm very proud to be one of the earliest outspoken conservatives against all of these measures, recognizing that they had never worked before and there was no scientific basis other than argument and then the suppression of arguments from the other side to believe that they would work now,"" Sexton said. TUCKER CONFRONTS NJ GOV OVER COVID MANDATES: ‘I WASN’T THINKING OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS WHEN WE DID THIS'     
      New Jersey Gov. Philip J. Murphy and Pennsylvania Gov. Thomas W. Wolf, both Democrats, instituted sweeping COVID mandates throughout 2020-21.
       ""This is driven by the political cycle. But then again, I argue, or I would argue that so were vaccine mandates. So were all of the different mask mandates. We've seen so much of what was pushed for COVID started out in the minds of the bureaucrats as something that might be worth trying. … And then it became an issue of political and tribal allegiance."" Many times, once authorities decided on a new mandate, the data on its effectiveness was often ignored, he added, pointing to states where there were no mask mandates. With the interview taking place prior to President Biden's State of the Union Tuesday, Sexton correctly predicted the White House would claim ""some kind of win"" after his fellow Democrats in control of Congress lifted the mask mandate in time for the nationally-televised address. ""I would argue that the numbers speak for themselves – more dead under Biden from COVID in the same period of time than in the initial stages of the pandemic without a vaccine from Trump. They cannot change those numbers,"" he said.  ""They cannot change the perception here. Biden on COVID could not be a bigger failure."" Sexton called or Fauci – one of the highest-paid bureaucrats who has worked at the NIH in Bethesda, Md., since 1968 – to be both ""repudiated professionally"" and investigated by Congress if Republicans are successful in taking back power later this year. Prior to the State of the Union, many Democratic governors like Murphy, Carney and Connecticut's Ned Lamont walked back their COVID-era restrictions. As Sexton previously noted on ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,"" Lamont drew criticism for claiming Connecticut residents have ""earned this freedom"". At CPAC, Sexton said he will work hard to make sure the American people do not forget over the next eight months what Fauci and the Democrats did to them, their families, and their occupations: ""I view it as my mission in life between now and Election Day to remind as many Americans as possible,"" Sexton told Fox News Digital.  SEXTON: ‘LABCOAT TYRANT’ FAUCI FEELING PRESSURE AS BEAGLE FLIES SCANDAL INTENSIFIES

       (REUTERS/Carlo Allegri) ""And I'm fortunate enough to be on a radio show with millions and millions of listeners, so I think we can have an impact,"" he said. ""My esteemed co-host Clay [Travis], and I, can have a real impact –  I view it as my mission in life to remind the American people that the Democrat Party on its own and against all common sense, data, and just basic human dignity, decided to mask, and I would argue, abuse children in schools for months and months beyond any reasonable interpretation of the data."" ""I view it as my mission in life to remind everyone who will listen that the Democrats drew circles in parks and told people, 'If you sit in this circle, you're more safe outside from the virus.'"" ""It's my mission to remind everybody that there were little footpads in elevators and on escalators telling people to stand six feet apart. And then it was three feet, and then it was 20 feet. And then, 'Oh gosh, we don't even know if this distancing thing did anything' -- And of course it didn't."" Later in the interview, Sexton discussed the Canadian trucker convoy protesting vaccine mandates and government overreach, the response by liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and the way American truckers have been recently inspired to make their own voices heard in Washington. Last week, a trucker from Biden's hometown of Scranton organized a convoy that traveled down Interstates 81 and 83 toward Baltimore and Washington to encircle the Capitol Beltway ""like a boa constrictor."" Since then, a transcontinental convoy set out from California to potentially enter the District of Columbia itself. Sexton said that it remains to be seen how the California convoy will comport itself in terms of protest. However, as the left-wing protests that often turned violent in 2020 showed, there have been many times Democrats in power have used protests ""as a weapon against those who disagree on entirely political lines."" ""So, a protest, or even a riot, that has a left-wing agenda attached to it is to be treated as a free-speech exercise even when it's dangerous and burning down buildings and attacking law enforcement officers,"" he said. ""And conservative protest is either shut down on phony COVID, ‘no mass gatherings’ grounds or, in this case, the claims that we saw in Canada about it being some neo-Nazi white nationalist, domestic terrorist threat – that was just the worst kind of lies.""

""I think it's very different here because a lot of people live in states that have not been subjected to the same degree of madness,"" he said. ""It might be harder to get the same kind of momentum as they saw in Canada, where it was really nationwide Fauciism,"" he added. ""But if they are peaceful, and they are about freedom and individual liberty… then I would stand with them and hope that everyone watches closely to see when the Biden administration is willing to call out men with truncheons and tell them to bludgeon people and when they're not. I think the politics drive that.""  "

   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced this week that it no longer recommends universal case investigation and contact  tracing . In its place, the agency said state, tribal, local and territorial (STLT) health departments should prioritize specific settings and groups at increased risk.  TIME MAGAZINE ADVISES READERS TO KEEP WEARING MASKS ON PLANES EVEN WHEN 'YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO' The updated  guidance  said those institutions should focus their efforts on promoting proven  prevention strategies  to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in the community.  Decisions to initiate contact tracing and case investigation should be made separately, with investigations targeting COVID-19 cases and close contacts with onsets and exposures in the previous 5 days for those settings and groups at increased risk. Additionally, STLT  health departments  should consult with  schools , businesses and organizations that provide essential services to help them implement appropriate COVID-19 prevention measures, support public health education, offer COVID-19  vaccinations  and have the authority to determine how case investigation and contact tracing should be implemented locally.

       (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) ""Case investigation and contact tracing are separate processes that have distinct benefits and outcomes,"" the CDC said. ""Implementation of each activity should be considered separately. Not all cases that are investigated will result in the elicitation and notification of close  contacts . It is important to prioritize investigation of COVID-19 cases with symptom onset or positive viral test within the previous 5 days. Notification of close contacts should occur within 5 days of their last known exposure to someone with COVID-19."" ""This time-based strategy will have the greatest impact on onward transmission and ensure priority cases and their priority close contacts can be reached in sufficient time follow recommended isolation and quarantine  guidance  and seek  treatment  as appropriate,"" the agency added.  The health departments should concentrate on the investigation of cases, clusters and outbreaks involving long-term care facilities, correctional facilities and  homeless  shelters, unusual clusters of cases and novel or emerging variants that could pose significant risks for severe disease, hospitalization and death.  WHY ARE COVID-19 VACCINATION RATES STILL LOW IN SOME COUNTRIES? Alternatively, the departments should emphasize elicitation and notification of close contact with exposure in the previous five days identified during the investigations, including those recommended for quarantine and those at increased risk of severe health outcomes and death.  However, the CDC noted that broad-based notification of potential exposure and testing ""may be more effective"" than contact tracing for responding to outbreaks and controlling  virus  transmission. As the recommendations adjust, the agency wrote that health departments may need to adjust staffing levels accordingly. Furthermore, to complement these activities, STLT health departments should offer vaccination and testing, implement testing strategies, connect those with COVID-19 who are at risk for severe health outcomes to antiviral and other treatments, encourage people who are positive to notify their own close contacts, expand the use of digital tools, promote the use of well-fitting masks and physical distancing in community settings and promote the benefits of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination.  These changes come as public health experts remain cautiously optimistic about current pandemic trends, with new cases and hospitalizations continuing to fall.  Data  from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center shows 52,355 new cases and nearly 2,100 new deaths in the past day.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP New York City's contact tracing program will  end  its universal tracing efforts toward the end of next month and Indiana state officials  announced  Thursday that its schools and child care programs will no longer have to conduct contact tracing or report COVID-19 cases to the state Department of Health as of next Wednesday.

   Why are  COVID-19   vaccination  rates still low in some countries? Limited supplies remain a problem, but experts say other challenges now include unpredictable deliveries, weak  health care  systems and vaccine hesitancy. HONG KONG REPORTS RECORD COVID-19 CASES; MOVEMENTS COULD BE RESTRICTED Most countries with low vaccination rates are in  Africa . As of late February, 13 countries in Africa have fully vaccinated less than 5% of their populations, according to Phionah Atuhebwe, an officer for the  World Health Organization’s  regional office for Africa.

       (AP Photo/Nardus Engelbrecht) For most of last year, developing nations were plagued by a lack of supplies. Rich countries were hoarding doses and many countries didn’t have the facilities to make their own vaccines. COVAX — an initiative to distribute vaccines equally around the world — faltered in delivering shots. Many rich countries had planned to donate doses once their own populations were vaccinated, but the emergence of the delta and omicron variants spurred booster campaigns that further delayed those plans. Vaccine makers have largely declined to share their formulas or  technology , further restricting production. WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE PLAN Other setbacks to vaccinations have also emerged. ""The main problem among countries with low vaccination rates is poor infrastructure to distribute shots,""  says  Dina Borzekowski, director of the Global Health Initiative at the University of Maryland. ""What is absent are best practices to get vaccines to populations who typically live without safely managed sanitation systems or reliable electricity.""   Video Donated vaccines are also sometimes delivered close to their expiration dates, giving  health  officials little time to distribute them, says Sinhye Ha of Doctors Without Borders. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some countries also lack materials like syringes to inject the shots or ways to keep the vaccines at the right temperature. Vaccine hesitancy fueled by misinformation and a distrust of governments has also contributed to low vaccine uptake in some countries, says Atuhebwe.  "

In nearby Pennsylvania, Philadelphia health officials  announced  Wednesday that the city was lifting its indoor mask mandate.  Officials expect to lift the shoo masking rules there on March 9.  To the South, the city health director for New Orleans, Louisiana,  said  Wednesday that the Big Easy is lifting its indoor mask mandate now that the annual Carnival season is over.  TIME MAGAZINE ADVISES READERS TO KEEP WEARING MASKS ON PLANES EVEN WHEN 'YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO' The mask mandate ended Thursday morning and a requirement for customers to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test for entry into bars, restaurants or other venues is slated to end on March 21 – should hospitalization rates remain stable. With new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations falling across the country, the CDC's new  guidelines  included new county-by-county color designations to indicate whether residents should wear masks or not.  Based on its risk map, more than 70% of the U.S. population is in counties where the coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals. The agency is still advising people, including schoolchildren, wear masks where the risk of COVID-19 is high, or about 37% of U.S. counties.

   Noe Landini, the managing director of several popular restaurants in the nation's capital, blasted the decision to  lift vaccine and mask mandates  throughout  Washington, D.C. , as ""extremely political."" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced last month that both the city-wide  COVID-19  vaccine and mask mandates would be lifted by the beginning of March. Last week, a few days ahead of President Biden's  State of the Union address , the White House and Capitol made a similar announcement.  Landini criticized the decisions in an interview with Fox News Digital at the ""Covid Madness: Meet the D.C. Business Owners Fighting for Freedom"" event at the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday.  ""You don’t need to be a doctor,"" Landini said. ""At the beginning of this, if you remember, it was all about following the science. And then somewhere along the lines, we stopped talking about science.

CBS' Gayle King, meanwhile,  told  late night host Stephen Colbert that she was ""so tired"" of being afraid of COVID and that she'd rather run through Times Square ""buck naked"" than be locked down again.

They want to get on with their lives. And I think that the administration has recognized that and because more people than not are over it, that was the safe call to make. Definitely a political call."" Eric Flannery, owner of the Big Board restaurant, said at Wednesday's panel he had done some ""soul-searching"" when D.C.'s mandates were enforced and decided he was not going to comply with the city's orders, saying he's ""not a government agent."" The Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration stripped him of his liquor license for failing to enforce masks for its employees and checking patrons' vaccine cards, and the restaurant was soon forced to close.

""We're just not going to take part in any state-sponsored discrimination of any kind,"" he said. ""We just won't.

""When the CDC official says, ‘oh we are reluctant to make this public because that might be interpreted as the vaccines being ineffective’, well that’s what we’ve been watching all along,"" Roy said. ""While social media led by all these so-called experts basically have a political agenda to make everybody believe that vaccines work no matter what."" Roy added that the mere fact that the CDC has changed the definition of vaccinated over the course of the last 15 months shows that the motivations behind guidances are political. ""At first it was ‘don’t worry the vaccine stops you from getting it’ and then ‘oh crap that’s not true but we’ll kind of gloss over that,’"" Roy recalled, adding that President Biden  said  last year that ""you’re not going to get COVID"" if you are vaccinated.

""On masking, you go back in March 2020 it was, wear a mask if you’re sick and if you’re not sick you don’t need to wear a face mask, then it converted to everyone should wear a mask outside, then it became masks need to be worn to protect those around you,"" Roy said. ""Then almost a year ago it was fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear a mask then fully vaccinated people had to wear a mask inside. In January of this year, cloth masks offer the least protection and we recommend N95. It’s just crazy. And then it changed at the State of the Union. It’s just nuts.""

   The coronavirus pandemic has gone on more than two years, and the emotional fights over masking have spilled over into many memorable media moments. From ""Saturday Night Live"" to ""The View"" to an MSNBC camera crew, here are 10 memorable media moments involving the fierce face-covering debate. Sunny Hostin suggests she'd want to hit Ron DeSantis for telling teenagers to take off their masks As part of what one watchdog called a ""meltdown"" in liberal media, ""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin seeemed to suggest Thursday that she would have hit Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, R., if he had spoken to one of her children the way he addressed teens at a University of South Florida event this week.  ""You do not have to wear those masks,"" DeSantis told masked high school students Wednesday as he walked up to a podium at the University of South Florida. ""Please take them off. Honestly, it's not doing anything. We've gotta stop with this COVID theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous."" DESANTIS ASKING STUDENTS TO TAKE OFF MASKS RESULTS IN MEDIA ‘MELTDOWNS’ DESPITE MASKLESS SOTU ADDRESS DeSantis' brusque tone raised media hackles, and Hostin said she might have done something that was not ""legal"" if she had been present. ""He gave them bad public health information,"" she said. ""If that were my kid there, I don't know what I would do … I don't know if it would be legal. It's just so inappropriate to see that from a leader. I would go nuts."" ‘ Saturday Night Live’ pokes fun at masking, coronavirus theatrics A skit on the NBC comedy show last week showed three sets of couples nervously admitting out loud that perhaps the rhetoric over shifting science, dining regulations, and arbitrary mask rules was nonsense all along. After one character brings up an article that potentially mask mandates had no effect on the virus, the eaters become anxious and start to question conventional wisdom on vaccinations and masks. ""Look, I went to a child’s birthday party, self-careful,"" says a woman played by Kate McKinnon, ""and they did gymnastics in masks ... and then they went into another room and took off their masks to eat pizza — this is the end of me — so did they really need the mask or no? DID ANY OF US EVER NEED THE MASK?"" A similar skit in 2018 mocked liberal anxieties over discussing the possible pitfalls of the #MeToo movement. MSNBC host declares one month before Biden went maskless at State of the Union that it's ‘gaslighting’ to say people don't want mask mandates A defiant Mehdi Hasan defended a tweet last month calling for keeping mask mandates in schools and expanding the Supreme Court, and cited a survey that showed a majority of Americans still wanted indoor mask mandates.

MONTAGE: BIDEN OFFICIALS ALWAYS CLAIM TO ‘FOLLOW THE SCIENCE’ ON CORONAVIRUS MASKING Less than a month later, President Biden could be seen without a mask, laughing and shaking hands with maskless Democrats after his State of the Union address. More Democratic-led states are lifting mask mandates indoors and in schools as well. Bill Maher says he's done: I don't want to live in your ‘masked paranoid world’ anymore HBO host Bill Maher infuriated liberal media members in January when he effectively said he was done with COVID, criticizing the ""masked paranoid world"" some people were still living in. ""I don’t want to live in your paranoid world anymore, your masked paranoid world. You know, you go out, it’s silly now. You know, you mask, you have to have a card, you have to have a booster, they scan your head. Like you’re a cashier, and I’m a bunch of bananas. I’m not bananas. You are,"" Maher said. Independent journalist Bari Weiss agreed, as the two decried the prolonged lockdowns and continued masking rules that have defined the past two years, with Weiss calling it a ""pandemic of bureaucracy."" Both are fully vaccinated and have touted their effectiveness – Maher got coronavirus late last year but had mild symptoms – but have stood out in the media with their desire for a return to normalcy. CNN'S ACOSTA, LIBERAL MEDIA MELT DOWN OVER BARI WEISS' COVID REMARKS: ‘GROW UP’ ""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg, CNN's Jim Acosta, MSNBC's Mehdi Hasan, and other media figures fumed over Maher and Weiss afterward. ""How dare you be so flippant, man?"" an outraged Goldberg said. Sara Haines suggests she'll wear masks indoors permanently  ""The View"" co-host Sara Haines remarked in January that part of the ""new normal"" in the COVID and post-COVID era could mean people like her engaging in permanent indoor mask-wearing. ""I may never ride a subway again without a mask. I may never go indoors to big crowds and ever feel comfortable without a mask, and that's up to me to do that,"" Haines said. On Twitter, after a news site clipped her remarks, Haines maintained she opposed shutdowns, school closures and mask mandates for future, less severe variants of the virus like omicron, given the availability of vaccines. Liberal media scolds Youngkin for fulfilling campaign promise to end mask mandates in schools: ‘Kids will die’ Newly inaugurated Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R., received withering criticism in liberal media circles in January after fulfilling a campaign pledge to allow parents to opt out of school mask mandates. In one particularly over-the-top moment, CNN analyst and former Clinton White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declared ""kids will die"" as a result of Youngkin's decision. Liberal media figures have  repeatedly overstated  the danger of COVID-19 to children, couching their hyper-caution in concern for the well-being of youngsters.

   Even Hamilton Beach couldn’t make enough mixers to keep up with the mixed messaging on Capitol Hill this week.  Congress  initially seemed divided about  COVID protocols  before  President Biden’s   State of the Union  speech. All  House  and  Senate  members were invited this year – compared to the 200 last year due to the pandemic. Initial guidelines dictated members had to sit spaced apart in the chamber. Even some members would sit in the gallery above rather than on the floor. No handshakes or backslapping. All members had to have a negative COVID test and wear a mask to take part. Democrats  hold the majority in the  House  and  Senate .  President Biden  is a Democrat. Democrats faced a conundrum. They’re trying desperately to ease the nation into some degree of normalcy and demonstrate a path out of the pandemic – especially ahead of the midterms. A fully-masked State of the Union speech would not present that optic.  In a memo, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker declared that lawmakers who refused to don a mask or adhere to other protocols risked getting kicked out of the speech.

       RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES We now live in the age of performative politics and  TikTok . One could only imagine how some GOP lawmakers would have  relished  the opportunity to make a scene getting bounced from the speech over COVID practices. Such dramatics would go viral and resonate in some conservative districts. Republicans would embrace casting blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who they criticize regularly for ""locking down the Capitol."" The House Ethics Committee has already fined Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., more than $100,000 for failing to wear a mask in the House chamber.  The Ethics Committee just announced this week that the Sergeant at Arms Office fined Greene for three violations alone on January 20. But the Capitol Attending Physician along with many other jurisdictions, began to dial back masking mandates on March 1, the day of the speech.  And so, no masks were required for State of the Union. Sure. A few wore masks on their own. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., ""because we all need to remember that the immunocompromised and those over 60 remain at higher risk of severe illness."" He said it was important to wear a mask ""for those who are vulnerable.""  Reps. Al Green, D-Tex., and Jim Langevin, D-R.I., were also spotted with masks. So, the State of the Union speech seemed and looked kind of normal. It wasn’t completely full. Congressional officials only permitted about 600 persons in the chamber. They can typically pack in 1,600 for a completely bulging State of the Union in a non-pandemic period.

President Biden lingered in the chamber for 17 minutes after his remarks concluded, signing copies of the speech and talking with lawmakers. Unartfully, Democrats got the political optic they needed. But something else happened on State of the Union day which never unfolded before during the pandemic. A record six lawmakers tested positive for COVID. Reps. Dwight Evans, D-Penn., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., Ted Deutch, D-Fla. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., all tested positive. No more than two members ever tested positive on any one day during the entire pandemic. Granted, there may have been so many positive tests because members sought out tests to gain admittance to the speech. But six positives – just for members – is significant. Congress has proven itself to be a reliable barometer as to where the country stands with COVID. A spike in cases among members usually mirrors a spike in cases around the country. A good example came in December. Lawmakers began contracting COVID just before Christmas as the omicron wave spread. The numbers shot up on Capitol Hill in January, mimicking national coronavirus stats. Then the numbers dipped precipitously in Congress – matching the decline around the country.  Either way, the outbreak of cases, pitted against an unmasked speech, doesn’t mesh. Then there is the internal squabbling on both sides of the aisle which also sends mixed messages. Democrats find themselves at odds over addressing energy needs amid the war in  Ukraine . The price for a barrel of oil skyrocketed to $111 Wednesday.  Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. , is pushing for an increase in domestic oil production. Republicans are appropriating the Ukraine crisis to push the Biden Administration to approve pipeline construction and leases for drilling.  But there’s a schism. Manchin’s ideas run crossways with progressives and those pushing the Green New Deal. Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. , said she was disappointed President Biden didn’t address climate change in the speech. Senate Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,  sidestepped a question from yours truly when asked if Manchin’s energy ideas were problematic for the core of the Democratic Party.

We are focused very strongly. You’re going to hear a lot more from us on those issues in the future.""  But there was dissonance on the GOP side, too.  At the outset of the Cold War, late Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, R-Mich., said that foreign policy ""stopped at the water’s edge."" In today’s toxic political environment, the water’s edge qualifies as an EPA Superfund site.  Fox News  asked House Minority Leader  Kevin McCarthy,  R-Calif., if there was danger for the GOP to hypercriticize President Biden during an international crisis or if they could strike a balance. Especially for State of the Union. ""Are we going to sit down and be quiet? No,"" replied McCarthy. ""We’re not going to sit quietly by."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,  R-Ky., said there was ""broad support"" for President Biden’s approach to Ukraine. ""But what took him so long?""

   People infected with COVID-19 are at risk of having a cardiovascular disease-related incident 30 days after having been infected by the virus, researchers showed in a recent report in the journal  Nature Medicine.   The report found those with COVID-19 are potentially susceptible to developing 20 different heart and vascular diseases including among others: heart failure, pericarditis, myocarditis, stroke, cerebrovascular disorders, and dysrhythmias. Even individuals who were not hospitalized with the infection were found to have developed more cardiovascular disease than those who were never infected, the study said.  ""There were 20 cardiac disorders that were diagnosed for those patients that are suffering from long haul COVID. The most common is the shortness of breath and fatigue,"" Dr. Evelina Grayver, MD, the Director of women’s  heart health  program at Northwell Health in NY told Fox News. ""The new arrhythmias, or the abnormal heart rhythms that people experience, are significant as well and can become incredibly handicapping for a lot of patients,"" Grayver who did not participate in the study, but commented to Fox News.

       ( APU GOMES/AFP via Getty Images) The researchers analyzed health records of more than 11 million U.S veterans and found veterans who had COVID-19 one year earlier, had a significantly increased risk for 20 different heart and vessel conditions, compared with those who did not. ""In regards to long-haul COVID and cardio symptoms it has been an array of anything from significant shortness of breath to palpitations to simply an inability to complete a workout,"" Grayver told Fox News.  Dr. Grayver told Fox News, that many patients who suffer  cardiovascular effects  of long COVID-19 like myocarditis are afraid to exercise but said exercise can play an important role in recovery, including her own after contracting COVID-19.  ""Unfortunately, because I suffered from the same diagnosis for a while, I understand it too well. If the heart function has completely recovered, it is a matter of trying to push yourself a little bit at a time every single day. People with history of myocarditis and with the fear of exercise should take part in a cardiac rehab program,"" Grayver said in the interview. The cardiologist told Fox that many centers have opened up to enable people, who are recovering from  COVID-19 , to exercise in a controlled environment. ""When patients are able to start their exercise regimen in a controlled environment, where they are being closely monitored in regards to their EKG, blood pressure and heart rate, they feel a lot more comfortable and safer to continue with their exercise outside of the cardiac rehab centers,"" Grayver told Fox News.      
      Patients in hospital beds wait in a temporary holding area.
       (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) Grayver explained in some cases when an individual is infected with COVID, a significant physiologic change could occur in muscle and cardio conditioning. The doctor explained, ""If you take a healthy person and you put them into bed for 24 hours, immediately their muscles will begin to atrophy. Same thing happens during the time of Covid."" Grayver further explained that exercise can address this deconditioning. ""Especially when you target certain type of exercise that deals with high intensity interval training. That not only changes your heart to manage from going up and down, it helps to regenerate some of that muscle they could’ve atrophied during the time of their illness.""  Health experts told Fox News it is important for patients recovering from COVID to get  clearance  to begin an exercise program.  The cardiologist explained ""I approach these patients as if they’ve recently had a cardiac procedure. Meaning, I sent them for a baseline  exercise  stress test to assess their basic functional status. Based upon the results of that exercise stress test, i then refer them to cardiac rehab.""  Grayver added, ""That usually helps them significantly. Once they complete the program, they feel physically, mentally and emotionally stronger to continue with their own independent exercise regimen"" For patients with underlying lung pathology issues Grayver suggested individuals keep a close eye on the pulse oximetry. ""If patients are suffering from significant cardiac deconditioning and possible arrhythmias, heart rate monitoring will definitely help. And in order to set the guidelines in reference to how high or low anybody’s heart rate should go, getting that baseline exercise stress test would be important."" Grayver shared how exercise helped her recover from COVID.   ""There were many moments of significant frustration because I truly felt uncomfortable in my own skin. But every day I pushed myself a little bit longer, I lifted a little bit heavier, I ran at a steeper incline. Those small little changes continue to push me both mentally and physically. Putting it back into my hands, getting that power back into my body, it started to help me.""

   Friday marks World  Obesity  Day.  According to the  World Health Organization (WHO)  more than 1 billion people around the world are obese.  LOW-CARB DIET BENEFITS HEART HEALTH FOR OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE, RESEARCHERS SAY The agency  said  that tally includes, 650 million adults, 340 million adolescents and 39 million children – with the number still increasing.  The WHO estimates that approximately 167 million people will become less  healthy  because they are overweight or obese by 2025.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity prevalence in the U.S. was  42.4%  from 2017 to 2018.  Some groups were impacted more than others, and non-Hispanic Black adults had the highest age-adjusted prevalence of obesity, at 49.6%.  For children and adolescents aged 2-19 years old from 2017 to 2018, the prevalence of obesity was  19.3%  and affected about 14.4 million children and adolescents. OBESITY: MORE THAN HALF OF YOUNG ADULTS ARE OVERWEIGHT, STUDY SAYS According to the agency, obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer – which are among the leading causes of preventable, premature death. The WHO – which is urging countries to act to reverse this health crisis – explained that obesity affects the heart liver kidneys, joints and reproductive system. Additionally, the agency pointed out that those with obesity are three times more likely to be hospitalized for  COVID-19 .    Video While the key to preventing obesity is acting early, the WHO said countries need to work together to create a ""better  food  environment"" for everyone.  ""Effective steps include restricting the marketing to children of food and drinks high in fats, sugar and salt, taxing sugary drinks, and providing better access to affordable, healthy food. Cities and towns need to make space for safe walking, cycling, and recreation, and schools need to help households teach children healthy habits from early on,"" it said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The WHO said it is monitoring global trends and prevalence, developing guidance to address the prevention and treatment of obesity and those who are overweight and providing implementation support and guidance for countries.  An ""acceleration action plan to stop obesity"" from the WHO secretariat will be discussed at the 76 World Health Assembly in May.

Biden's State of the Union unmasks the politics of the CDC,Nat Malkus Tracey Schirra," March 4, 2022 7:00am EST","  close     Video   Media coverage of Democratic governors lifting school mask mandates the 'height of hypocrisy': DeVos   Former education secretary Betsy DeVos calls out the media over their coverage of liberal governors changing course on school mask mandates on 'The Story.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Late last Friday, the CDC released new guidance that drastically reduced indoor masking recommendations. Prior guidance recommended more than 90 percent of Americans and 100 percent of public school students mask indoors. Under the new guidance, the CDC recommends just 29 percent of Americans and just 31 percent of public school students do so. The question to ask is not why the CDC made this dramatic change. It’s, why now? RESTAURANT OWNER RIPS CITY OFFICIALS, WHITE HOUSE FOR ‘EXTREMELY POLITICAL’ DECISIONS TO LIFT MASK MANDATES     
      A pedestrian removes a protective mask worn as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus in Philadelphia, Wednesday, March 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) 
       The answer seems clear—the CDC bent to political pressure from the Biden administration. Since the Omicron peak, opinion pages have increasingly challenged the CDC’s overly restrictive recommendations. State after state ended their own mandates as COVID cases subsided and as the public’s trust—and practices—grew increasingly out of step with CDC guidance. Last Friday, only seven states maintained mask mandates, while over half of public school students attended mask optional schools. If the CDC was confident that 70 percent of the public need not wear masks, why did it wait so much longer than states did to announce this? And why in a late Friday news dump? If school specific masking requirements were unnecessary, why keep blanket school recommendations for so long?   Video The reason it happened on Friday is clear. The announcement paved the way for President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address. Under the new guidance, President Biden was able to enter the House chamber unmasked and trumpet that ""Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free… COVID-19 need no longer control our lives."" Regarding schools, Biden shrugged off indifference evident one week prior to say, ""Most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom, and move forward safely."" This timing seems more than just convenient. In mid-February, NBC reported, senior White House officials asked CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to update the mask guidance prior to the State of the Union. NBC noted, ""The White House has been eager for the CDC to provide an update on its indoor mask recommendation, although it wants the agency to get it right, and it doesn’t want to appear as though it is putting political pressure on the agency.""

       (Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images) On this count, the administration failed spectacularly. CDC’s timing appears to be motivated by political expediency and little else. After all, no new scientific breakthroughs or studies spurred this change. And while the new guidance does use better data—adding county COVID-19 hospitalizations and hospital bed occupancy data to the COVID-19 case rate data—that data has been available for months. The only ""pressure on the agency"" that explains the timing of Friday’s announcement is political pressure. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Potential interference from the administration is a profound concern. It undermines the already fragile trust the public has in the CDC as an independent scientific agency. The CDC’s failure to act before now also points to significant failings within it, raising another question: How much longer might the CDC have waited if not for pressure from the State of the Union? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In light of such glaring circumstantial evidence, Congress should investigate whether the Biden administration put pressure on the CDC. They can start by requesting early drafts of the State of Union to determine whether the administration anticipated the CDC announcement. If so, Congress should probe into their role in that decision. If the CDC’s change was merely a happy coincidence for Biden’s address, Congress should hold the CDC to account for delaying guidance that affects the lives of millions of American schoolchildren. Congress not only has the prerogative, but the responsibility to investigate.  "

County updates to this map will come weekly.    Video All of this comes a week after the CDC  loosened  its masking guidance, allowing Americans to take a break from wearing masks in certain areas.  The new set of measures shifted from a focus on positive test rules and more on hospitals.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The new recommendations do not change the requirement to wear masks on public transportation and in transportation hubs. The current transit mask order expires on March 18, but may be extended.  In addition, those with COVID-19 symptoms or who test positive should not stop wearing masks.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.   "

       The group was planning to leave its staging area at 8 a.m. to circle the Beltway around D.C., according to the People’s Convoy website. Brian Brase, a convoy organizer, was heard telling members of his group that they would avoid driving into D.C. proper on Monday and Tuesday, and instead stick to the surrounding roadways, the  Daily Wire  reported. Brase described the decision as ""diplomatic moves"" meant to protect members of the convoy. ""I am fearful … of them trying to do to us what they did to those involved in January 6. It is our belief that they will try to do that….That means at this time, meaning today, tomorrow, we are not and will not go into DC proper,"" Brase said.

   FIRST ON FOX : More than 30  House Republicans  are urging the  Biden administration  to end COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truckers and agricultural workers coming across the U.S. border, warning that the mandates risk having a ""catastrophic effect"" on the supply chain crisis. The Department of Homeland Security in January began requiring non-U.S.citizens coming across the border via ports of entry to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19. That includes truck drivers and workers coming across on H-2A temporary agricultural worker visas. GOP SENATORS RENEW EFFORTS TO DEFUND BIDEN'S VACCINE MANDATES  While cities across the country, including those with vaccine mandates, have started rolling back COVID-19 restrictions, there are no signs they will be relaxed at the border -- including ports of entry. COVID-19 restrictions also remain in place for those crossing the border illegally in the form of Title 42.

       In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejadro Mayorkas, 36 lawmakers led by  Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C.  point out the ongoing supply chain crisis and the worker shortage the country is currently facing, which requires an increase in the number of agricultural workers being brought into the U.S. ""Now that these H-2A workers are required to be fully vaccinated to enter the U.S., we have heard from numerous farmers and constituents who worry that these new vaccination requirements are delaying and will continue to delay the arrival of H-2A workers this year,""  the lawmakers wrote . ""These limitations and delays will have a catastrophic impact on our already fragile supply chain and proliferate rising food prices."" 3.7 GOP Letter to DHS  by  Fox News  on Scribd   Many H-2A workers come from Mexico, and the lawmakers argue that vaccine availability varies widely across Mexico, and some of the vaccines available are not accepted by the U.S. The lawmakers urge the Biden administration to allow for an exemption for that reason. ""Despite the historic supply and labor shortages, the Biden administration has upheld this restrictive vaccine mandate,"" Norman told Fox News in a statement. ""Agricultural employers already depend on nonimmigrant foreign workers to fill domestic labor shortages.

   California  state regulators conducted an investigation at a  San Diego  preschool and privately interviewed children as young as 2 without their parents’ consent about their masking practices. Officials with the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) visited all three locations of Aspen Leaf Preschool in January after receiving a complaint that the  school  was not enforcing the state’s mask mandate, according to the CDSS’ response to a complaint by the preschool’s owner, Howard Wu. NYC PARENTS PLAN TO SUE THE MAYOR OVER MASK MANDATES FOR YOUNG KIDS According to the CDSS letter, which Wu shared with Fox News Digital, officials with the agency’s Community Care Licensing Division entered the three preschool locations on Jan. 19, separated the children from their teachers and interviewed them privately about their masking practices.  In his complaint to the agency, Wu described the investigation as a ""simultaneous, multi-school raid"" that resulted in ""unnecessary and inappropriate child interviews."" ""Every family we heard from after the inspections were furious about the interviews,"" Wu told Fox News Digital. ""We were open the whole pandemic about not masking children and the reasons why. The policy was on our website. Put simply, the mask guidance says children can NOT mask when eating and sleeping. In full day child care that’s 3 hours, so masking at other times offers no health benefit. All the families (except 1 in January) supported the policy."" Wu also argues that the CDSS does not have the authority to enforce a mask mandate instituted by another agency, in this case the California Department of Public Health. ""We believe in good faith that the agency doesn’t have jurisdiction to enforce another agency’s mask guidance,"" he said. ""They could have issued us a citation in 5 minutes and let us take our challenge up through the proper channels. The simultaneous multi-school raids and the child interviews just felt like a power play."" In its response to Wu, the CDSS said it holds the authority to ""enter and inspect a licensed child care facility at any time, with or without advance notice, to secure compliance with, or prevent a violation"" of state laws, as well as ""interview children without prior consent and, when necessary, conduct the interviews in private."" ""Based on their personal observations and interviews of the facility directors, staff and children, CCLD staff determined that the licensee failed to ensure that staff and children used face coverings as required by the State Public Health Officer Order of June 11, 2021, thus violating the children’s personal right to safe and healthful accommodations,"" the letter said. The agency has issued Aspen Leaf a Type A citation, the most severe violation type,  Voice of San Diego reported .  In response to the citation, which Aspen Leaf said it is appealing, the school has  updated its COVID-19 policy  to require masks on all children over 2 until the state’s mandate ends on March 11. In his official complaint, Wu included multiple complaints by  parents  who were outraged over the CPSS investigation. ""I do not feel this interview served my child’s safety or well-being,"" wrote one parent, ""and I believe it may have given a harmful impression about her obligations to speak with strange adults in private without known caretakers present.""  ""I understand that while the licensing agency is authorized to conduct private interviews with the children – this authority was put in place and intended for use when there is a situation of possible abuse, which is ENTIRELY absent from this situation,"" wrote another parent. ""Therefore, this agency has blatantly overstepped their authority."" ""Frustrated. Angry. Aghast. Confused,"" another parent wrote. ""These are only a few of the words that describe what we felt as parents of a 3.5 year old who was questioned by government officials at his preschool regarding mask-wear indoors."" Wu said he believes his preschool was unfairly targeted because he challenged the CDSS’ authority. ""After it all happened I actually pulled every licensing report issued in California during the pandemic to get the data to show we were treated more harshly than any other center,"" he told Fox News Digital. Wu  published the data on a website  he created declaring, ""California has a child care crisis,"" and ""the child care licensing agency is making things worse."" When reached by Fox News Digital, the CCLD provided its written response to the parents who complained. ""We want to ensure you that CCLD takes seriously its responsibility of ensuring the health and safety of children in licensed child care facilities,"" read the March 1 letter from CCLD deputy director Kevin Gaines. ""It is for this reason that CCLD spoke with your child."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""CCLD has confirmed that conversations with children during the complaint investigation were conducted with Aspen Leaf staff present or within line of sight of Aspen Leaf staff,"" the letter stated. ""CCLD has determined that the interviews were conducted in an appropriate manner and were a necessary component of the required complaint investigation."" ""A licensing evaluator is respectful of a child’s choice to answer questions,"" it added. ""If at any point during an interview a child expresses or exhibits apprehension or discomfort, the interview is discontinued.""  "

   Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo's announcement that the state would recommend healthy children not get the  coronavirus vaccine  generated a strong  media  reaction on Monday. Ladapo made the remarks at the end of a COVID-19 policy roundtable with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, R., whose coronavirus policies against mask and vaccine mandates have won him national admirers, as well as strong detractors. Ladapo said Florida is ""going to be the first state to officially recommend against the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children."" Coronavirus vaccines are currently available for anyone ages 5 and up, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommend  everyone in that age range get vaccinated. DESANTIS ASKING STUDENTS TO TAKE OFF MASKS RESULTS IN MEDIA ‘MELTDOWNS’ DESPITE MASKLESS SOTU ADDRESS In a press release on Tuesday, the Florida Department of Health recommended that ""children with underlying conditions are the best candidates for the COVID-19 vaccine."" It said, for healthy minors, the high prevalence of existing natural immunity, the low chance already of severe outcomes from coronavirus, and the risk of heart inflammation (myocarditis), particularly among adolescent males, were all factors to take into consideration before getting vaccinated.  Other experts have noted that heart inflammation is worse for those who actually contract the virus than those who have adverse reactions from the vaccine. The CDC  did recommend  last month, however, that younger males wait eight weeks between doses of the two-shot mRNA vaccine schedule to reduce the risk.     
      Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Gov. Ron DeSantis at a news conference in West Palm Beach, Florida on Thursday, Jan. 6, 2022.
       (Joe Cavaretta/Sun Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) ""In general, healthy children with no significant underlying health conditions under 16 years old are at little to no risk of severe illness complications from COVID-19. For adolescents 16 to 17 years of age, the risk of myocarditis due to the COVID-19 vaccines may outweigh the benefits,"" Florida's guidance read. It also quoted advisors to the Food and Drug Administration who recommended the vaccine for children with medical conditions. The state's guidance has prompted extensive coverage. ""To date, 49 states have accepted the CDC’s recommendations — though Florida’s defiance may very well encourage officials in red states to do the same,"" MSNBC's Steve Benen wrote, outlining controversies from Ladapo's prior tenure at UCLA. ""Many Florida families will see Ladapo’s title and assume the state’s official surgeon general must know what he’s talking about, or he wouldn’t be the state’s official surgeon general. Traditionally, that might’ve been a safe assumption. In Florida in 2022, skepticism of Ladapo’s advice is probably the safer course."" Former New Yorker writer James Surowiecki said Ladapo's remarks played into his ""track record of crankery,"" and HuffPost wrote his decision ""ignores overwhelming evidence about the safety and efficacy of the shots."" ""This puts Florida at odds with most other states and with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it certainly doesn’t put Ladapo at odds with DeSantis,"" the Washington Post wryly noted. CHICAGO TEACHERS VOW TO FIGHT ORDER TO DROP MASK MANDATES, PUERTO RICO LIFTS RESTRICTIONS ""Several studies have shown that even though vaccine efficacy against infection wanes over time, the immune response remains highly protective against hospitalization and death, even against the highly contagious Omicron variant,"" the New York Times noted in its report.

       (AP Newsroom) White House press secretary Jen Psaki, asked by a reporter Monday if it was ""good policy,"" responded, ""Absolutely not."" ""Let me just note that we know the science, we know the data and what works and what is the most — what the most effective steps are in protecting people of a range of ages from hospitalization and even death,"" she said, adding, ""It’s deeply disturbing that there are politicians peddling conspiracy theories out there and casting doubt on vaccinations when it is our best tool against the virus and the best tool to prevent even teenagers from being hospitalized."" Fox News contributor Dr. Nichole Saphier said there was no room for absolutism on either side of the issue, whether people were completely against the vaccination of any children or wanted them all vaccinated, regardless of whether they had natural immunity or underlying medical conditions.  ""We're trying to maximize benefit and minimize adverse events of the vaccine,"" she said. ""You have to take into account whether someone has already had COVID-19 because they may already be protected, and while the data is clear for vaccinating high-risk children … it is less clear vaccinating otherwise healthy children, whether there is any benefit, and there is no data showing that."" CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS RAIDED PRESCHOOL, INTERVIEWED 2-YEAR-OLDS OVER MASK POLICIES According to the Tampa Bay Times, more than 804,000 Florida children under 16 have contracted COVID-19, and 42 of those children died, for a death rate of 0.005 percent. The rate is likely lower, as countless cases go unreported. ""My honest opinion, otherwise healthy young kids who have recovered from COVID are unlikely to demonstrate significant benefit from the vaccine,"" Saphier told Fox News Digital. The vaccines have been highly effective throughout the pandemic in reducing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death, but they do not prevent getting or transmitting the virus. Children have been at a far lower risk of severe outcomes than older people from coronavirus throughout the pandemic, although their hospitalization rate hit  record highs  during the omicron variant surge in December and January.

Bishop says she has been made aware of a handful of comments teachers inadvertently made that ""didn’t sit well"" with students and their parents, such as a teacher singling out a young child whose parents decided to keep them wearing a mask and another who had made a student feel guilty about their decision not to wear one. She said the instances served as ""teachable moments"" to remind staff that ""a choice is a choice and that we need to honor that home’s choice."" ""There was a lot of angst, a lot of battles in the city over wearing masks, not wearing masks,"" Bishop said. ""So I’m glad that we’ve taken that fight away. All that has just subsided, and now we can go back to focus on learning."" Falling infection rates and new federal health guidance are leading most of the remaining states with statewide school mask requirements to drop the mandates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recently issued new guidelines  saying most Americans live in places where healthy people, including students, can safely take a break from wearing masks. But those hesitant about ending school mask mandates often point to low childhood vaccination rates among American children. Only about a quarter of children ages 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and about 58% of children ages 12 to 17 are inoculated, the CDC says. New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Delaware rescinded their statewide school mask requirements recently. New Jersey and Rhode Island dropped theirs officially Monday while California, Oregon, and Washington have  jointly announced they'll drop their statewide mandates  effective March 12. In many instances, the ultimate decisions are being made at the local school district level.

       Officials many large cities, such as Boston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., have said they'll keep mask rules for now, either until vaccination rates improve among their students, or they can work out agreements with teachers unions, which have been among those most vocal about keeping the mandates in place. After Chicago schools announced Monday that masks will no longer be required as of March 14, the city's teachers union vowed to take officials to court, saying the move will violate an agreement with the district to keep the mask rule through the end of the school year. In New York City, elementary student Jack Jalaly ditched his mask Monday as they became optional in the nation's largest school district. ""I think it’s nice because kids can finally see their teachers talk, and I also have a younger daughter who has spent all her time with no face, right?"" said Jack's mother, Andrea. ""So for little kids, it’s really great because you can see the way words are pronounced and you can see spellings. But third-grader Derrick Carter-Jacob kept his mask on as New York eliminated the requirement. ""I don't want to get COVID,"" he said. ""Leave it on. There’s no reason for him to take it off until basically everybody is safe,"" said his parent, Michael Jacob. ""I want my son to be safe. I’m sorry. That’s the way I see it."" John Bracey, a Latin teacher at Belmont High School in suburban Boston, says he intends to keep wearing his hospital-grade N-95 respirator through the end of the academic year even as district officials are expected to decide on their school mandate later this week. NYC PARENTS PLAN TO SUE THE MAYOR OVER MASK MANDATES FOR YOUNG KIDS The 41-year-old Bellingham resident said he and his wife have also decided to keep his two young school-age children wearing masks this week even though their district lifted the requirement Monday. ""I have major concerns on so many levels,"" Bracey said. ""It appears to be a decision made to benefit the most privileged and leaves everyone else to their own devices. We’re sacrificing the health of immunocompromised students, elderly staff, and those of us with young children. I just can’t find a public health or moral justification for removing them."" In Needham, another Boston suburb, school administrators waited until Monday — a full week after the state eased its mask requirement — in part to prepare students for the transition this week to what they call a ""mask-friendly environment,"" says School Superintendent Daniel Gutekanst. He said the work, which included posters and informational videos created by district officials, appears to have paid off, with no reports of major disputes or other issues around mask-wearing after classes ended Monday. Melissa Bello says her two school-age children were among those that gladly removed their masks Monday. She says her 8-year-old son has hearing loss in both ears and has been complaining of having trouble understanding people in school with everyone wearing masks the last two years. ""He’s working harder everyday in school and coming home more tired,"" Bello said. ""There’s not enough consideration for those kinds of tradeoffs in these mask mandates."" But Jason Chan, another parent in Needham, said his two school-age children went in Monday still wearing masks — and likely still will through the week before the family reassesses.

       He believes his children, which include a 5-year-old son who has never known schooling without a mask, would be fine wearing them until the end of the school year if it came down to it.

   In October 2017 – when most Americans never heard the word  coronavirus , and SARS was, if anything, a distant memory – the U.S.  government  was planning joint research projects with  China’s  Wuhan Institute of Virology.  That’s when Gray Handley, associate director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, forwarded the information to colleagues that said, ""China’s Interest in the Global Virome Project Presents an Opportunity for Global Health Cooperation.""

       (Liao Pan/China News Service via Getty Images) ""U.S.-China collaboration on the Global Virome Project is an opportunity to lead innovation in science, collaborate with China, and potentially contribute to scientific breakthroughs,"" said the summary of the Global Virome Project in the email that was part of  92 pages  obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit with the National Institutes of Health. The documents show that cooperation would include efforts in the coming years, such as U.S. government scientists providing training for Wuhan lab scientists in 2018. A key selling point was such a partnership would mean ""pandemic preparedness"" and ""enable rapid detection"" of viruses to prevent outbreaks. But by January 2020, U.S. health officials noted the Chinese government wasn’t being forthcoming about an outbreak, reluctant to say if it was related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  The 2019 novel coronavirus, better known as  COVID-19 , is also known as  SARS-CoV-2 .

An April 18, 2018, email from an official whose name is redacted, with the subject line ""Cable on Wuhan Institute of Virology visit,"" refers to a cable that says, ""China Virus Institute Welcomes More U.S. Cooperation on Global Health Security."" The cable later adds, ""China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, a global leader of virus research, is a key partner for the United States in protecting global health security."" This message notes that U.S. scientists were training Wuhan scientists in 2018. ""[E]xperts from the NIH-supported P4 lab at the University of Texas Medical Branch have trained Wuhan lab technicians in lab management and maintenance, institute officials said,"" the cable continues. ""NIH was a major funder, along with China’s National Science Foundation, of SARS research by the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s [redacted]."" The same cable further notes that a redacted word ""with the EcoHealth Alliance (a New York City-based NGO that is working with the University of California Davis to manage the [redacted], plans to visit Wuhan to meet with Shi [Zhengli].""  EcoHealth Alliance is a nonprofit that received about $600,000 in U.S. tax dollars. The organization spent money studying coronavirus in bats at the Wuhan lab between 2014 and 2019. The NIH  sent a letter  to EcoHealth Alliance in July 2020, asking about its relationship with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Shi Zhengli is described elsewhere in the documents obtained by Judicial Watch as a scientist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China country coordinator for the PREDICT project, which was a research project  funded  by the State Department’s U.S. Agency for International Development to fight disease. This project was described as a forerunner to the Global Virome Project. In December 2019, the first known cases of  COVID-19 emerged  in China and began to spread.

""It has ruled out SARS, MERS, and flu. [Redacted] confirmed it is a viral infection,"" Chen told his colleagues.

   Hong Kong  leader Carrie Lam said Wednesday that reducing the skyrocketing number of deaths in the latest  coronavirus  surge is the city’s priority, putting a plan to test the entire population on hold in the latest flip-flop in the government’s pandemic response. Lam said there is ""no specific time frame"" for a citywide testing, two weeks after she  announced  it would happen this month. Her earlier announcement, coupled with rumors of an accompanying lockdown of the city, left store shelves bare as residents stockpiled daily necessities. ""Now the situation is that planning and preparation are still underway, but it is not a priority to do (mass testing). When to do it will be a collective decision, and will take into account the opinions of experts,""  said  Lam.

   How has the  COVID-19  pandemic changed after two years? More countries are shifting toward a return to normal and learning to live with the  virus . Safe, effective vaccines have been developed and there's better understanding of how to treat people sickened by the virus. REPUBLICANS DEMAND TSA ALLOW COVID MASK MANDATE TO EXPIRE Two years after the pandemic began, questions remain about the coronavirus. But experts know a lot more about how to keep it under control. The virus mainly spreads through the air when an  infected  person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes. It's why  health  officials have encouraged the use of masks and ventilating spaces, instead of focusing on advice to wipe down surfaces as they did early on.

       (AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) Vaccination requirements for public school students, restaurant employees and health workers will be lifted. In the contiguous U.S., officials  announced  Monday that  Chicago  Public Schools will stop requiring face masks for staff and students beginning on March 14. ""CPS was one of the first to require universal masking in schools, and we would not be moving to a mask-optional model unless the data and our public health experts indicated that it is safe for our school communities,"" CEO Pedro Martinez said in a statement. The change applies inside school buildings, on school property and on school buses.  However, students and employees will still be encouraged to wear masks, and especially those in schools with lower vaccination rates.  MASK MANDATES GO AWAY IN SCHOOLS, BUT PARENT WORRIES PERSIST Martinez pointed to other large school districts’ decisions to stop requiring face masks in recent weeks.  On  Monday , masks became optional in  New York City  schools and restaurants and cultural attractions could stop asking patrons for proof of vaccination. Philadelphia is set to lift its mandate on  Wednesday , joining several other big cities.    Video But in Chicago, Martinez's s announcement drew immediate pushback from the Chicago Teachers Union, which plans to file an unfair labor practice charge with the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board.  ""Our city is fortunate that the numbers around the COVID-19 pandemic have shifted, with deaths, hospitalizations and positive cases low,"" the union said in a statement. ""But CPS buildings are congregate settings where vaccination rates also remain low, especially in schools with majority Black and Brown students on the South and West sides of the city.""  Meanwhile, in New York City, a group of parents  plans  to sue Mayor Eric Adams over his continuing mask mandates for children 4 and under in schools. Leaders have cited falling infection rates and new federal health guidance, but those hesitant about ending school mask mandates often point to low childhood vaccination rates among American children.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Only about a quarter of children ages 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC recently issued guidelines saying that most Americans live in areas where healthy people can remove their masks.

   The  World Health Organization  says it has issued guidance advising people on how to test themselves for the  coronavirus , months after critics said the lack of recommendations was compromising efforts to stop the pandemic in poor countries. CDC DIRECTOR EXPECTS COVID-19 TO BECOME A 'SEASONAL VIRUS' At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency was concerned that some countries are dramatically reducing their COVID-19 testing as the virus appears to recede in some parts of the world. According to WHO figures, COVID-19 cases and deaths have both fallen significantly in recent weeks.

       (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) ""Self-testing remains a vital tool in our fight against COVID as part of a comprehensive strategy,"" Tedros  said , adding that abandoning testing would cripple officials’ efforts to track the disease. Some activists have long decried the  lack of WHO guidance  for self-testing as a major obstacle for poor countries, noting that donors are unwilling to buy them in the absence of any WHO recommendations. While people in numerous rich countries have had easy access to rapid tests for months, the self-testing kits have rarely been available in poor countries, hampering attempts to slow the pandemic. HAWAII BECOMES LAST STATE TO LIFT MASK MANDATE, IDAHO ENDS COVID-19 DISASTER DECLARATION Numerous  health  officials have repeatedly pleaded with WHO to issue self-testing advice for that reason. Tedros said the new recommendation for self-testing would hopefully address the inequity in testing.   Video ""We hope that our new guidelines will also help to increase access to testing, which is too expensive for many low income countries where these tools could play an important role in expanding testing,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Unlike the massive effort to buy and distribute COVID-19  vaccines  fairly, there have been few efforts to scale up mass testing in poor countries. Even with the release of the WHO’s guidance this week, some experts estimate it could take until 2023 for self-testing kits to be widely available in the developing world.  "

   CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner mimicked many other media outlets in condemnation against  Florida  surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo on Wednesday. Appearing on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" Reiner took part in a discussion on Florida’s latest health guidance that recommended healthy children should not receive the  COVID-19  vaccine.

       (Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) ""In general, healthy children with no significant underlying health conditions under 16 years old are at little to no risk of severe illness complications from COVID-19. For adolescents 16 to 17 years of age, the risk of myocarditis due to the COVID-19 vaccines may outweigh the benefits,"" Florida's guidance read. Florida is the first state to make this recommendation while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has encouraged children ages 5 and up to be vaccinated. Because of this change in guidance, Reiner declared Ladapo to be a ""disgraceful surgeon general."" ""Florida has a disgraceful surgeon general,"" Reiner said. ""I think what has become abundantly clear is that children do get this virus. Most children thankfully will do fine with it, but the CDC says we’ve lost about 1,400 kids to coronavirus and thousands and thousands of children have been hospitalized. That can almost entirely be prevented by vaccination.""

""The surgeon general of Florida has been anti-mask, anti-vax. He’s been discredited by America’s frontline physicians. It’s an embarrassment,"" Reiner said. While Ladapo’s recommendation has been debated by doctors, media outlets have overwhelmingly attacked Ladapo for his positions regarding  vaccine  and  mask mandates .

   Everyone remembers the last activities they did before the world shut down in March 2020. Mine was attending my friend’s beautiful wedding in Aruba and hearing from family back home that all the activities around the Jewish holiday of Purim had been canceled.  I wasn’t shocked that the pandemic was hitting our shores. A month earlier, my brother-in-law who lives in  Asia  was sending pictures of the temperature check to get into his office building. ""We’re all going to get this thing,"" he told us. I had already  stocked up  on canned and paper goods. We got home from the wedding, pulled our kids from school and went straight into lockdown.  While we reminisce on the ""before times,"" it’s equally important to recall the beliefs that had been shattered by these two  COVID-19  years.  REPUBLICANS DEMAND TSA ALLOW COVID MASK MANDATE TO EXPIRE I was a small government conservative, sure, but I somehow still believed in our health agencies. The people were panicking, and buying toilet paper en-masse, but I was certain our health officials had spent decades preparing for a pandemic such as this. They would lead the way on sharing information between countries, carefully discarding information from totalitarian regimes like  China , and would prioritize returning us to normal as soon as possible.

             Image 3 of 3   Medical doctor giving injection to make antibody for coronavirus   (iStock) In retrospect, it’s crazy that I had such faith. I didn’t think I was naive but it turns out I was. I had generally counted on the government, certainly the federal government, to handle things poorly. I was raised on the Ronald Reagan quote ""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.'"" And still, I believed. This was important.

OZ SLAMS POLITICIANS WHO STILL FAVOR MASKS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN: ‘HARM WE’RE DOING COULD BE IRREPARABLE' From locking us all down to frequently providing conflicting information and lying that the ""science"" had ""changed,"" our  health agencies  were a complete disaster.  Again and again, they pushed failed mitigation policies that had actual harm on Americans. The leaders at the agencies, Dr. Rochelle Walensky at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health either straight-out bungled any task or comment or simply lied to us. This isn’t about the fog of the pandemic, the spring of 2020, this is to the present day.    Video As late as November 2021, Walensky was alleging that masking was at least 80% effective in stopping all viruses! ""Masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by reducing your chance of infection by more than 80%, whether it's an infection from the flu, from the coronavirus, or even just the common cold."" That would be miraculous if true. It is not true. There has not been a single study that showed masking to be an effective way of stopping COVID-19, let alone the common cold. And yet, right now, in New York City, toddlers are masked because of the broken and unscientific policies pushed by these organizations.  From locking us all down to frequently providing conflicting information and lying that the ""science"" had ""changed,"" our health agencies were a complete disaster.    HAWAII BECOMES LAST STATE TO LIFT MASK MANDATE, IDAHO ENDS COVID-19 DISASTER DECLARATION Fauci  would go on TV and be led along by the interviewer. In an April 2021 interview with Savannah Guthrie on the ""Today"" show, Guthrie  asked  about the recent loosening of masking guidance and why her child still had to mask according to guidance while she did not. She described a walk home from the bus stop where she unmasked but her child could not.  Fauci assured her that children would get vaccinated soon and would be able to unmask then. Just a few weeks earlier, Fauci said, ""The risk when you’re outdoors, which we have been saying all along, is extremely low."" But here’s the kicker: There was no new guidance exempting children from removing their masks outdoors. Guthrie had gotten it wrong and Fauci simply went along with it.      
      Dr. Anthony Fauci speaks during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Nov. 4, 2021.
       (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Both Fauci and  Walensky  would destroy the faith Americans like me had in our health agencies. They did not conduct themselves or the agencies to the benefit of us all, only to the benefit of their political allies.  Walensky let teachers union head Randi Weingarten craft actual policy that would keep kids out of school. Fauci would argue for  Biden’s  stimulus bill in order to open schools. Both were doing a political job while pretending to be nonpartisan. Their partisanship cost kids an education and for many kids far more than that.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It wasn’t just them, of course. As late as February 2022, Dr. Jerome Adams, who had been U.S. surgeon general at the start of the pandemic, was pushing the idea that masks worked because he alleged New Zealand, Singapore and China had masked their way to lower numbers.  New Zealand and Singapore are both in a serious spike right now, both  on  the CDC’s ""level 4"" that urges Americans to avoid travel to these countries, showing that masking could not work, while China is so obviously lying about their numbers.  Does Dr. Adams really believe the lies himself or is he lying to us? It is not meaningless that a medical professional at such a high level in America could hold beliefs like this. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It has cost faith in our systems.  Americans will never again simply follow what the health agencies tell them. Even for conservatives like me, that feels like a loss. We need agencies to tell us the truth in times of crisis. We need agencies that reach sane and rational conclusions and don’t foment hysteria. Those agencies are not what we have.   "

   The  World Health Organization (WHO)  says the global prevalence of  anxiety and depression  increased by 25% in the first year of the  COVID-19 pandemic . The scientific brief released by the  United Nations (UN)  agency said one explanation for the increase is unprecedented stress caused by the social isolation resulting from the pandemic.  WHO ISSUES COVID-19 TESTING GUIDANCE Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and loved ones, grief following bereavement, and financial worries were all cited as factors leading to anxiety and depression.  The WHO  noted  that exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking among health workers.  The brief includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, showing the pandemic has disproportionately impacted young people and women.  Additionally, people with pre-existing physical health conditions were more likely to develop symptoms of mental disorders. While those with pre-existing mental disorders do not appear to be disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, they are more likely to suffer hospitalization, severe illness and death compared to those without mental disorders. People with more severe mental disorders are particularly at risk. BIDEN LAUNCHES NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY Notably, the WHO wrote that the increase in the prevalence of mental health problems has coincided with severe disruptions to mental health services, and those for neurological and substance use conditions were the most disrupted among all services reported by WHO member states.  Many countries also reported major disruptions in life-saving services for mental health, including suicide prevention. ""The information we have now about the impact of COVID-19 on the world’s mental health is just the tip of the iceberg,"" WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""This is a wake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations’ mental health.""   Video The WHO said the most recent pulse survey on continuity of essential health services indicated that 90% of countries are working to provide mental health and psychosocial support to COVID-19 patients and responders.  The agency called for a global step up in the commitment to investing in mental health resources.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""While the pandemic has generated interest in and concern for mental health, it has also revealed historical under-investment in mental health services. Countries must act urgently to ensure that mental health support is available to all,"" Dévora Kestel, director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, said.

It probably doesn't matter because young children don't seem to have much of a problem with COVID, but they definitely are paying a price. And we have more data from yesterday again showing children developing more and more problems. They can't speak because they don't see the teacher's mouth move. They feel scared of each other. They've got masks that blind them from speaking with each other.

   The  COVID pandemic  contributed to a third of  young grade school students  missing reading benchmarks, which is up significantly from pre-pandemic rates, according to several studies. A recent  Virginia report  discussed data collected from The Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS) K-2 assessment, a tool used to evaluate students’ risk for reading difficulties that spanned three fall assessment periods in 132 school divisions. The study looked at rates of ""at-risk"" students K-2, pre-pandemic (2019) to the fall of 2021 when students returned to in- classroom learning.  The report found the number of first and second-grade students who scored below reading benchmarks in the fall of 2021 hit historic highs, at 36.5 percent and 42.2 percent, respectively. The report found in 2019 the percentage of students in the low-risk group for reading difficulties was 2.1 times greater than that of the high-risk group but by 2021, the percentage of both groups was nearly identical.

This number increased in 2021, when these two groups combined represented 65.5 percent of the population. The PALS data showed higher rates of below-benchmark scores among Black, Hispanic, those with disabilities and those considered economically disadvantaged.  ""We would expect to see the development of foundational literacy skills - phonology awareness, phoneme-grapheme correspondence (that's the relation letters have to sounds) impacted by the pandemic because they are typically established when children are so young and they would be very difficult to target remotely, especially for young children who would struggle to attend to and interact with a device the same way they would a teacher and peers,"" Gabriella Reynolds, PhD, CCC-SLP, a speech pathologist and assistant professor at LIU in New York, told  Fox News .  Reynolds, who works with individuals dealing with literacy and speech issues, told Fox News that remote learning during the pandemic possibly contributed to the recent reports. ""I have worked with phonological awareness intervention remotely and there was definitely a difference in attention between them and those who participated in the intervention in person.""

       TSA TO EXTEND COVID MASK MANDATE FOR ANOTHER MONTH Prior to the pandemic, reading levels were on the decline according to reports. Educators said the pandemic exacerbated the problem and steps need to be taken to help students ""catch up"" with reading and literacy skills. Nora Palma, a special education teacher in New York, told Fox News, ""The literacy gap right now has shown us that we cannot simply ""return to normal"" because we are dealing with issues that we have never seen before.""  Palma explained to Fox News that teachers are concerned over the reading deficiency reports and fear if they are not addressed at an early age, it could lead to increased dropout rates by the time the students reach high school age. ""We feel the pressure to catch kids up to grade-level standards but we are lacking the support and resources that our students need- especially when our data shows that many are 3-4 grade levels behind."" The special education teacher also said, ""Teacher burnout is a direct result of feeling like there is nothing you can do to ‘fix’ these gaps on your own but being expected to. Sadly it seems that students that can catch up will and those who can’t will likely fall even farther behind."" STATE PUSH BIDEN TO RESCIND HEAD START MASK MANDATE FOR CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 2 Palma said a potential solution is integrating explicit phonics-based literacy instruction, such as a program called  Fundations.   ""Fundations is an incredible program part of the Wilson Reading Program. I have witnessed illiterate adults learn to read with this program. There is data to support the fact that special ed referrals would drastically decrease if all students were offered a phonics-based reading program. Typically, after 3rd grade, the focus is shifted from ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn.’ Without foundational literacy skills students cannot access content- if you cannot access content, you can be compliant, but you cannot not engage in learning.

Laura Seinfeld, Dean of LIU Post College of Education, Information and Technology in New York, told Fox News, ""Teachers have always held a critical role in our society and I truly believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of teachers and their impact in meeting the academic, social, and emotional needs of all students.""

Carr also said, ""Public schools report they are struggling with a variety of staffing issues, including widespread vacancies, and a lack of prospective teachers. These issues are disrupting school operations.

TSA extended the mandate last summer until March 18 across all transportation networks in the United States, including airports, airplanes, buses and trains.

""As we prepare to shift into a new phase and learn to live with this virus, we have resources and tools that were not available two years ago,"" Burgum said in statement.

   FIRST ON FOX:  Congressional Republicans have whipped together a unified front in opposition to  President Biden's  ongoing federal mask mandates for students in the Head Start program. The letter, spearheaded by New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, demands the  White House  order the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to cease all mask mandates nationwide.  The letter cites the February decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to revise mask guidelines for indoor activities for the majority of the country due to declining rates of  COVID-19  infection.  Following the CDC's guidance, the ACF communicated to officials in Head Start – a free early childhood education program for low-income families – that they would no longer be evaluating mask mandate compliance. However, the messaging came without giving a clear end of the mandates, and many Head Start programs across the country continue to enforce the mask rule. ""Young children should never have been forced to wear masks, as they are at the least risk of serious complications from COVID-19 and could suffer the greatest developmental harm from having their faces covered,"" Stefanik's letter reads. ""Yet your administration’s authoritarian drive to impose mask and vaccine mandates on the American people included the issuing of a rule which requires universal masking in Head Start programs for all individuals aged 2 years and older.""

   First there were the sirens.  New Yorkers  are accustomed to darkness, even blackouts, but the silence pierced only by the wail of emergency vehicles was unheard of until two years ago this week when Gotham went into lockdown. Soon after, huge swaths of Americans, especially in our cities, were parked in their dwellings, facing a form of self-imposed isolation none had ever experienced.  In the beginning there was not only vast unity on the temporary and measured use of lockdowns, there was even a perverse kind of excitement to it. There were supplies to procure, remote work arrangements to be made, Zoom cocktail hours to organize and  schoolrooms  to fashion in our abodes. But soon both the unity and the novelty wore off, as a deep winter of lonely quietude fell upon America.  TSA TO EXTEND COVID MAS MANDATE FOR ANOTHER MONTH Today as we mark this anniversary the crisis feels like it is finally behind us, though thousands are still dying from or with  COVID , depending on how you count and who you ask.

China on Friday ordered a lockdown of the 9 million residents of the northeastern city of Changchun amid a new spike in COVID-19 cases in the area attributed to the highly contagious omicron variant.
       (Chinatopix via AP) The latest lockdowns, which also include Yucheng with 500,000 people in the eastern province of Shandong, show China is sticking to the draconian approach to the pandemic it has enforced for most of the past two years,  despite some earlier indications  that authorities would be implementing more targeted measures. China  reported  another 397 cases of local transmission nationwide on Friday, 98 of them in Jilin province that surrounds Changchun, a center of the country’s auto industry. In the entire province, cases have exceeded 1,100 since the latest outbreak first struck late last week. HONG KONG REPORTS RECORD COVID-19 CASES; MOVEMENTS COULD BE RESTRICTED Just two cases were reported within Changchun itself on Friday, bringing its total to 78 in recent days. Authorities have repeatedly pledged to lock down any community where one or more cases are found under China’s ""zero tolerance"" approach to the pandemic. Another 93 cases were confirmed in the nearby city of Jilin that bears the same name as the surrounding province. Authorities have already ordered a partial lockdown in the city and severed travel links with other cities.   Video Officials of the Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University have been sacked after a cluster of infections was reported on campus and students complained on social media that those who tested positive were being confined in school libraries and other buildings in poor conditions. The school has registered 74 confirmed cases and transferred more than 6,000 people to quarantine, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

   Health  officials have continued to monitor a hybrid  strain  of the delta and omicron  coronavirus  known as ""deltacron."" In a Wednesday media briefing, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the  World Health Organization's (WHO)  COVID-19 technical lead, said that there are currently ""very low levels"" of detection of the potential variant.  COVID-19: UK MONITORING HYBRID DELTA-OMICRON STRAIN CALLED 'DELTACRON' Deltacron has been reported in France, the Netherlands and Denmark and Reuters  reported  that researchers have identified 17 confirmed instances in both  Europe  and the U.S. ""We have not seen any change in the  epidemiology  with this recombinant. We haven't seen any change in severity. But, there are many studies that are underway,"" Van Kerhove told  reporters .  ""Unfortunately, we do expect to see recombinants because this is what viruses do, they change over time,"" she noted. ""We're seeing a very intense level of circulation. We are seeing this virus infect animals, with the possibility of infecting humans again. So again, the pandemic is far from over."" Van Kerkhove called for a renewed focus on reducing the spread of the COVID-19.  In January, when cases of deltacron were first reported, some labeled deltacron a  ""scariant,"" , with scientists expressing  skepticism  over its existence.  OMICRON, DELTA HAVE FUSED INTO NEW 'DELTACRON' STRAIN In February, health officials in the United Kingdom  officially  began to monitor deltacron after it was identified in a patient, according to the country's Health Security Agency.  Now, health experts say it's too soon for people to worry about it.    Video William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H.

   The following is a summary of some recent  studies  on  COVID-19 . They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. ""Deltacron"" with genes of delta and omicron found DELTACRON: A NEW VARIANT OF COVID-19 OR A LAB CONTAMINATION MISHAP? Hybrid versions of the coronavirus that combine genes from the delta and omicron variants - dubbed ""deltacron"" - have been identified in at least 17 patients in the United States and Europe, researchers said. Because there have been so few confirmed cases, it is too soon to know whether deltacron  infections  will be very transmissible or cause severe disease, said Philippe Colson of IHU Mediterranee Infection in Marseille,  France , lead author of a report posted on  Tuesday on medRxiv  ahead of peer review. His team described three patients in France infected with a version of SARS-CoV-2 that combines the spike protein from an omicron variant with the ""body"" of a delta variant. Another two unrelated deltacron infections have been identified in the United States, according to an unpublished report by genetics research company Helix that has been submitted to medRxiv and seen by Reuters. On  virus  research bulletin boards, other teams have reported an additional 12 deltacron infections in Europe since January - all with an omicron spike and a delta body.

       (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration) Genetic recombinations of human coronaviruses have been known to happen when two variants infect the same host cell. ""During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, two or more variants have co-circulated during same periods of time and in same geographical areas... This created opportunities for recombination between these two variants,"" said Colson, adding that his team has designed a PCR test that ""can quickly test positive samples for the presence of this... virus."" Dogs sniff out coronavirus with high accuracy New  research  adds to evidence that trained  dogs  could help screen crowds to identify people infected with the coronavirus. MASSACHUSETTS COUNTY FIRST TO USE COVID-SNIFFING DOGS At two community screening centers in Paris, 335 volunteers getting traditional PCR tests also provided sweat samples. Overall, 78 people with symptoms and 31 people without symptoms tested positive by PCR. Given the sweat samples to smell, the dogs were 97% accurate at detecting the infected patients, and 100% accurate at detecting infection in the asymptomatic patients, according to a report posted on  Tuesday on medRxiv  ahead of peer review. They also were 91% accurate at identifying volunteers who were not infected, and 94% accurate at ruling out the infection in people without symptoms. ""Canine testing is non-invasive and provides immediate and reliable results,"" the authors said. ""Further studies will be focused on direct sniffing by dogs to evaluate sniffer dogs for mass pre-test in airports, harbors, railways stations, cultural activities or sporting events."" Future variants-of-concern likely lurk in today's patients The many coronavirus particles inside an infected person likely include some mutated ones that may turn out to be early examples of important variants, new findings suggest.   Video Closely analyzing virus particles obtained from 10 people with infections attributed to the Alpha variant in Spain in April 2021, researchers identified some mutated particles resembling the omicron variant, which was not formally identified until seven months later. They also found mutations characteristic of a form of delta and Iota, according to a report published on  Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation . While identifying an individual patient's dominant variant may be sufficient for diagnostic purposes, the ""ultra deep"" genetic sequencing used in this study could help scientists track mutations in SARS-CoV-2 particles that might evolve into variants of concern, the researchers said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The virus that replicates in each infected patient is in reality a mixture of slightly different SARS-CoV-2 viruses,"" and these different viruses account for varying proportions of the full ""ensemble,"" said coauthor Celia Perales of Universidad Autonoma de Madrid.

Further, although BA.2 sequences are increasing in proportion relative to other omicron sublineages (BA.1 and BA.1.1), there is still a reported decline in overall cases globally,"" it wrote.  Studies are also evaluating the risk of reinfection with BA.2 compared to BA.1.  The WHO highlighted that, for patients in the United Kingdom, there was no difference in the risk of hospitalization from original omicron for those infected with BA.2.    Video Additionally, in a release, it noted that real-world data on clinical severity from South Africa, the United Kingdom and Denmark indicated there was ""no reported difference in severity"" for the variants of concern.

   The global  COVID-19  pandemic death toll might be around three times higher than official records, according to researchers.  In a study published Thursday in The Lancet, a group of authors wrote that the estimated number of excess deaths reached over 18 million, or more than three times the 5.94 million deaths the study says were reported for the same period.  EXCESS DEATHS IN US TOP 1M SINCE COVID-19 PANDEMIC START: REPORT They reached these conclusions with six models used to estimate expected mortality and all-cause mortality reports for 74 countries and territories and 266 subnational locations.  ""As mortality records are incomplete worldwide, we built a statistical model that predicted the excess mortality rate for locations and periods where all-cause mortality data were not available,"" the  authors   explained .  Excess mortality was estimated by comparing the total deaths reported from all causes with how many deaths would be expected given recent trends – excluding data from periods affected by late registration and anomalies. ""The highest COVID-19 excess mortality rates were observed in Andean Latin America, eastern Europe and central Europe, with high mortality rates in many high-income northern hemisphere countries and similarly high rates in nearly all of Latin America. Comparatively low excess mortality rates were seen in East Asia, Australia and high-income Asia Pacific. The April–August 2021 surge in south Asia brought cumulative excess mortality rates from the COVID-19 pandemic across that region up to or above the levels that were observed in some high-income countries,"" the researchers said. ""The cumulative global excess deaths from the pandemic makes COVID-19 potentially one of the leading global causes of death during the period of the pandemic, given the rates and trends in other causes of deaths before the pandemic."" US COVID-19 DEATH TOLL BREACHES 900K MARK Limitations to the study include that different modeling strategies were used, that the most recent weeks and months in 2021 were excluded from the assessment, that they estimated cumulative COVID-19 excess mortality rate, that empirical evidence that most of the excess mortality data is from COVID-19 is absent in most countries, that inclusion of other variables may have improved model predictions, that strict lockdown and mediation interventions can lead to negative excess mortality during the pandemic, that various drivers are responsible for the changes in all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population, that excess mortality estimates cannot be disaggregated by age or sex and lastly that they expect trends in excess mortality due to COVID-19 to change over time as the coverage of vaccination increases among populations and as new variants emerge. Understanding the true mortality impact of the pandemic, the authors wrote, is crucial for public health decision-making and future research and increased availability of cause of death data ""will be crucial for distinguishing the proportion of excess mortality that was directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection."" According to  Nature , the results are the first estimate of global excess deaths to appear in a peer-reviewed journal and the  World Health Organization's (WHO)  own analysis is set to be published later in March.   Video Study co-author Haidong Wang, a demographer and population-health expert at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), told the journal that more work is needed to separate deaths caused by COVID-19 from those that are the indirect results of the pandemic.  While some disputed the study's numbers, Wang highlighted that different models and techniques will produce different results.  For example, while this model uses 15 variables to estimate a country’s excess deaths, a model from  The Economist  that also reported ""very similar"" global excess mortality estimates had a model that uses more than 100 variables. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The authors spotlighted what they said are ""dramatic differences in the estimated excess mortality counts between the two studies for many countries.

DESANTIS ASKING STUDENTS TO TAKE OFF MASKS RESULTS IN MEDIA ‘MELTDOWNS’ DESPITE MASKLESS SOTU ADDRESS DR. MARTY MAKARY : The cloth masks did really nothing to reduce transmission. But what they did do is stunt child development, and people are seeing through it now. They're seeing the kids. They're not right, right? The kids are not growing up the way that kids in schools where they had no masks are growing up. And where's the study by the CDC of the kids who were in schools that were open the entire time with no masks and the opposite, the kids who had a lot of closures and then were wearing masks throughout? That is an easy study to do, but nobody in the government is interested in funding that study right now. It's pretty obvious what the results are and the results they don't want to know. … How hard would it be for public health officials to just say, you know, we got something really wrong? We thought the vaccine was going to prevent you from getting it or spreading it. We were wrong. What it really does is it downgrades the severity of illness if you get it. That's not a big confession that's hard to make. As doctors, we often tell people, look, the data has changed. But we're not hearing that, what you're seeing is sort of a digging in on their positions and they're alienating people. So now we've got people who are distrustful and they're saying, hey, you've also been ignoring therapeutics and other things. So right now you've got two entirely different perceptions of the same public health establishment. WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:   Video  "

   World Health Organization (WHO)  leaders on Thursday said that the world needs to remain vigilant about  COVID-19  – even as pandemic trends in some countries appear to be heading in a positive direction.  In a Q&A, Dr. Mike Ryan and Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove expressed concern over public perception of the pandemic as winding down.  COVID-19 PANDEMIC DEATH TOLL COULD BE 3 TIMES HIGHER THAN THOUGHT: STUDY In recent months,  health  leaders have eased or loosened restrictions and measures like mask-wearing or requiring proof of vaccination against the  virus .  Ryan, the executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said there are still scenarios where the world could ""reset"" the pandemic.  He said that is ""within our control"" – a choice towards a better future, instead of destiny. While normalization is something the agency wants to see, Ryan noted, what they ""don't want to see is a situation where we minimize the uncertainty we're facing."" ""Or, we minimize potential scenarios in which things can go wrong. We don't want people sitting up day and night worried about what's going to happen with SARS-CoV-2, or COVID,"" he stated.  And so, the world needs to maintain vigilance and ""keep pushing,"" Ryan added, because it's not through a phase where coronavirus could be regarded ""as any other virus.""  US COVID-19 DEATH TOLL BREACHES 900K MARK ""Any other virus isn't killing 52,000 people around the world at a low estimate and 10 million cases every week.

   Pacific Northwest  states are lifting their  mask mandates  on Saturday.  ""We’re turning a page in our fight against the COVID  virus ,""  Washington  Gov. Jay Inslee said during a recent news conference. MASKS ON PLANES, TRAINS: WHAT TO KNOW ""Two years ago today, we identified  Oregon’s  first case of COVID-19,"" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said in a statement. ""On the West Coast our communities and economies are linked. Together, as we continue to recover from the omicron surge, we will build resiliency and prepare for the next variant and the next pandemic."" In February, the governors  announced  that they would be lifting rules requiring masks in indoor public places and schools on March 12. However, other state and federal mask requirements are in effect, including those with health care settings and on public  transportation .

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is  extending  its COVID-19 mask mandate until April 18.  As COVID-19 cases have fallen around the U.S. following the winter surge of the omicron variant, state and local leaders have moved to ease or do away with pandemic regulations.  MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF AMERICANS CAN GO WITHOUT MASKS: CDC At the end of last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acted to  ease  its guidance on wearing masks indoors, including for schools.  The move shifted from looking at COVID-19 cases counts to a more comprehensive view about a community's risk from the virus.  According to a  map  that shows COVID-19 community levels by county, 98% of the U.S. population resides in areas where masks are not necessary indoors.   Video On Friday,  Michigan's  health department – which has  dropped  mask recommendations in schools and other indoor settings –  updated  guidance for how people should quarantine if exposed to COVID-19, including an altered emphasis on household contacts. The  guidance , which also applies to K-12 schools, says household contacts do not have to quarantine at home if they monitor for symptoms, wear a mask around others and avoid unmasked activities or activities with a higher risk of exposing vulnerable individuals over the course of 10 days.  They also should get tested at least once, three to seven days after exposure. Non-household contacts should also track symptoms, be tested if they develop them and consider wearing a mask around others. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition, Director Elizabeth Hertel  rescinded  an order requiring schools to report infections to the school community once notified by local health officials – though they must still report cases and outbreaks to county health departments and the state continues to recommend that schools notify students and staff of potential exposures.  The state also updated guidelines for child care facilities so they are consistent with schools and kept different standards for health care, long-term care, corrections and other high-risk settings in place.

   Puerto Rican  Catholic Bishop Daniel Fernández Torres was relieved of authority in his dioceses Wednesday, reportedly due to his pastoral opposition to  COVID-19  vaccination mandates. Torres, bishop of the Diocese of Arecibo, was officially relieved of his duties in an early Wednesday statement from the Vatican. The removal of a bishop against his will is an exceptionally rare scenario.  Many have pointed to the bishop's vocal opposition to vaccine mandates as a possible motive, though the issue remains murky behind the characteristic veil of Catholic politics. ""The Bishops of the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference (CEP) have received this morning an official communication from S.E.R. Bishop Ghaleb Bader, Apostolic Delegate for Puerto Rico of his Holiness, Pope Francis,"" the Puerto Rican bishops' conference wrote in a letter to the laity.

Archbishop Daniel, in this difficult moment of his life and mission as Bishop.' Similarly, we ask everyone to pray for our brother and the beloved Diocese of Arecibo,"" the bishops wrote.

Torres notably declined last year to sign onto a decree issued by the other Puerto Rican bishops advocating for the separation of  vaccinated  and unvaccinated parishioners during service. ""I was informed that I have not committed any crime, but that supposedly 'I was not obedient to the Pope, nor did I have been in sufficient communion with my brother bishops of Puerto Rico,'"" Torres claimed. ""It was suggested to me that if I presented my resignation to the diocese, that I would remain at the service of the church in case that at some point they would need me in another charge; an offer which, in fact, demonstrates my innocence."" However, Torres reportedly refused to resign, saying that he did not want to be complicit in what he saw as an ""unjust"" process.

   Makeshift shelters abut busy roadways, tent cities line sidewalks, tarps cover broken-down cars, and sleeping bags are tucked in storefront doorways. The reality of the homelessness crisis in Oregon’s largest city can’t be denied. ""I would be an idiot to sit here and tell you that things are better today than they were five years ago with regard to homelessness,"" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said recently. ""People in this city aren’t stupid. They can open their eyes."" As COVID-19 took root in the U.S., people on the street were largely left on their own — with many cities halting sweeps of homeless camps following guidance from federal health officials. The lack of remediation led to a situation that has spiraled out of control in many places, with frustrated residents calling for action as extreme forms of poverty play out on city streets.     
      In this aerial photo taken with a drone, tents housing people experiencing homelessness are set up on a vacant parking lot in Portland, Ore., Dec. 8, 2020. 
       (AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer, File) Wheeler has now used emergency powers to  ban camping  along certain roadways and says homelessness is the ""most important issue facing our community, bar none."" Increasingly in liberal cities across the country — where people living in tents in public spaces have long been tolerated — leaders are removing encampments and pushing other strict measures to address homelessness that would have been unheard of a few years ago. In Seattle, new Mayor Bruce Harrell ran on a  platform  that called for action on encampments, focusing on highly visible tent cities in his first few months in office. Across from City Hall, two blocks worth of tents and belongings were removed Wednesday. The clearing marked the end of a two and a half week standoff between the mayor and activists who occupied the camp, working in shifts to keep homeless people from being moved. BIDEN'S HOMELESSNESS CZAR WILL ONLY WORSEN NATION'S CRISIS In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser launched a  pilot program  over the summer to permanently clear several homeless camps. In December, the initiative faced a critical test as lawmakers voted on a bill that would ban clearings until April. It failed 5-7. In California, home to more than 160,000 homeless people, cities are reshaping how they address the crisis. The Los Angeles City Council used new laws to ban camping in  54 locations . LA mayoral candidate Joe Buscaino has introduced plans for a ballot measure that would prohibit people from sleeping outdoors in public spaces if they have turned down offers of shelter. San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared a  state of emergency  in December in the crime-heavy Tenderloin neighborhood, which has been ground zero for drug dealing, overdose deaths and homelessness. She said it’s time to get aggressive and  ""less tolerant of all the bull—- that has destroyed our city."" In Sacramento, voters may decide on multiple proposed homeless-related ballot measures in November, including prohibiting people from storing  ""hazardous waste,""  such as needles and feces, on public and private property, and requiring the city to create thousands of shelter beds. City officials in the area are feeling increasing pressure to break liberal conventions, including from a conservation group that is demanding that 750 people camping along a 23-mile (37-kilometer) natural corridor of the American River Parkway be removed from the area.

       (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Advocates for the homeless have denounced aggressive measures, saying the problem is being treated as a blight or a chance for cheap political gains instead of a humanitarian crisis. Donald H. Whitehead Jr., executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said at least 65 U.S. cities are criminalizing or sweeping encampments. ""Everywhere that there is a high population of homeless people, we started to see this as their response."" Portland’s homeless crisis has grown increasingly visible in recent years. During the area’s 2019  point-in-time count  — a yearly census of sorts — an estimated 4,015 people were experiencing homelessness, with half of them ""unsheltered"" or sleeping outside. Advocates say the numbers have likely significantly increased. Last month, Wheeler used his emergency powers to ban camping on the sides of ""high-crash"" roadways, which encompass about 8% of the total area of the city. The decision followed a report showing 19 of 27 pedestrians killed by cars in Portland last year were homeless. People in at least 10 encampments were given 72 hours to leave. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOMELESS COUNT TO BEGIN AFTER COVID-19 SHUTTERED LAST YEAR'S EVENT ""It’s been made very clear people are dying,"" Wheeler said. ""So I approach this from a sense of urgency."" Wheeler’s top adviser — Sam Adams, a former Portland mayor — has also outlined a  controversial plan  that would force up to 3,000 homeless people into massive temporary shelters staffed by Oregon National Guard members. Advocates say the move, which marks a major shift in tone and policy, would ultimately criminalize homelessness. ""I understand my suggestions are big ideas,"" Adams wrote. ""Our work so far, mine included, has … failed to produce the sought-after results."" Oregon’s Democratic governor rejected the idea. But  Adams says  if liberal cities don’t take drastic action, ballot measures that crack down on homelessness may emerge instead. That’s what happened in left-leaning Austin, Texas. Last year voters there reinstated a ban that penalizes those who camp downtown and near the University of Texas, in addition to making it a crime to ask for money in certain areas and times

       (AP Photo/Paula Bronstein, File) People who work with the homeless urge mayors to find long-term solutions — such as permanent housing and addressing root causes like addiction and affordability — instead of temporary ones they say will further traumatize and villainize a vulnerable population. The pandemic has added complications, with homeless-related complaints skyrocketing in places like Portland, where the number of campsites removed each week plummeted from  50 to five  after COVID-19 hit. The situation has affected businesses and events, with employers routinely asking officials to do more. Some are looking to move, while others already have. Oregon’s largest annual golf tournament, the LPGA Tour’s Portland Classic, relocated from Portland last year due to safety concerns related to a nearby homeless encampment. James Darwin ""Dar"" Crammond, director at the Oregon Water Science Center building downtown,  told the City Council  about his experience working in an area populated with encampments. Crammond said four years ago the biggest security concerns were vandalism and occasional car break-ins. Now employees often are confronted by ""unhinged"" people and forced to sidestep discarded needles, he said. PORTLAND CITY COUNCIL MEETING ERUPTS OVER HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT SAFETY RISKS: 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' TO BUSINESS Despite spending $300,000 on security and implementing a buddy system for workers to safely be outdoors, the division of the U.S. Geological Survey is looking to move. ""I don’t blame the campers. There are a few other options for housing. There’s a plague of meth and opiates and a world that offers them no hope and little assistance,"" Crammond said. ""In my view, where the blame squarely lies is with the City of Portland."" In New York City, where a homeless man is accused of  pushing a woman to her death  in front of a subway in January, Mayor Eric Adams  announced  a plan to start barring people from sleeping on trains or riding the same lines all night.

       (AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer, File) Adams has likened homelessness to a ""cancerous sore,"" lending to what advocates describe as a negative and inaccurate narrative that villainizes the population. ""Talk to someone on the street and literally just hear a little bit about their stories — I mean, honestly, homelessness can happen to any one of us,"" said Laura Recko, associate director of external communications for Central City Concern in Portland. And some question whether the tougher approach is legal, citing the 2018 federal court decision known as Martin v. City of Boise, Idaho, that said cities cannot make it illegal for people to sleep or rest outside without providing sufficient indoor alternatives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Whitehead, of the National Coalition for the Homeless, thought the landmark ruling would force elected officials to start developing long-term fixes and creating enough shelter beds for emergency needs. Instead, some areas are ignoring the decision or finding ways around it, he said. ""If cities become as creative about solutions as they are about criminalization, then we could end homelessness tomorrow,"" he said.  "

""You hope that, even with the delays we're seeing, the older children, some of the extreme emotional problems, that there will be a way through that,"" Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway told Fox News Digital. ""But, that's why it's really just horrific what we've put young people through, and all these … I think a lot of the people that are making the decisions are protected from it. They were wealthy enough, or cloistered enough that they didn't feel the ramifications. And particularly when we're talking about poor children who don't have resources at home, it just breaks my heart to think about what we put them through.""    Video Both Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the adverse effects of school closures could be felt for some time. A group of politically diverse parents  recently shared  their children's unfortunate stories on ""Face the Nation."" A dad who identified as a Democrat, for instance, said that the school closings resulted in a ""nasty mental health crisis.""  ""My middle child is going to college and they, at colleges, they really have a nasty mental health crisis – it's not made up,"" the father, Alejandro, said. School officials talked to parents in the district and determined that a return to in-person instruction in the fall was necessary, according to Stein's reporting. ""School system officials surveyed parents in July and determined that more than 60 percent said they were ‘very likely’ to return to in-person learning. Fewer than 10 percent of families said they were ‘very unlikely’ to return. More than 60 percent of teachers, who are not unionized, felt confident the school system could reopen schools safely; just 15 percent disagreed,"" the article read.

Homeschooling increased from 6.5% in May 2020 to 8.5% in May 2021 as many parents who were working from home full time struggled to keep up with their children's curriculum as well.  The Washington Post reported that the school district encouraged mask-wearing for kids under the age of 10, and required they wear them only in the hallways. They were permitted to take off their masks in the classroom.

   Comedy Central host Trevor Noah slammed New York City's conflicting coronavirus vaccine mandate standards that allow people to attend indoor events without requiring proof of vaccination, while  requiring proof of vaccination  for employees who go to work – including at those same indoor events. During a segment on Monday's ""The Daily Show,"" Noah mocked a recent instance in which the standards clashed at an NBA game between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. At the game, Nets star  Kyrie Irving  was only allowed to attend as a fan, not as a player or employee, because of his decision to remain unvaccinated.

Like for example, OK, right here in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has lifted the rule that you have to be vaccinated to attend indoor events. OK, that is gone. But there is still a rule that you have to be vaccinated to go to your workplace,"" Noah said.  ""So if someone’s job is at an indoor event, they can’t go to work. But they can show up to work to watch their colleagues do their thing. Yeah. Which is exactly what happened this weekend,"" he added, before playing a video clip of a news report on Irving buying a ticket to  watch his own team  play from the stands.  In the clip, Irving can be seen hugging his teammates, highlighting the contradictory nature of  vaccine  mandates that don't allow him to play the game but do allow him to be in the arena in close proximity to the vaccinated players. ""Yeah, guys, I don’t care like how COVID compliant you are, s**t like this makes zero sense. Can we agree on that?"" Noah said. ""So Kyrie can go inside, not wear a mask, even hug a teammate, but he cannot play!""

And, then, as a fan, what happens if he gets picked to take the half-court shot to win the car? Can he do that? What are those rules, how does it work?"" he joked. New York City  lifted its indoor vaccination requirement  on Mar. 7, along with mask mandates at indoor businesses and schools.  While discussing the rollbacks at a press conference earlier this month, Adams was asked by a reporter how it was fair that a tourist from another state would be allowed to go to whatever restaurant they wanted, while a firefighter or EMS worker who lost their job over the vaccine requirement wouldn't be getting their job back. ""The court of law said it’s fair … That’s the country we live in,"" Adams responded, noting that the rollbacks came from a court ruling.
