   most  americans  no longer need to wear masks in  schools  or public places, and senate republicans tuesday pushed for an end to one of the most far-reaching  covid-19  mask mandates left – transportation. ""i've got a crazy idea. the american people should have the same mask rules that members of congress had at the state of the union address,"" sen. ted cruz, r-texas, said. ""just two weeks ago, we saw 535 members of congress sitting on the floor of the house. i don't think there were five masks among them,"" cruz continued. ""joe biden didn't have a mask. kamala harris didn't have a mask. nancy pelosi didn't have a mask."" state and local governments lifted nearly all kinds of mask mandates in the past month as the winter omicron wave of the virus receded. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) also loosened its mask recommendations – a move some  republicans alleged  had more to do with the upcoming midterms than any change in the science.  rand paul to introduce amendment to remove ‘petty tyrant’ fauci from his position as niaid director but president biden last week nevertheless extended the federal transportation mask mandate. this affected americans riding in airplanes, commuter trains, and in buildings connected to such forms of transportation as train stations and airports.  cruz and a handful of other senate republicans attacked that extension tuesday as unnecessary and not supported by the science.  ""the current mandate was set to expire on march 18,"" sen. roger wicker, r-miss., said. ""we were satisfied with that… unfortunately for whatever reason, it certainly was not a scientific reason, the biden administration chose not to listen to the science and decided to extend the mask mandate for another month.""

2,10 biggest COVID mistakes – Americans deserve an apology from the medical experts,Dr. Marty Makary,2022-03-16 05:00:00,"  close     video   dr. makary: covid virus 'behaving less dangerous' than traditional flu   fox news medical contributor dr. marty makary says that a new report reveals that vaccinated immunity as well as natural immunity has reduced the mortality by about 90% and that omicron is now considered less virulent intrinsically than certain flu strains. new you can now listen to fox news articles!
   the medical establishment has  marched in lockstep on covid-19 , presenting a consensus of expertise as they marginalized physicians who had different opinions. two years into the pandemic, it’s fair to ask, how did public health officials do?  surface transmission   wash your hands like crazy (at least 20 seconds) and pour alcohol-based solutions on your grocery bags to stop covid transmission, you were told for months. despite being an expert,  dr. anthony fauci  immediately applied the influenza surface transmission model to covid. the logical starting hypothesis should have been that covid was aerosolized.      
      dr. anthony fauci, director of the niaid, participates in the white house covid-19 response team's regular call with the national governors association on the white house campus on dec. 27, 2021.
       (ap photo/carolyn kaster) there are only three coronaviruses that cause serious illness in humans:  sars, mers and covid . sars and mers spread by air. why did dr. fauci think covid was so different? the nih could have done the definitive experiment in one day to get the answer. it’s ok to be wrong in science, but not for months when the national institutes of health could have spent a fraction of its $42 billion budget to instantly establish how covid spreads.   no hospital visitation   the barbaric policy of banning loved ones from holding the hand of their dying loved one and saying goodbye was a human rights violation that spanned much of the pandemic. all the so-called experts and the medical establishment were complicit, allowing this cruel policy to be instituted while abandoning their duty to respect the dignity of human life. as a physician, i can assure you there are things worse than dying.  covid lockdown lessons learned – fauci amendment would mean no more health ‘dictator in chief’   video closing schools   the centers for disease control and prevention argued they were using science to close schools, but many private schools and most schools in florida and other states remained open throughout (with no difference covid outcomes). the cdc director initially said schools were safe but was swiftly corrected by the white house the following day. it later came out that the teachers’ unions had made edits to the draft school closure policy before it was issued (kids did not have a chance to make edits). now studies are revealing the catastrophic harm to a generation of children – significant motor and cognitive declines and a mental health crisis. in baltimore, many kids never logged on to virtual learning and were never seen in class again.    video ignoring natural immunity   ironically, when public health officials insisted that those who had natural immunity be fired for not being vaccinated, they fired those least likely to spread the infection in the workplace.  drs. fauci and rochelle walensky never talked about natural immunity and instead created the imprecise construct of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. in reality, most unvaccinated americans have antibodies that neutralized the virus, but they are antibodies that the government did not recognize. eventually the data came in. natural immunity was 2.8 times better in preventing hospitalization than vaccinated immunity and having both meant you had the same protection as natural immunity alone.  the singular focus on vaccines meant that little attention was paid to lifesaving therapeutics.   downplaying therapeutics   the singular focus on vaccines meant that little attention was paid to lifesaving therapeutics. for example, paxlovid is an antiviral medication that reduced covid deaths to zero in the clinical trial, yet not enough has been produced. fluvoxamine, an $10 anti-depressant medication that has been available for years, was found in two reputable studies to reduce covid death, up to 91% in the latest study (no study suggests it’s not effective). yet, few doctors are aware of these data because our public health officials have never talked about fluvoxamine.  not spacing out vaccine doses   spacing out vaccine doses makes a vaccine more effective and lowers the side effect profile. it also would have allowed the u.s. to save more lives when we were rationing a scarce vaccine supply. yet public health officials dismissed pleas to space out the doses as many of us called for.    video ironically, just three weeks ago, after 250 million americans received the vaccine, the cdc finally changed their guidance to recommend longer intervals between doses. the cdc acknowledged it was to reduce serious adverse effects such as myocarditis. myocarditis is now recognized to occur in 1 in 1,862 young males after the second vaccine dose.  cloth masks   the u.s. remains an international outlier by masking toddlers. at this point the only people in america still forced to wear masks are children, waiters, servers and staff. the nih could have funded researchers to properly study each mask type in the first 10 days of the pandemic, but they failed to pivot funding to do so. current data suggests that covering the faces of children for two years with a cloth mask had zero benefit and some harm.    video promising no vaccines mandates, then breaking it   this was a stated promise made by president biden, fauci and many others – a social contract. they then broke their promise insisting that any unvaccinated workers, regardless of their risk or natural immunity, be fired. they demanded that soldiers be dishonorably discharged and nurses be laid off in the middle of a staffing crisis.  click here to get the opinion newsletter this policy ignited a debate over civil liberties, which ultimately divided the country and hardened many toward the idea of vaccination. at the same time, the food and drug administration has been delinquent in authorizing the covaxin and novavax vaccines, which use traditional vaccine technology.    video downplaying a lab leak   a bombshell investigation by ""special report"" host bret baier of fox news revealed that prominent u.s. virologists told drs. fauci and francis collins of their concern that the virus may have been manipulated and originated in the lab, but then suddenly changed their tune in public comments days after meeting with the nih officials. the virologists were later awarded nearly $9 million from fauci’s agency.  boosters for young people   two top fda officials quit in protest because of political pressure to approve boosters in young people. the fda issued the authorization by not convening their vaccines and related biological products advisory committee – a highly unusual break from historic precedent.  a study in the new england journal of medicine found that the mortality risk of an un-boosted person under age 30 was zero. you can’t lower a risk of zero any further with a booster.    video click here to get the fox news app throughout the pandemic, all covid decisions were made by a small group of like-minded government doctors who often replaced the scientific method with medical dogma. they had tremendous influence over medical universities, scientific journals and medical societies. in fact, nearly all of these entities received funding from drs. fauci and collins and from big pharma. it’s no surprise, then, that with one united voice, the leaders of these organizations joined the groupthink bandwagon as the media parroted whatever they said.   at this point, the everyday americans who paid the price for the errors of the medical establishment can evaluate their performance.  this partial list of catastrophic errors begs for a complete overhaul of our health agencies. the american people, and children in particular, deserve an apology.  click here to read more from dr. marty makary

""i think the primary cause of this bout of pricing increases starts with covid. and the fact that we have supply chain kinks and that people rapidly shifted the demand curves so that demand for services went down and demand for goods went up. so those two forced prices up, that’s part one,"" warren said. she went on to explain how certain industries including the meat industry and grocery chains are fixing prices to expand their profits. ""what has also happened is that now that we’re living in america where there’s a lot more concentration in certain industries, look at the oil industry, look at the meat industry, look at groceries generally. what’s happened is that these companies have said ‘you know, we’ll pass along costs, but while we’re at it and everyone’s talking about rising costs let’s just add an extra big dollop of cost increases to expand our profits,’"" warren said. ""part one, yes, very much the pandemic. part two, companies that recognize that because they don’t face a lot of competition can goose those prices up,"" she told mathisen.

       (ap photo/lm otero) warren has frequently attacked major industries and corporate greed as the source behind increasing costs and inflation. in  november , she called for an investigation into the poultry industry for anti-competitive practices that could explain rising turkey costs. in december, she  accused  grocery store chains of exploiting the pandemic to raise prices and increase profit. indiana factory loses 7% of workforce in two weeks due to high gas prices: ‘too far to drive’   although various industries have cited supply-chain issues behind the higher costs,  president biden  and his administration have since adopted warren’s messaging and are now blaming oil companies for rising gas prices.     
      americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon.

   covid-19 virus  detected in wastewater sampling sites is on the rise, according centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) data. the trend comes as the country recently began lifting mask mandates and easing pandemic restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. of the 398 current wastewater sampling sites with active data, 44 sites saw an increase of 1000% or more in detection of sars-cov-2 rna wastewater levels and 62 sites saw a 100% to 999% percent increase, during the period of feb 26, 2022 – mar 12, 2022, according to the  cdc covid data tracker .

""we definitely are seeing an increase across our region, across our country, and indeed across the world, of the ba.2 omicron variant."" glatt who is also the chair of the department of medicine and a spokesperson for the infectious diseases society of america also told fox news, ""this probably explains the uptick of cases and the presence of higher values in the wastewater. whether it presages more cases and hospitalizations in the near future - we will find out in a week or two."" glatt also noted, ""we do believe that this strain is more contagious albeit it is not causing more severe illness."" omicron ba.2 sub-variant spreading in new york city the cdc confirmed tuesday, the increased detection of the coronavirus in sewage surveillance systems, after a recent report in  bloomberg  stated that more than a third of the cdc’s wastewater sample sites across the u.s. showed rising covid-19 trends during the time frame from march 1 to march 10.

   in recent times,  critical race theory  (crt) has come under increasing scrutiny. if there is a silver lining in  the covid-19 crisis  over the past two years, it's that  american parents  have seen firsthand, via their children's online classes, how public schools have pushed a radical agenda that includes crt (whether it's actually called that by schools or not). now, a new documentary ""whose children are they?"" reveals the issue in detail. ""whose children are they?: exposing the hidden agenda in america’s schools,"" shines a light on ""the need to return to the original intent of education, not indoctrination,"" as fathom events, the project’s distributor, points out on its website.

   this week marks the two-year anniversary of the  covid lockdowns . i join the american people in mourning the lives lost to this virus. i also mourn those we lost to the crushing and overbearing lockdowns and mandates that were based on junk science.  the toll of covid doesn’t stop there. we lost more than individuals. we lost our freedoms. our liberties. our vibrant small town main streets. our  children’s growth and learning . for two years our lives were held captive by petty tyrants and power-hungry bureaucrats.      
      dr. anthony fauci testifies before the senate health, education, labor, and pensions committee on nov. 4, 2021, in washington.
       (chip somodevilla/getty images) we’ve learned a lot over the past two years, but one lesson in particular is that no one person should be deemed "" dictator in chief ."" no one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of americans.   covid lockdowns may be ending, but we are forever changed to ensure that ineffective, unscientific lockdowns and mandates are never foisted on the american people ever again, i will introduce an amendment to eliminate dr. anthony fauci’s position as director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and divide his power into three separate new institutes.      video each of these three institutes will be led by a director who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate for a five-year term. this will create accountability and oversight into a taxpayer-funded position that has largely abused its power and has been responsible for many failures and misinformation during the covid-19 pandemic.   no one person should have the sole authority to dictate science, especially when that one person wasn’t ever following the science. i’ve said that from the beginning, and i’ve been proven right over, and over, and over again. on masks, lockdowns, schools, natural immunity, all of it.   why did we spend two years not following the science?    a rational person might ask, how in the world did it take us so long to get to the truth? why did we spend two years not following the science?  well again, that’s what happens when ""the science"" is dictated by one man, an unelected bureaucrat with far too much power.  the country is still reeling from the economic fallout of the lockdowns, which didn’t work. a group of researchers at johns hopkins university released a report confirming that. the report is an extensive analysis looking at dozens and dozens of studies, which comes to the conclusion that lockdowns did not reduce mortality but were devastating to the economy.     video perhaps the biggest victims of the lockdowns were our children.   all across the country, millions of kids haven’t experienced a normal school day since the beginning of 2020. whether it be virtual learning, having to wear masks all day, being separated by plexiglass, mandatory vaccinations, weekly or daily testing, canceled extracurricular activities, sports, and events, nothing is normal and it’s scarring our children.   according to the cdc, between march and october 2020, hospital emergency department volume for mental health visits for kids ages 12 to 17 increased 31% compared to the same period the year before. we also saw a 24% increase for ages 5 to 11 over the same time period.    video and it only got worse in 2021, in emergency rooms in 38 children’s hospitals across the united states, the number of suicide and self-injury cases in the first nine months of 2021 was 47% higher among children ages 5 to 8, and 182% higher among kids ages 9 to 12, all compared to 2016 data.   but it wasn’t just lockdowns that affected kids. it was also the notion that they must wear a mask for eight hours a day that also created psychological issues and inhibited communication between students and teachers.    keeping kids out of school clearly did far more harm than good. and the same can be said for masks.     video while the powers that be are just now starting to do away with mask mandates, we’ve known all along that cloth masks don’t work.   when dr. fauci said that cloth masks worked, i was truly concerned because that’s not what the science demonstrated. misinformation can cost lives if the government convinces 80-year-olds to wear useless cloth masks while taking care of spouses with covid.   dr. fauci caused people to engage in activities they wouldn’t have normally by telling them it was safe when masked when it wasn’t. i tried to sound the alarm, but i was censored by youtube and my videos were taken down. (""if dr. fauci says masks work, it must be true!"" the fake-news fact-checkers all screamed in unison.)    video dr. fauci and his friends worked diligently to silence opposing views. the media amplified his efforts. we were branded conspiracy theorists and anti-science for simply asking questions and presenting alternatives to what had been delivered to the american people as ""fact.""  click here to get the opinion newsletter i’ve been a physician for over 33 years. in all my years studying and practicing medicine, i had never encountered someone with the gall to proclaim himself ""the science"" and portray anyone opposing him as ""attacking science."" that is, until dr. fauci became the covid dictator-in-chief.  if fauci was simply one family doctor in peoria, his mistakes would not be so catastrophic. but since fauci is allowed to be a medical czar for the whole country, his errors are amplified throughout the land.      video when fauci misinforms the public that cloth masks work, he risks the health of anyone who believes a cloth mask will protect them when caring for a spouse or relative with covid.   click here to get the fox news app when fauci decides that he alone will define and fund dangerous ""gain-of-function"" research, his disregard for the possibility of a lab leak is felt worldwide.  the biggest lesson we have learned over the last two years is that no one person should have this much unchecked power. and my amendment, which will get a vote this week, will finally force accountability and fire dr. fauci.   click here for more from sen. rand paul  ",2022-03

   among the greatest lies of the  covid crisis , and it's a competitive category, high on the list was ""it’s not about politics."" in fact, with the exception of loss of life, there is nothing that was as deeply affected by the pandemic as our politics.   not only did governors exert unprecedented emergency powers, not only did covid dominate the  2020 presidential election , but it also fundamentally transformed how americans participate in politics.

       as we mark two years since the onset of covid, we need to think about what, if any elements, of our political life in the  midst of an emergency  we wish to make permanent features of american governance. nowhere is this need more keen than in regard to the vast powers granted to the leaders of our states, some of which still linger.  covid lockdowns may be ending, but we are forever changed with the stroke of a pen governors like new york’s andrew cuomo and california’s gavin newsome restricted the rights of their citizens to work, shop, go to church, go to school -- you name it they banned it. that precedent has now been set. should anything, be it climate change, or racism or ""misinformation,"" rise to the murky level of emergency, can these dictatorial powers be seized again?     video unfortunately, at the moment the answer appears to be yes. prior to 2020 we imagined emergency powers as temporary and targeted, a matter of weeks not years. that is simply no longer true. today, there is a pressing need for every state to codify in limited and strict ways how their governors can use this dangerous precedent in the future.   it has been rightly said by many that covid occurring in a presidential election year was the worst possible timing, and it is true. perverse incentives abounded on all sides to paint the pandemic in the colors of politics not public health. it exacerbated an existing trend in america of elections as existential crises.     video this is new. in 1996 nobody thought the outcome of bill clinton vs bob dole would seal the fate of america forever. now that kind of sentiment is a regular feature of our never-ending campaign season. we failed as a nation to come together on covid because we can’t come together on anything. there is no time anymore to govern, only time to plot out the next election.  and even elections themselves were not immune to covid. across the country states changed voting laws on the fly, often without the input of state legislatures, to keep people safe while voting. we saw enhanced early voting, mail-in ballots and drop boxes proliferate in the name of public health. today, democrats, who think these changes benefited them, are seeking to codify them going forward. even though this effort has failed nationally, in many states they will absolutely succeed.  click here to sign up for our opinion newsletter    arguably the covid precedent poised to do the most damage to our political system barely involves the government at all. rather, it is big tech and social media companies that took the opportunity of the pandemic to curate what political speech americans are allowed to be exposed to.    video just days before the 2020 election, social media banned an accurate new york post story about hunter biden. just days after the election, donald trump was barred from twitter.  click here to get the fox news app the skids that led to these illiberal developments were greased by covid hysteria. once social media companies decided that censoring covid information, even from scientists, was part of their duty to protect americans, it was a short jump to ""protecting"" us from ""dangerous"" political speech.  the long story short is that the short story is long. the significant upheavals in our political life brought on by just two years of covid will become permanent features if we do not quickly address and redress the excesses. the public health crisis is all but over, but the political crisis is only just beginning.   click here to read more by david marcus  ",2022-03

   one  connecticut  high school student is channeling his frustration and upset over the continued school mask mandates in his state into awareness, outreach and activism.  he wants others to know just how difficult the  enforced mask wearing  has been for students day in and day out, all through  the pandemic  — and why he thinks it should stop.  lucas johnson, 17, and other high school students in connecticut want their classrooms and school experiences to return to normal  now   across the constitution state. they know their state is in the process of dropping the mask mandate — according to gov. ned lamont, the mandate will end feb. 28 — but they don't want to wait a minute longer.  they also don't know what's over the horizon.  ""this is not just a fight for liberty,"" johnson told fox news digital this week in a phone interview. ""it’s a fight for our generation."" connecticut family shares ‘heartbreaking’ impact of mask mandates the students are concerned that local municipalities and communities will wind up extending the mask mandates — leaving students stuck behind masks well beyond february.  both johnson, a high school senior in danielson, connecticut, and his mom, patricia johnson, talked to fox news digital recently.     
      high school student lucas johnson, right, during a recent family vacation. he shared his concerns about the enforced masking of students in school with fox news digital this week — and says the fight over mask mandates is about ""a fight for our generation.""
       (patricia johnson) ""all our scientific data shows that kids are the least susceptible to covid but the most vulnerable to everything we’ve been doing,"" lucas johnson said, referring to the rising anxiety, depression, and other  mental health  issues that have come up over the past two years. ""i will continue to fight as hard as i can until kids are put back into a normal environment in school,"" he added. johnson founded the advocacy group, connecticut students for liberty. on wednesday, feb. 8, the group traveled to hartford, the state capital, and stood on the steps of the connecticut statehouse, speaking out about how mask mandates have affected their lives.  nj 3-year-old kicked out of speech therapy because of mask issues among johnson's comments that day, which caught the attention of some local outlets: ""the covid mitigation tactics in school, particularly the mask mandate, have been detrimental and harmful to the mental health of students,"" as connecticut insider noted of johnson.      
      lucas johnson, second from left, along with other family members during a recent vacation. his advocacy group for students helps other kids ""get involved and stand up for themselves,"" he told fox news digital.
       (patricia johnson) lucas johnson described to fox news digital his small advocacy group as 30-40 kids who are ""willing to do intense work"" for their freedoms.  ""it’s an outlet for kids,"" he also says of the group, ""to get involved and stand up for themselves."" their goal is holding connecticut state government accountable.  nj mom, forced to get vaccine before family wedding, winds up in er on a regular basis, the students peacefully protest, hold press conferences, conduct email and letter-writing campaigns, track legislation, and communicate through their dedicated facebook page. even though restrictions across connecticut might be relaxing soon, these concerned students are not. they want their state to ""drop the mandates immediately.""     
      lucas johnson (far left) along with members of his family — he's the oldest of seven, and the family has another child on the way. his mom described him as ""the leader of our pack."" 
       (patricia johnson) johnson is not just focused on the present. he's looking ahead to potential hazards around the state’s plan.  ""the governor requires the legislature to write the mandate into law for the time period between feb. 15th [when gov. lamont’s executive order expires] and feb. 28th,"" when authority is to be shifted to school administrators, lucas johnson told fox news digital. ""since they have no bill in front of them, we don’t know who will take up the authority regarding mask mandates after the executive order expires."" he fears this gap may open the door for the legislature to shift power to the connecticut department of public health and the connecticut department of education. ""we don’t want another mandate under a different name,"" he said. ‘hiding their emotions’  johnson said he and his peers feel ""disconnected from their teachers"" every day at school due to the masks they must wear. ""kids are traumatized,"" he said. masks, he said, make it easier for kids to ""hide their emotions.""      
      lucas johnson, a senior in high school in connecticut, told fox news digital he's troubled by the mask mandates and wants them to end now — and he hopes they don't re-emerge under a different name.
       (patricia johnson) the enforced mask wearing, in his view, has also created an unhealthy fear of covid  inside  the school — not something that's often reported.  ""you step out of school and there's no masks anywhere,"" lucas johnson said.  so ""school is a fearful environment now."" all of this and more is why johnson’s group organized a recent school walkout of 150 students who oppose the mask mandates. ""we've seen lucas work tirelessly to advocate for his peers and stand up for those who feel abandoned by the adults in their lives — namely the professionals in their schools.""   — patricia johnson, mom of lucas johnson, to fox news digital johnson also said he has issues with the covid mitigation tactics in school. he's had to quarantine four separate times due to contact tracing — and the stories he hears from other students and peers drive him to stay active and involved.  his mom, patricia johnson, by the way, stands firmly behind her son as he speaks up and out for his fellow students. ""we are very proud of our son lucas,"" she told fox news digital in an email.

   the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) said this week that third shots of  coronavirus   vaccines  significantly reduced the risk that people who are immunocompromised would be  hospitalized  due to covid-19. in a thursday study in the agency's morbidity and mortality weekly report, the agency said that – compared to hospitalized adults who had received two mrna vaccine doses – the effectiveness of the pfizer-biontech and mrna vaccines against hospitalization for patients with weak immune systems increased to 88%.  cases of 'stealth' omicron subvariant confirmed in northeast states: reports for  immunocompromised people  who had only had two doses, or a ""primary series,"" the vaccines were 69% effective.  the data was gathered  looking at nearly 3,000 – 1,385 case-patients and 1,567 non-covid-19 controls – at adults admitted to 21 hospitals across 18 states from aug. 19 through dec. 15 of last year. the agency noted the analysis start date was one week after the  food and drug administration (fda) authorized an additional dose for emergency use  for people aged 12 and older with immunocompromising conditions 28 days following their second dose. vaccine effectiveness was calculated for both groups by comparing the odds of previous vaccination between covid-19 case-patients and control patients who did not have the disease. the regression model was adjusted for admission date, region of hospital, age group, sex and self-reported race and ethnicity. separate models were generated for immunocompetent adults and adults with immunocompromising conditions and analyses were conducted using stata software. those who had covid-19-like illness received positive test results by a nucleic acid amplification test (naat) or antigen test and control patients received negative naat tests. patients or their proxies were interviewed regarding demographic and clinical characteristics and medical record searches were conducted. information regarding receipt of prior vaccine doses was obtained through self-report and review of source documentation.  three vaccination groups were considered including unvaccinated patients, two-dose mrna recipients and three-dose mrna recipients. three doses of the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccines were roughly 97% effective in preventing hospitalizations in those with stronger immune systems, compared with 82% of those with two doses. psaki: 'fully vaccinated' doesn't mean you're 'up-to-date' on vaccinations notably, the study was conducted when the delta variant was predominant in the u.s., whereas omicron now makes up nearly 100% of new cases nationally. limitations to these findings include that vaccine recipients in both dose groups were similar in terms of most demographic and clinical characteristics but may have varied with respect to exposure risk for infection, that vaccine effectiveness was not assessed against mild illness or infection, that vaccine effectiveness with a fourth mrna vaccine dose in immunocompromised individuals was not assessed and that most three-dose mrna vaccine recipients were vaccinated within several weeks of enrollment and durability of protection will require future analysis.  ""early evidence suggests that a third mrna vaccine dose elicits markedly stronger neutralizing antibody responses to the omicron variant compared with responses to two vaccine doses,  and increases [vaccine effectiveness] against severe disease following infection with the omicron variant,"" the cdc wrote. ""the effectiveness of three doses of covid-19 mrna vaccines against a range of disease severity associated with the omicron variant needs to be carefully evaluated in different populations.""   video in january, regulators said adults could receive boosters at least  five months  after their second dose. as omicron spread, the  white house has called on americans to get their booster  and the cdc said that administration of a third covid-19 mrna vaccine dose as part of a primary series among immunocompromised adults, or as a booster dose among immunocompetent adults, provides improved protection against covid-19 hospitalization. click here to get the fox news app among adults with and without immunocompromising conditions who were eligible to receive a third dose of an mrna vaccine, third doses were found to increase protection beyond that of a two-dose vaccination series for the prevention of covid-19 hospitalization.  according to the  american medical association , there are about seven million people with weakened immune systems in the country.

'stealth' omicron variant ba.2 circulating in almost half of us, but cdc exercises caution: report why does it happen? momentum is building around a few key theories. one is that the infection or remnants of the virus persist past the initial illness, triggering inflammation that leads to long covid. another is that latent viruses in the body, such as the epstein-barr virus that causes mononucleosis, are reactivated. a recent study in the journal cell pointed to epstein-barr in the blood as one of four possible risk factors, which also include pre-existing type 2 diabetes and the levels of coronavirus rna and certain antibodies in the blood. those findings must be confirmed with more research. a third theory is that autoimmune responses develop after acute covid-19. in a normal immune response, viral infections activate antibodies that fight invading virus proteins. but sometimes in the aftermath, antibodies remain revved up and mistakenly attack normal cells. that phenomenon is thought to play a role in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. justyna fert-bober and dr. susan cheng were among researchers at cedars-sinai medical center in  los angeles  who found that some people who have had covid-19, including cases without symptoms, have a variety of these elevated ""autoantibodies"" up to six months after recovering. some are the same ones found in people with autoimmune diseases. another possibility is that tiny clots play a role in long covid. many covid-19 patients develop elevated levels of inflammatory molecules that promote abnormal clotting. that can lead to blood clots throughout the body that can cause strokes, heart attacks and dangerous blockages in the legs and arms. in her lab at stellenbosch university in  south africa , scientist resia pretorius has found microclots in blood samples from patients with covid-19 and in those who later developed long covid. she also found elevated levels of proteins in blood plasma that prevented the normal breakdown of these clots. she believes that these clotting abnormalities persist in many patients after an initial coronavirus infection and that they reduce oxygen distribution to cells and tissue throughout the body, leading to most if not all symptoms that have been linked to long covid.   it can hit nearly anyone while there’s no firm list of symptoms that define the condition, the most common include fatigue, problems with memory and thinking, loss of taste and smell, shortness of breath, insomnia, anxiety and depression. some of these symptoms may first appear during an initial infection but linger or recur a month or more later. or new ones may develop, lasting for weeks, months or over a year. because so many of the symptoms occur with other illnesses, some scientists question whether the coronavirus is always the trigger. researchers hope their work will provide definitive answers. long covid affects adults of all ages as well as children. research shows it is more prevalent among those who were hospitalized, but also strikes a significant portion who weren’t. retired flight attendant jacki graham’s bout with covid-19 at the beginning of the pandemic wasn’t bad enough to put her in the hospital. but months later, she experienced breathlessness and a racing heart. she couldn’t taste or smell. her blood pressure shot up. in the fall of 2020, she became so fatigued that her morning yoga would send her back to bed. ""i’m an early riser, so i’d get up and push myself, but then i was done for the day,"" said graham, 64, of studio city, california. ""six months ago, i would have told you covid has ruined my life."" hogan, the new york nurse, also wasn’t hospitalized with covid-19 but has been debilitated since her diagnosis. her husband, a disabled veteran, and children ages 9, 13 and 15 fell ill soon after and were sick with fever, stomach pains and weakness for about a month. then all seemed to get a little better until new symptoms appeared. hogan's doctors think autoimmune abnormalities and a pre-existing connective tissue disorder that causes joint pain may have made her prone to developing the condition. if omicron increases global immunity, more manageable covid phase could be next: experts

   washington (ap) — when  president joe biden  met with u.s. governors at the white house on monday, he was the only one given a glass of water — lest anyone else remove their mask to take a drink. the president was seated more than 10 feet from everyone, including vice president kamala harris and members of his cabinet. a white house staffer who was wearing a surgical mask when biden entered the room was quickly handed an n95 version.

       (tom williams/cq-roll call, inc via getty images) it’s no surprise that unusual steps are taken to protect any president. but the strict precautions could also threaten to undercut the biden administration’s own efforts to tell americans — especially those who are  vaccinated and boosted  — that they can get on with something closer to their normal lives  in the face of the omicron wave. tucker carlson: biden's speeches reveal what he thinks of americans these are just some of the extraordinary efforts on the part of the white house to keep the president from getting  covid-19 , even though he’s gotten both of his regular vaccinations and his booster. and it’s emblematic of the messaging challenges surrounding the administration’s approach to covid-19 as the virus becomes endemic, familiar and somewhat controlled but still menacing, with hard-to-follow guidelines  often unevenly implemented . for months, biden aides have fretted that the people who are most protected against covid-19 remain the most cautious, a dynamic they view as a drag on the nation’s economic and psychological recovery. when the highly transmissible omicron variant hit, biden said it was a ""cause for concern, not cause for panic.""     
      president joe biden
       (ap photo/patrick semansky) in recent weeks, his aides and science advisers have highlighted study after study showing the strong protection offered by the covid vaccines against the variant and reassuring vaccinated people they can go about their daily lives. at a jan. 19 press conference, biden declared: ""we have the tools — vaccines, boosters, masks, tests, pills — to save lives and keep businesses and schools open"" and rejected the notion that still-widespread restrictions reflect a ""’new normal."" ""it will get better,"" he promised. since even before biden was elected, his aides have gone all-out to protect the now-79-year-old president from potential infection. he spent much of the 2020 campaign season holding remote events from a studio in the basement of his home, venturing out for travel in a bubble of frequently tested aides subject to an array of restrictions. that caution continued well after he was fully vaccinated and living at the white house. the president has held up his administration’s fidelity to centers for disease control and prevention guidelines as a virtue, after they were regularly flouted by former president donald trump, who became seriously ill after contracting the virus. as the nation’s virus response and vaccination campaign has become increasingly politicized, white house officials have expressed both political and policy concerns over a possible biden infection. though the vaccines are highly effective, a breakthrough case could erode public confidence in the shots and be used as a political cudgel against a president who was elected to bring an end to the pandemic. kamala harris crushed for non-answer about changing up covid strategy, draws comparisons to fictional buffoons biden himself has at times taken a more relaxed approach to restrictions. when the cdc last may surprised the white house by easing its guidelines on indoor mask-wearing by fully vaccinated individuals, biden sought to publicly model the policy for the rest of the nation. he was meeting with vaccinated republican lawmakers when the change was announced and led the group in removing their masks. but that cdc guidance proved to be premature and was reversed over the summer, because vaccinated people could still transmit the virus, potentially endangering the tens of millions of americans who are still unvaccinated.

       (ap photo/evan vucci) when the delta strain surged last fall, the white house strengthened its testing protocols for everyone close to biden — restrictions that had been lessened once aides were fully vaccinated and case counts began to fall nationally. in-person meetings were once again curtailed. aides began increasing the distance between biden and even vaccinated-and-tested individuals as a precaution, reminiscent of his earliest days in office. in early january, as the nation’s capital led the country in per capita covid-19 cases, white house press secretary jen psaki highlighted the ""very strict precautions"" taken to keep biden and harris safe, including mandatory mask-wearing and daily testing for those coming in contact with them. she also said the white house had taken to limiting gatherings ""to under 30 people."" but there were nearly 40 participants named by the administration — as well as two dozen members of the press — at biden’s monday meeting with the governors. scientists speak out on being silenced when raising concerns about coronavirus lab leak theory psaki said the administration takes extra precautions any time the president removes his mask to speak to a group. she noted that the nation continues to set records in reported cases and hospital admissions. ""the president’s view is that right now we still need to keep our heads down and stay at it to fight what is still surging in parts of the country,"" she said. ""but we do have the tools to get to a point where it does not disrupt our daily lives."" biden, aides say, has relished opportunities outside the white house when he can engage in the sort of political glad-handing that has been suppressed by the pandemic. and in public, he’s chafed at some of the precautions, saying that the first thing he aims to do differently in his second year in the white house is ""i’m going to get out of this place more often."" click here to get the fox news app he’s hardly alone in his impatience. on monday, seated across a large gap from biden in the east room, arkansas gov. asa hutchinson, the chair of the governors’ association, appealed for the government to more clearly define a pathway out of the pandemic. ""we need the cdc to help us to have the right standards to end this pandemic and move to more endemic status,"" he said. ""we want to go from today to more normal."" the night before, the president and first lady jill biden did attend the black-tie national governors association dinner at mount vernon. biden spoke, but he didn’t stay for dinner.

   speaking to fox news,  scientists  from the u.s., britain, germany, israel and australia have recounted that it was difficult to publish research about the possibility that the  covid-19 pandemic  began due to a lab leak, and that they found themselves shunned by other scientists, even when those scientists themselves found the lab-leak theory plausible. ""we got our heads shot from every direction, from people who we now know were actually thinking exactly the same thing, but have chosen to say the opposite,""  nikolai petrovsky , a professor of medicine at flinders university in australia, told fox news digital. chaffetz: fauci, feds tried to quash covid lab leak origin theory – protecting chinese interests over american lives the scientists speaking to fox news claimed that others in the field were desperate to protect the scientific community – and funding – so they coalesced around the single idea that a lab leak would have hurt their work, and the community. the scientists who supported the theory had research papers rejected, and the media branded them conspiracy theorists.

       (reuters/thomas peter) lord matt ridley, author of the book ""viral: the search for the origin of covid-19,"" told fox news that funding was also a motive for silence. ""senior scientists were quietly saying to me, 'we think you're right that it does need to be taken seriously, but we don't say so because the funding agencies might give us a hard time.'"" the  lab leak theory  has now become mainstream, but for a long time most outspoken scientists rejected it, including those at the very top. german physicist  roland wiesendanger  called this move a betrayal of science. ""if famous and top virologists are not sticking to the truth anymore, then we have no basis in science anymore to make progress,"" wiesendanger told fox news digital.  republicans investigating covid-19 origins slam biden administration's 'unsatisfactory responses' wiesendanger warned that scientists often believe they have a license to do whatever research they like, regardless of the risk – in the name of science. ""there were always scientists saying that scientists should be able to do anything, whatever is in their imagination,"" the german physicist said. ""they should be able to do this no matter what the concerns are from other scientists or the general public."" there was also a fear that if covid-19 was the result of this risky gain-of-function research, science itself would be harmed, the scientists explained. ""when they show that science could create something so malicious, this is a very big obstacle for the scientific community because it actually proves that science can do something that could be very violent and wrong,"" israeli biotechnologist  ronen shemesh  told fox news digital. shemesh and others said it is a major concern that little has changed – gain-of-function research continues, both in the u.s. and abroad. some say the research has actually picked up and there are growing calls for international regulations to monitor it. at the moment, regulations vary from country to country.  despite plenty of evidence that a lab leak was highly likely, even established medical journals refused to publish the scientists' work.

       petrovsky – who with the help of oracle-- used their super computers to map the virus, thereby showing that it likely came from a lab – said he received blanket rejections from editors at medical journals who called his work ""too hot to handle."" he was also told it would harm relations with china – a country that has such a huge influence over the medical community and research papers. ""there was a concern about offending china,"" petrovsky said. ""and obviously, there are a lot of links with china within science, and people didn't want to upset that relationship"" although the evidence grew, the mainstream media rejected them, too. lord ridley told fox news digital, ""you weren't allowed to discuss this possibility on facebook. wikipedia pretty well censored it. and the new york times and other outlets basically said that's a conspiracy theory that's been already debunked."" click here to get the fox news app as the silence continued through 2020, many said it all was political. ""they feared this might help former president donald trump,"" shemesh said. the scientists expressed hope, however. now that the idea of a lab leak has become more mainstream, that may spark investigations into the origins of the virus and, just as importantly, the way it was handled. there have already been numerous bipartisan calls for inquires.

   do you ever notice how almost all of the leaders of almost all the countries in the  western  world, particularly in the english-speaking western world, seem kind of the same? they're what we call neoliberal. they're all weak and fearful, if you think about it. and yet if you listen to them talk, you'd think they were omnipotent: 'we're going to reverse global climate change. we're going to vaccinate the world. we're going to end all human prejudice and replace it with equity. we're going to spread democracy to the untutored nations with guns, and they're going to love us for it. we can do all these things because we're all-powerful. we're like gods. you shall have no gods before us.'  now, mostly they're puny people. but when they speak, they sound like caesar standing in purple robes in the forum, commanding the known world.  joe biden  very often sounds like this, so does that squeaky little woman with weird teeth who runs new zealand. they all sound like this. they're unbelievably grandiose. it's by design. they'd rather talk about redeeming humanity than bother to fix your kid's  school  or replace the stop sign at the end of your block.  critics mock ‘puppet’ trudeau for fleeing capital during truckers protest: ‘tyrant on the run’  so you've got to wonder, why do they talk this way? and the answer, of course, is because they're terrified. they claim to be powerful because they know they're not. it's a bluff. it's a calculated pose. in fact, they know exactly how weak they are. they understand how little popular support they actually have, and they can feel their grasp slipping. and if you wonder if that's true, notice how they overreact to the slightest challenge to their power. remember a year ago when the qanon shaman skipped through  congress  on his mescaline trip, giggling and spreading good vibes? it was kind of amusing. but  democrats  in washington were panicked by it, so panicked they called in the  u.s. army  and sent that poor guy to prison. it's weird how touchy they get when you suggest they stole the presidential election, i wonder why?

       but this is not the behavior of secure leaders. this is how despots act when they fear they're about to be overthrown. and there's no more fearful despot in the world than  justin trudeau  of canada. over the span of just a few years, trudeau has turned a nation long famous for molson and sled dogs in niceness into a relentlessly punitive surveillance state. people have long whispered, in dead seriousness, that justin trudeau is the biological son of fidel castro. you could laugh it off, but now it's becoming pretty easy to believe. trudeau has used systematically  covid  to short circuit democracy in canada and to end organized  christianity  there.  canadians  can no longer travel freely within their own country. they can no longer return to their own country at certain parts. pastors have been imprisoned for holding church services. the unvaccinated can be sent to jail for buying certain products in stores. in the town of gatineau, family members were arrested for celebrating new year's eve in their own home. every large institution in canada pretends like all of this is perfectly normal, it's always been this way. canadian media, which are largely controlled by the government, support these policies and trudeau uncritically. in nova scotia, protests against justin trudeau's vaccine mandates are now banned by law.  canadian news host slammed for suggesting russia behind massive 'freedom' trucker protest rarely has a nation changed this quickly or more unequivocally for the worse. and last week, thousands of canadian truckers reached their limit. a convoy of truckers converged on the capital city of ottawa to demand, peacefully, cheerfully but persistently an end to justin trudeau's tyranny. justin trudeau's response to this display of democracy? he fled the city. trudeau evacuated his official residence and hid in an undisclosed location. he is still cowering there tonight. will he come back? has he abdicated? will canada be ruled by a junta of truckers? well, not at this point. he emerged by video conference from his lair to declare that canadian citizens who disagree with him are in fact attacking democracy.  trudeau:  there is a right to protest, there is a right to make your voices heard, loudly and clearly. there is not a right to shut down our democracy or our democratic processes, there is not a right to abuse, intimidate and harass your fellow citizens.   so expressing your views is an attack on democracy? and by the way, how dare you express your views as if you were free people. that's tyranny. democracy is when you obey like serfs. trudeau just effectively said that. and then because he has no self-awareness whatsoever, trudeau announced that he's contracted covid, which is perfect. in other words, take this shot or else, as you can see from the fact i am now sick, it works perfectly.  nova scotia outlaws support on highway for 'freedom' truckers days after massive protest if canada were in a country, it would be a remarkable dark comedy. so you may be wondering about these hordes of visigoths who's descended on ottawa, the ones who drove justin trudeau out of the city. what do they look like?  freedom, love, patriotic displays waving canadian flags. terrifying. but if you look closely at those pictures, you can see the real problem. these were working-class people. they're the guys who deliver your amazon boxes. and justin trudeau is repulsed by them. these people have stepped way outside their lanes. just leave the package on the porch and get the hell out of here. but they haven't gotten the hell out of there. they're still in ottawa, and justin trudeau won't meet with them because he never meets with people like this, not simply because they are blue-collar and dirty, though obviously they are, but because they disagree with him. as a reminder from justin trudeau, that's what democracy is. democracy is lecturing people who nod a lot in response. watch him explain.  trudeau: i have attended protests and rallies in the past when i agreed with the goals, when i supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues, black lives matter is an excellent example of that.

       so i'll meet with the people at a rally as long as i agree with their goals, as long as they agree with me, it's totally fine, like black lives matter. you get the sense even someone as dim as justin trudeau realizes this is not a winning argument. he needed his friends in state media to help. so they trotted out some attack lines against the truckers lines they borrowed directly from cnn and nbc news here in the states. so here's canada's state broadcaster inventing a claim, out of nothing, that vladimir putin himself may be responsible for this trucker convoy.  trudeau slams ‘freedom convoy’ for ‘hateful rhetoric,’ prefers to support blm protesters  cbc news: you know, given canada's support of ukraine in this current crisis with russia, i don't know if it's farfetched to ask, but there is concern that russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this, as this protest grows, but perhaps even instigating it from the outset.  russia . you've got to love canada. but let's be honest, they always steal our ideas and produce a slightly shoddy copy of them. we have wal-mart, they have canadian tire, not to be mean. russia, of course, putin did it. there's no evidence of that. no sources. they've just been reading american twitter. and the state media anchor is deeply concerned. who buys this? no one's going to buy this, it's so prima fascia absurd, so they just kept going. here's justin trudeau from his bunker offering yet another reason to distrust the hunta  running the newly formed nation of truckistan, formerly known as canada.  trudeau : we won't give in to those who fly racist flags. we won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans. canadian 'freedom' truckers massive vaccine mandate protest convoy may smash world record dishonor the memory, too many canadian flags. there are like three bad people in the crowd, so ignore them all, ladies and gentlemen. thankfully, by contrast, no one in any blm rally ever torched a courthouse or shot anybody or burned down a building. but these truckers, apparently, there was a racist flag. so pay no attention. now in the united states, we probably wouldn't fall for this at this late date. we're a little jaded at this point because we've seen it so many times. oh, they had a confederate flag, never mind, we can ignore their concerns. the election was totally fine. so again, we've seen it before. but in canada, they probably haven't seen it, they're a few years behind us. and so, you know, they're kind of impressed by it. claims like this happened here a few months ago, as you may remember, when democratic operatives carried around tiki torches to smear glenn youngkin as a white supremacist. again, trudeau had reason to think canadians hadn't seen that, and he might be able to get away with it. trudeau has been honing this line of argument for months now. last september, you may remember he accused people who opposed mandatory vaccination, getting a shot because the government requires it, of being racist.  trudeau:  but also, there are people who are fiercely opposed to vaccination. who don’t believe in science. who are often misogynist, often racist too.   poor canadians. they're good people. they don't have a lot of news sources. they've been exposed nonstop for two years to this kind of propaganda. if you don't believe in mandatory injection with an experimental medicine, you're a racist. apparently, some believe it, at least one counter-protester this weekend believed it.  washington post, msnbc trash canadian ‘freedom convoy’ truckers: ‘it’s a cult'  rebel news:  what did it say, sorry?  protester: so it says, 'f*** your white nationalist agenda.’ second protester :  i am not white; this has nothing to do with white. this is nothing to do with truckers. this is about freedom for all canadians. you can't be brown, black, white, whatever color you want to be. this is about freedom. trudeau no right to put us in this condition or indeed want the country to going to school. it's a terrible thing to do.   oh, thank god for rebel news. you think fox is an anomaly in the united states, how would you like to be rebel news? literally the only people in all of canada who are playing it straight. so there they are, trying to tell you that some guy from the subcontinent is a w=white nationalist. they're trying, they're trying hard. and now they have evidence, it's brought to you by cnn, naturally, working in tandem with the cbc. apparently, brace yourselves, there was a  trump  sign in the crowd of truckers.  cnn:  given the potential risk, jim, justin trudeau and his family, he has three kids, live about a mile from parliament hill. they have now been moved somewhere. we don't know where, it's an undisclosed location out of an abundance of caution. i will also say that former president trump certainly is supporting this group. i've been out there. i have seen trump supporter signs out there. and this leads to a larger question, jim. they're still in the downtown core. police just released a statement saying, look, we need the trucks to leave, we need people to leave, this city has to start functioning again, and the issue is how to leave. the people who have organized this say that they will stay out there months if needed.   jim acosta cnn:  all right. and we know you'll stay on top of it. alarming situation there in ottawa. … thank you very much.   ‘freedom convoy’ bans mainstream media from first press conference: ‘sabotage’ now we don't know who that woman is, but she should be completely ashamed of herself. she's a journalist, and yet she just told you that the ruling party of canada wants the people who are protesting their policies to leave. and then she nods gravely that they need to leave. things need to get back to normal. they've got to run the city doing all the important things that canadians do in ottawa. cnn is siding openly with the trudeau government, because you can't challenge power. i mean, that's what we do in the media is to remind you: obey, accept your fate, rich people have spoken, get in line. and we've got a trump flag to prove it.  but it gets worse. there were more racist flags this weekend. one of them imported conspicuously from this country. now we have definitive evidence of this. we're getting this from canadian media that there was a racist in the crowd.  twitter video (to a man holding a confederate flag):  but now he's going, now he's gone. we called him out. he knows he's going to hold his head in shame now.   oh, it's so great. you'll notice in the shot there's only one person who has his face completely covered. and he happens to be carrying a confederate flag. now the crowd looks at him and says, oh, wait a second, we know who you are, you're ray epps. oh, sorry, but we don't trust you. in exactly the way the crowd in washington the night before january 6th of last year said to ray epps, get out of here, fed.

       so the people on the scene didn't believe that guy was anything but a provocateur, and we don't know exactly who he was. we'll let you make your own conclusions from that. but we're supposed to believe that this one guy in the full face mask with a confederate flag proves the entire protest is racist. justin trudeau has every reason to run away like a terrified, wuss that he is, and we can ignore the concerns of the people in the trucker convoy. but we've got a couple of questions.  who exactly was that guy holding the flag and where is justin trudeau right now? it's not clear where he was broadcasting from this weekend, but what is clear is that unlike saddam or moammar gadhafi, we're never going to be able to find out.  now you think to yourself in a democracy, you should know what the head of state is, right? don't you have a right if you're a voter, shouldn't canadians have a right to know where he is? yeah, but it doesn't matter because justin trudeau can hide anywhere. he's a master of disguise. any place in the world justin trudeau could blend in, and you'd never know it was him.  click here to get the fox news app   and to prove it, we have a series of photographs. all of them are real, and all of them depict the canadian prime minister justin trudeau. you can see him looking very much not like a french canadian, looking pretty dark, actually. this is an arabian nights-themed gathering when he was a high school teacher. oh, he's got black face on. interesting. you can also see him blending in convincingly as a bollywood star in india. hands grasp together in reverence and prayer. or, you can see him flanked by his new countrymen, they have no idea they're in the presence of a canadian politician. that's how convincing justin trudeau is when he decides to play dress-up. they think he's one of them. i love samosas, justin says. we do, too, say the indians. they have no idea they're talking to a canadian. but when he's not fooling people in india, he's fooling native americans. and yes, there is a difference bigot. not all indians are the same. justin trudeau wore the traditional headdress of one of canada's many indigenous tribes, like the aztecs, justin trudeau will rip your heart out, ladies. and, is that clark kent of superman fame? no, once again, is just justin trudeau.  he can impersonate fictional characters. you can see him looking like a stranded pilot in the desert from one of the star wars movies. he could literally be hiding on a soundstage in hollywood as we speak. he can even be on a ranch. unbelievable. as long as no one hands him a gun or asked him where food comes from, that's a convincing rancher right there. so, yes, justin trudeau can change far more than his skin color. if you see that man in any of his various disguises, do not approach him. he might be hiding in a nondescript cabin in the middle of nowhere, but he's very much in control of ottawa, at least for the moment.

   truckers are a unique breed. there are very few jobs in modern western life quite so solitary as  driving a huge vehicle  across the mostly barren landscapes of north america. miles of road are coursed under heavy tires and light, thoughtful minds free to linger on their own devices. so the  anti-vaccine-mandate protest  initiated by these modern-day cowboys in canada is worth paying attention to. these are people who know a thing or two about freedom. in fact, they base their whole life around it.     
      protesters and supporters against a covid-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers cheer as a parade of trucks and vehicles pass through kakabeka falls outside of thunder bay, ontario, on wednesday, jan. 26, 2022.
       (david jackson/the canadian press via ap) what is most telling about the reaction to the protest is the disdain being shown to these truckers by their own government and many in the media.  prime minister justin trudeau  has dismissed the effort, and apparently gone into hiding as the big rigs surround the capital of ottawa. he claims that these men and women hold ""unacceptable views."" heaven forbid. critics mock ‘puppet’ trudeau for fleeing capital during truckers protest: ‘tyrant on the run’ you see, for politicians like trudeau and so many leftists in canada and the united states, it's not really covid they are worried about. it's the idea that some people, specifically people who work for a living and aren’t slaves to their handouts, have the audacity not only to disagree with them, but also to ignore them.   video pandemic restrictions and mandates galore are easy to impose on urban dwellers with office and service jobs. they can be and have been crushed with the flick of a governor’s pen. but denizens of the open road, without whom our modern miracle of an existence screeches to a hungry standstill, are not so easy to control.   video most of us in the influencer class, the politicians and pundits, leaders of business and those unsung heroes, hollywood celebrities, don’t think very much about how things actually get done. toilets flush, thanks to plumbers, houses are built, thanks to carpenters, and yes, store shelves are stocked (at least they used to be) thanks to truckers. the better sort of people, with their degrees and acceptable views don’t generally have to think much about any of this. click here to get the opinion newsletter but what the canadian truck protest shows is that this is a two-way highway. the truckers are just as free to ignore the elites as the elites are to ignore the truckers. the key difference being that the elites don’t produce much beyond noisy chatter.   video over the past week, it has been noticed that the very influencers and outlets who have spent two years lecturing in favor of lockdowns have come to a ""now it can be said"" moment. maybe kids shouldn’t be wearing masks at school, the new york times and the atlantic suddenly opine. perhaps there is nuance, we now hear from the buttery voices of npr.  part of this is because lockdowns have led to embarrassingly bad poll numbers for the favorite party of the elite, but there is something deeper. there is an emerging recognition that regular people, the ones who actually do things and make society function, are under no obligation to listen to the bleatings of the supposedly powerful. maybe freedom isn’t dead after all. click here to get the fox news app the time may be coming when robots push hogs across the vast stretches of our north america, when we no longer need the obstinate, caffeinated men and women counting mile markers with empty packs of cigarettes. but that time ain’t yet. for now, with the turn of a key, they can threaten those who seek to control them. it's a valuable lesson.  when those who choose to live a solitary existence, who wish power over no one but themselves, decide to speak out, it is worth listening. and if the politicians listen carefully they will learn something important. they work for the truckers. the truckers do not work for them. click here for more from david marcus  ",2022-02

      joe rogan, the popular podcast host on spotify, has emerged as public enemy no.1 among liberals.
       (photo by michael s. schwartz/getty images) rogan rose to fame years before spotify shelled out a reported $100 million to bring his podcast to the digital music streaming platform. he spent years as a successful standup comedian, had a mid-90s stint on nbc’s ""newsradio"" alongside the late phil hartman, hosted the reality tv hit ""fear factor"" and has been an ultimate fighting championship announcer for two decades.   he launched ""the joe rogan experience"" in 2010, and it quickly developed a following for its discussions about entertainment, current events, politics, comedy and just about everything else the namesake host found interesting.  by 2015, ""the joe rogan experience"" topped 11 million monthly downloads and the comedian-turned-actor-turned-ufc announcer-turned-reality tv host was suddenly more famous for his podcast than anything else. he says the success happened organically, and he never intended to conquer what is essentially modern talk radio.  ""it just sort of f-----g happened,"" he  said in 2016 .  four years later at the beginning of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in 2020, spotify announced it would bring ""the joe rogan experience"" exclusively to its platform. that same year, rogan declared he would ""probably vote for bernie"" sanders, the iconoclastic left-wing vermont u.s. senator running for the democratic presidential nomination. neil young's spotify boycott over joe rogan content backed by who director-general rogan’s quasi-endorsement of sanders resulted in backlash from the left, as liberal were irked that sanders touted his support. however, the liberals were not annoyed because of rogan’s politics, instead claiming he made ""racist, homophobic and transphobic comments"" throughout his career.  a cnn article reporting backlash to sanders’ campaign boasting about rogan’s support described the podcast star as ""a libertarian-leaning broadcaster,"" and cited past use of the n-word and his speaking out that transgender mma fighters shouldn’t be allowed to fight biological women as why he was considered problematic at the time.      
      liberal pundits have urged the streaming platform for take action against ""misinformation"" spread by joe rogan. 
       (youtube) ""the decision to highlight rogan's support has divided opinion among democrats and activists, particularly online, where it has sparked a heated debate over whether sanders should have aligned himself with rogan in any form or context,"" cnn reported at the time.  far-left group moveon even  asked sanders to apologize  for elevating rogan’s endorsement.  a mere two years after rogan first annoyed progressives simply by saying he’d vote for a self-described democratic socialist, the ""the joe rogan experience"" is seen as the face of covid ""misinformation"" by many outspoken lefties.  joe rogan torches cnn amid chris cuomo scandal: 'f---ing propagandists' whose 'ratings are dogs---' rogan has claimed he isn’t anti-vaccine, but has also suggested healthy young people simply don’t need it, which doesn’t sit well with many liberals. after backlash, rogan clarified on a later episode: ""i’m not a doctor, i’m a f--king moron, and i’m a cage-fighting commentator who’s a dirty stand-up comedian … i’m not a respected source of information — even for me."" however, that wasn’t the last time rogan found himself discussing covid on his show.  in june 2021, rogan’s guest, biologist bret weinstein, said ""ivermectin alone, if properly utilized, is capable of driving this pathogen to extinction."" months later, rogan announced he tested positive for covid himself and was using ivermectin to help combat the virus.  ""we immediately threw the kitchen sink at it. all kinds of meds,"" rogan explained in september. ""monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, z-pak, prednisone, everything. and i also got an anti-d drip and a vitamin drip."" the liberal media quickly began criticizing rogan, accusing him of pushing ivermectin on his loyal fan base. the drug was a hot topic at the time, as it is often used to treat animals. but rogan insisted three days of his ""kitchen sink"" strategy helped him recover quickly.  ""here we are on wednesday and i feel great,"" rogan explained at the time. ""i really only had one bad day. sunday sucked, but monday was better, tuesday felt better than monday and today, i feel good … i actually feel pretty f--king good."" rogan has also insisted people who have antibodies don’t always need the vaccine, is an outspoken critic of lockdowns and interviewed controversial dr. peter mccullough. last month, rogan suggested the risk of myocarditis among vaccinated people age 12-17 was higher than the risk of contracting covid, but was quickly fact-checked by australian broadcaster josh szeps. joy behar rejects joe rogan's apology following podcast criticism: 'i don't know that he can be reformed' as rogan spoke about covid more frequently, he transitioned from a comedian who made controversial comments on occasion to an influential podcast host who must be silenced in the eyes of many liberals. the daily beast enlisted a far-left advocate to declare rogan was ""mainstreaming right-wing information,"" and liberal musicians have pulled their music from spotify to protest his thoughts on covid treatment and rhetoric by recent guests.  ""the anti-speech activists in the media hate rogan because they fear him,"" krakauer said. ""because if an audience can be empowered to think for themselves by a media personality who refuses to tell people what to think, what do they need the mainstream press for?""     
      ""the joe rogan experience"" launched in 2010 and it quickly developed a passionate following. (photo by michael s. schwartz/getty images)
       (michael s. schwartz/getty images) last month, a group of advocates  signed an open letter  that asked spotify to ""take action against mass-misinformation events"" on its platform after rogan's ""highly controversial episode"" with dr. robert malone, which seemed to be the last straw for many of rogan’s staunch critics.  social media platforms reacted in panic after malone’s interview with rogan, in which he applied a theory from professor mattias desmet suggesting how a large population can be sent into ""mass formation psychosis.""  the video was swiftly removed from youtube, while malone believes google search results were also affected. the open letter blasted rogan for pushing ""misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine"" during the ongoing covid pandemic and noted that dr. malone has been suspended from twitter for spreading misinformation about covid.   former msnbc host keith olbermann last week called rogan the ""stupidest f-----g guy on the planet"" after he interviewed malone. cnn invited a health care professional who signed the letter to amplify it on the network’s struggling morning show ""new day,"" where co-host brianna keilar mocked rogan for ""moving the goalposts"" after he was fact-checked in real time by szeps.  rogan has since been criticized by everyone from  meghan markle  and  prince harry  to musicians neil young and joni mitchell, who pulled their music catalogs from spotify in an act of protest against his covid rhetoric.  ""while unsurprising, it's still amazing that someone like joe rogan has become the subject of such hatred and venom from the leftists media and their allies in academic and public medicine. rogan has drawn such strong levels of invective for simply going against the ruling class on issues such as covid-19 and, more broadly, the classically liberal principles of free, open, and rigorous debate with diversity in thought,"" newsbusters managing editor curtis houck told fox news.  ""despite having had a long career in hollywood and supported politicians like bernie sanders, none of his past behaviors are enough in the eyes of today's left. it's conform or be silenced. it's twisted and, quite frankly, lame brained for them to voice support for free speech and the first amendment but insist rogan shouldn't be allowed to have a prominent platform,"" houck continued. ""it's not only important to point out how he's not to be confused with a conservative, but it's almost an imperative to illustrate just how authoritarian and close-minded too many on the left have become."" cnn has particularly feuded with rogan; the two sides feuded when rogan took ivermectin to tread covid-19 and the liberal outlet ran the narrative that he had taken ""horse dewormer"" and a ""livestock drug."" rogan fired back in an interview with cnn's dr. sanjay gupta that his network was ""lying"" and gupta conceded some of cnn's people had misspoken. during a headline-making appearance on rogan’s podcast, gupta pointed to the ""snarky"" statement released by the fda saying, ""you are not a horse. you are not a cow,"" in order to encourage people to not take ivermectin, but rogan remained persistent on calling out cnn's coverage of a drug that's been ""given out to billions and billions of people"" and resulted in a nobel prize. rogan first told gupta that his ivermectin was ""prescribed to me by a doctor,"" forcing the cnn correspondent to say the drug ""shouldn't be called"" horse dewormer. the fight continued when cnn fumed in a statement to the washington post that rogan had undermined faith in effective vaccines, adding ""the only thing cnn did wrong here was bruise the ego of a popular podcaster who pushed dangerous conspiracy theories."" the post's erik wemple wrote at the time that the statement from cnn ""sounds more like the work of an advocacy group than a journalism outfit.""

   covid-19  patients may not need to wait long after being infected to know if they will develop post-acute covid-19 syndrome (pacs), also known as long covid, according to a paper published this week in  nature communications .  ""we want to be able to recognize and identify, as early as possible, who is at risk of developing long covid,"" said dr. onur boyman, a co-author of the  study  and researcher in the department of immunology at university hospital  zurich .  ""the most frequent symptoms of long covid are reported to be fatigue, dyspnea [shortness of breath], and cognitive impairment (also termed 'brain fog,' which includes loss of concentration and memory), as well as pain and aches at different sites (including headache), cough, change in smell or taste, and diarrhea,"" the study  said .      
      for some covid-19 patients, the symptoms persist.
       (istock) the syndrome has also been referenced as ""long-haul covid"" or ""post-covid syndrome"" for patients who have been infected with covid-19 but continue to experience long-term side effects and symptoms, according to the mayo  clinic .  ""estimates show that 10%–30% of people who become infected with covid-19 will end up coming down with long-haul covid,"" says dr. greg vanichkachorn, medical director of mayo clinic's covid activity rehabilitation  program .   the  world health organization  defines the syndrome as symptoms that persist for usually at least three months after a patient gets covid-19 without finding any alternative  diagnosis , but the centers for disease control and prevention defines it more generally under ""post-covid conditions"" that patients experience four or more weeks after being infected with  covid-19 .  ‘stealth’ omicron variant ba.2 circulating in almost half of us, but cdc exercises caution: report  the swiss researchers defined long covid for their study as the persistence of one or more covid-19 related symptoms for more than four weeks after the start of their first covid-19 related symptom.  the team evaluated the medical histories of 175 patients who were diagnosed with covid-19 and compared them to 40 healthy patients without covid-19 for the duration of the one-year study, finding 82.2% with severe infections had long covid versus 53.9% of patients with mild infections, using the world health organization classification for a mild or severe covid-19 infection.  the authors found patients who developed long covid had lower levels of igm and igg3 antibodies, which help fight infections in the bloodstream, throughout the disease compared to those with milder  infections .   the authors termed this antibody response an ""immunoglobulin signature,"" because unlike inflammatory markers that only transiently increase early in the course of the  disease , the detected antibodies are stable over time, which makes them attractive biomarkers.      
      the syndrome has also been referenced as ""long-haul covid"" or ""post-covid syndrome"" 
       ( istock) when they combined this ""signature"" with the participant’s age, past medical history of asthma and five particular symptoms during primary infection, the researchers were 75% effective in being able to predict the risk of long covid, regardless of when the patient’s blood was sampled.   cases of ‘stealth’ omicron subvariant confirmed in northeast states: reports nbc news digital reported, however, because the study was conducted between april 2020 and august 2021, a time before omicron was not known to be circulating, it is unclear if the findings apply to patients now, as over 99% all covid-19 cases in the united states are secondary to omicron, according to the centers for disease control and  prevention .  dr. claire steves, a senior clinical lecturer at king's college london, noted an additional limitation of the study was it did not take into account the participants’ vaccination status.  ""it would be important to look to see whether these markers are still predictive in vaccinated people as more of the world is  vaccinated  or has prior infection.""      
      the study authors found that the majority of the patients studied — about 75% — did not experience symptoms of covid-19 when they had a coronavirus infection. however, when the patients later developed mis-c, typically some two to five weeks later, fever was among the most common symptoms, the cdc analysis found. 
       (istock) she noted another key limitation was the study’s definition of long covid-19, which defined the syndrome as lingering symptoms for greater than four weeks, which contrasts with the international consensus to focus more on persistent symptoms lasting more than 12  weeks .  click here to get the fox news ""with cases high still, more people are at risk of developing long-term  symptoms .  we urgently need to scale up research on how to prevent this happening. tools such as these predictive models could be used to identify people at higher risk for enrollment into research trials for therapeutics,"" steves added.   ",2022-02

   fort lauderdale, fla. — the daughter of a former south florida mayor who recently ran for congress has been sentenced to prison for lying to obtain $300,000 in  covid-19 relief funds . damara holness on monday was ordered to report to federal prison by noon on april 25 to serve a 20-month sentence for the paycheck protection program fraud. the program was designed to keep businesses afloat during the pandemic. the judge on monday also sentenced holness, daughter of former broward county mayor dale holness, to five years of supervised release. she pleaded guilty in november, a day after a  democratic primary  for a u.s. house seat that her father ended up losing by five votes. ""the defendant saw this as an opportunity to unjustly enrich herself by defrauding the program designed to help those struggling businesses,"" assistant u.s. attorney jeffrey kaplan wrote in court records. damara holness’ lawyer, sue-ann robinson, said it ""was more an act of desperation than greed."" she said some of the money went toward ""housing arrangements"" and taxes. holness apologized to the community, the government and to her family, the  south florida sunsentinel  reported. she noted that she's affected her father's career. dale holness said his daughter has ""accepted responsibility for her mistake. we’re all human. she’s acknowledged it.""     according to court records, damara holness, 28, applied for the loan for her company, holness consulting. the application claimed that the company had an average monthly payroll $120,000 in 2019 for its 18 employees. the business was incorporated in november 2018 before becoming inactive. ""the defendant reinstated the business on june 22, 2020, in order to obtain the ppp loan. the business had no employees and virtually no income,"" the prosecutor wrote in court documents. prosecutors said holness spent months creating a paper trail after receiving the money.     
      
       (istock) court documents showed she paid 22 people, including a school bus driver and a security guard, about $1,300 every two weeks. once they cashed the checks, the ""employees"" kept $300 and returned the rest to holness. defense attorneys  urged the judge to give her a lenient sentence because she cooperated with investigators and she has a young child. prosecutors asked for a sentence between 33 and 41 months ""to promote respect for the law."" they also noted that holness committed the crimes while pregnant and was ""well aware that she was giving birth and that if she was caught that she could go to jail.""

   dr. eran bendavid, associate professor of medicine at stanford university, is making the case that continued masking and social distancing as measures to fight the  coronavirus pandemic  are actually doing long-term damage to our immune systems.  in a tuesday op-ed for the wall street journal, bendavid argued that the policies put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus needed to be re-evaluated because they were reducing people's exposure to microbes, therefore preventing the immune system from training well against other diseases. tucker carlson slams covid ‘nutcase from baylor’ peter hotez for ‘discrediting american medicine’ ""maintaining good health is often a balancing act. too much food and we develop obesity, diabetes and heart disease. too little food and we see stunting and wasting,"" bendavid wrote. ""this kind of equilibrium applies to our interactions with bacteria, viruses, parasites and other microbes. too much exposure to some microbes leads to disease, and so does too little."" ""the intensification of hygienic policies with the advent of covid-19 was understandable. but long-term masking, deep cleaning, distancing and isolation can be harmful to health, especially for children, precisely because it reduces exposure to microbes. hygiene practices have health risks as well as benefits,"" he added.  bendavid wrote that one of civilization's greatest accomplishments was the ""great escape"" from infectious disease, in that diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid fever, polio and smallpox were tamed by clean drinking water, vaccinations, antibiotics and sanitation. despite this, he noted, antiseptic populations were seeing increasing levels of asthma, allergies, type 1 diabetes, crohn’s disease and other diseases with a significant autoimmune component.

   in january, i asked  dr. anthony fauci  a pretty basic question: ""do you really think it’s appropriate to use your $420,000 salary to attack scientists that you disagree with?"" given dr. fauci’s theatrical outburst and deflection in response to my question, i think i hit a nerve. answering that question truthfully, which he is legally compelled to do when speaking before  congress , would have meant illuminating the deceitful game he and national institutes of health director francis collins have been playing about  covid ’s origins and their support of the type of dangerous research that could have led to the pandemic. fox news ‘special report’ outlines fresh questions on what fauci, government knew about covid origin how ironic that the frantic efforts by fauci and collins to label esteemed scientists as ""fringe"" and ""conspiracy theorists"" for daring to suggest that covid came from a lab was actually a sinister conspiracy of their own. they diligently worked with peter daszak, the president of ecohealth alliance – which was a recipient of nih funds to study bat coronaviruses and the potential risks to humans at a lab located in  china –  to discredit those who deign to question their conclusions. this triumvirate of gain-of-function research cheerleaders worked with their allies to, in the words of collins, ""take down"" scientists from harvard, oxford, and stanford for simply considering the merits of a lab leak theory.   video why such aggressive behavior toward their scientific colleagues? one reason is that their gain-of-function research, funded by your tax dollars, was at stake. dr. fauci has been a longtime supporter of this type of research. gain-of-function research is conducted by taking a known virus and conducting experiments to create new  viruses  that are not found in nature. our government’s bureaucrats brutally squashed any attempt to discover the truth of the origins of the virus   despite dr. fauci’s ducking and dodging when i’ve asked him about his funding of gain-of-function research in china, we have the receipts.  the agency dr. fauci heads, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), awarded a grant (project number 1r01ai110964-01) with a subcontract to the wuhan lab of virology, where researchers combined a gene from one sars-related coronavirus with the genetic information of another sars-related coronavirus and constructed new coronaviruses that infected human cells. that is gain-of-function, and plenty of scientists have called it as such.   video although the exact origin of sars-cov-2 remains unknown, its unique structure, specifically its furin cleavage site, which has not been found in natural coronaviruses, suggests it may have been developed through dangerous research of this kind. as former new york times science editor nicholas wade recently reported, at first, because of the furin cleavage site, ""the virologists had little doubt that the virus bore the fingerprints of manipulation."" rand paul continues pressing fauci for answers on nih gain-of-function funding and this wasn’t the first time our government had heard about something like a furin cleavage site inserted into a coronavirus. in 2018, the wuhan lab submitted a proposal to darpa to do just that, and the proposal was denied because of the danger of increasing human infectivity. to be clear, the virologists consulted in the early days of the pandemic immediately thought the lab leak theory was credible, and the lab where it could have come from happened to be a place where they performed dangerous (u.s. funded) gain-of-function research. that same lab had previously attempted to secure funding to create a virus with a very specific attribute – which was remarkably found in the novel coronavirus. that’s not a conspiracy, those are just facts. i do not know whether covid-19 originated in a lab. my point is that our government’s bureaucrats brutally squashed any attempt to discover the truth of the origins of the virus because doing so conflicted with their self-interests.   video while these virologists studying the virus made comments like, ""i just can’t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature…in the lab it would be easy to generate,"" and were struggling to explain the virus ""as an event outside the lab,"" we now know from recently released emails just how much fauci and collins were starting to panic. click here to get the opinion newsletter ""the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony,"" collins wrote in an email. so, of course, despite the experts giving credible reasons as to why the virus might be manipulated by humans, he and dr. fauci conspired to shut them down.   according to richard ebright, a molecular biologist at rutgers university, a teleconference on february 1, 2020 led by fauci and collins made clear to the virologists on the call that talking about the lab leak theory, even if based in credible science, was ""politically unacceptable and something that had to be blocked."" given the power that fauci and collins have to deny funding to these scientists, i’m not surprised the majority of them stayed silent. click here to get the fox news app what ensued in the following weeks was an all-out effort to discredit and silence anyone who dared to engage with the lab-leak theory. many of the emails have been released publicly, and i encourage you to read them. dr. fauci and dr. collins’ conspiracy to silence these scientists and bury the lab leak theory tells us one thing – they clearly prioritize dangerous gain-of-function research at a chinese lab and their own behinds over the health and safety of the american people. i’ll continue my efforts to hold fauci and his allies accountable. gain-of-function research is too dangerous. when  republicans  win the  senate , we will not only investigate the origins of the virus but also investigate whether or not we should be sending taxpayer dollars to do research that could have caused this pandemic. click here to read more from sen. rand paul    ",2022-02

   virginia   gov.  glenn youngkin has broad power to issue executive orders overturning mask mandates in  schools , lawyers from the state attorney general’s office argued wednesday, while lawyers for local school boards argued that the governor’s action usurps their authority. an arlington county judge heard arguments from both sides in a lawsuit the school boards filed against youngkin. she said she would issue a ruling soon. in the meantime, schools and parents are left with uncertainty. school boards across the state have refused to implement an executive order from the new  republican  governor that not only overturns a statewide mask mandate, but also bars local jurisdictions from imposing a mandate on students.

""it should not matter whose name is on the executive order,"" popps said. but john cafferky, a lawyer for alexandria public schools — one of seven school boards that jointly filed the lawsuit opposing youngkin’s order — said northam’s actions were justified because he was acting to preserve public health. youngkin’s order, on the other hand, endangers public health, he argued. he said youngkin is using powers designed to curtail public health crises to impose his personal philosophy that parents should decide whether their children wear masks. virginia faces new legal battles over masking in schools ""the personal-choice rationale comes at the expense of schoolwide protection,"" cafferky said. cafferky also cited a state law that requires schools to adhere to guidelines from the centers for  disease  control and prevention to the extent practicable, and said those guidelines recommend universal masking. popps, though, countered that no school board is able to adhere to every single cdc guideline. the cdc also has called for vaccinating all children age 5 and older, but no school board has seen fit to issue such a requirement, he said. click here to get the fox news app circuit court judge louise dimatteo took the arguments under advisement after wednesday’s hearing, but said she is cognizant of the need for a swift decision. both sides have asked for an injunction that would likely apply statewide, either barring implementation of youngkin’s order or requiring local school boards to implement it, depending on which way she rules. the lawsuit is one of several across the state related to the mask mandate and youngkin’s executive order. cases are also pending in loudoun county and in front of the virginia supreme court, but wednesday’s hearing was the first to go before a judge.

""i was actually pleasantly surprised,"" he said. ""i thought my commander was going to be completely opposed to the request, but when i saw on the paperwork that he actually recommended approval and then his boss also recommended approval – i mean, to me, it's not about me, it's a big navy thing. i think the commanders on the ground, many of them see this for what it is, but our hands are tied, and we have a lot of yes men at the top. it's really bad."" in addition to discussions with chaplains to determine whether they have a ""sincerely held belief,"" troops must meet with commanders and medical personnel, and then the final decision is made higher up the chain of command. the navy has not approved any of the thousands of requests for religious exemptions from the covid-19 vaccine. the rejection letter the chaplain received from vice admiral john b. nowell jr., provided to fox news digital, said, ""your request for religious accommodation through waiver of immunization requirements is disapproved."" ""a waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on your readiness and the readiness of the sailors who serve alongside you in both operational and non-operational (including training) environments,"" the letter stated, in part. ""i find that disapproval of your request for a waiver of immunization requirements is the least restrictive means available to preserve the department of defense’s compelling interest in military readiness, mission accomplishment and the health and safety of military service members. ""the navy is a specialized community governed by a discipline separate from that of the rest of society,"" the letter added. ""while every sailor is welcome to express a religion of choice or none at all, our greater mission sometimes requires reasonable restrictions. you have my sincere best wishes for your continued success in your navy career."" the chaplain said the letter of rejection was nearly identical to the other letters he’s seen. ""you can hold each of these up to the light, and they look exactly like everyone else,"" he said.  the chaplain pointed to the u.s. marine corps, which recently approved religious accommodations for three marines while rejecting thousands more. marines say they’re being ‘crushed’ over vaccine refusal: ‘a political purge’ one active-duty marine with a legal background  who recently spoke with fox news digital  said the corps granted those exemptions just to give the appearance that the religious rights of service members are being respected and to ""alleviate some of the pressure off of themselves."" that officer said, however, that the corps has not disclosed exactly why those marines’ requests were granted approval so that others can follow suit.

""that they're getting away with it just absolutely astounds me,"" the chaplain said. ""i would have thought that if you grant one, you have to grant everyone, because or else they are picking and choosing which religion is valid and who's constitutional rights under the first amendment will be honored and whose will not. it's offensive to me as someone who loves the constitution.""

""i honestly think that the push for 100% vaccination has to do with eliminating anything that looks like a control group,"" he said. ""i think that there's probably money involved somewhere. i think that the military has been a nice little test group, a set of test subjects that really can't say no."" the cdc has repeatedly said that the vaccines are safe for use, and studies have shown that unvaccinated covid patients are  far more likely to die  from the virus than vaccinated patients.

""that is kind of temporarily creating a very open situation."" u.s. hospitals are struggling with a shortage of nurses that worsened as  pandemic burnout  led many to retire or leave their jobs. meanwhile, coronavirus cases continue to rise and fall, placing tremendous pressure on the health care system. in california alone, there's an estimated gap of 40,000 nurses, or 14% of the workforce, according to a recent report by the  university of california , san francisco. hospitals are filling the gap by hiring traveling nurses, but that can be expensive. and hospital administrators say not enough nurses are graduating from u.s. schools each year to meet the demand. some hospitals have long brought nurses from the philippines,  jamaica  and other english-speaking countries, and more are now following suit. and both longtime recruiters and newcomers are trying to take advantage of the green card windfall before the fiscal year ends in september. the u.s. typically offers at least 140,000 green cards each year to people moving to the country permanently for certain professional jobs, including nursing. most are issued to people who are already living in the united states on temporary visas, though some go to workers overseas. this year, 280,000 of these green cards are available, and recruiters hope some of the extras can be snapped up by nurses seeking to work in pandemic-weary hospitals in the united states. the  biden administration , which has made moves to reverse  trump-era  policies restricting  legal immigration , has taken some steps to try to help foreign health care workers so they can assist with the pandemic. u.s. citizenship and immigration services said it would speed the renewal of work permits for health care workers, which could help keep some foreign citizens already in the united states on the job. the state department told consulates last year to prioritize applications for workers at facilities that are responding to the pandemic, an agency official said. nearly 23% of hospitals report 'critical staffing shortage' amid record covid-19 cases

""at this point and time, i just feel like i have faith that at the end of march something is going to show up to continue to work,"" akinmade said. she said the issue affects many of her international colleagues as well as domestic ones, who may be pressed to take on shifts for colleagues if their immigration paperwork doesn’t come through. dr. roxie wells, president of cape fear valley hoke hospital in  raeford, north carolina , said she started trying to bring over foreign nurses before the pandemic, but it wasn't until last year that these recruits started getting consular interviews in larger numbers. so far, about 150 were approved to come work, but wells said they're still waiting on another 75. ""obviously it has become more necessary during the pandemic,"" she said. ""the 150, if we didn’t have them, we would be in a precarious situation."" the surge in the omicron variant in the united states has made the strained staffing situation even more apparent in  hospitals  as health care workers, like so many others, have been sickened by the highly contagious virus and sidelined from work at a time when more patients are coming in. sinead carbery, president of nurse staffing solutions for amn healthcare, said the demand for international nurses has risen between 300% and 400% since the pandemic began. the number of nurses that can be brought into the united states even with the additional green cards won't be enough to meet demand, and many more recruiters are now seeking to hire nurses overseas because there are immigrant visas available, she said. ""this is a window of opportunity,"" she said. ""because everything is flowing so well, there's a lot of competition for that talent."" hospitals across the us turning to foreign nurses as healthcare workers are fired over vaccine mandates national nurses united, a union representing 175,000 registered nurses, said more scrutiny should be given to international recruitment to ensure foreign nurses aren't brought in and subjected to unsafe working conditions. the union contends hospitals drove away u.s. nurses by keeping staffing levels so low — and this was well before concerns arose about worker safety and protections during the covid-19 pandemic. michelle mahon, the union's assistant director of nursing practice, said many foreign nurses sign yearslong contracts with employers, which can make it hard for them to speak up about labor or patient safety concerns. she said hospitals that saw nurses quit during the pandemic are turning to an overseas workforce to replace them. ""this kind of dynamic is particularly attractive right now to employers who have not made any of the changes necessary to ensure patient and nursing safety during this covid-19 pandemic,"" mahon said. ""instead of them addressing the actual problem, they want to go and pivot to this other really fake solution."" hospital administrators, however, contend there simply aren’t enough u.s.-trained nurses to go around. patty jeffrey, president of the american association of international healthcare recruitment, said the united states should expand nursing education programs to train more nurses domestically, as well as let more nurses come in from overseas. but she acknowledged bringing in a much larger number of nurses would require legislation. ""the calls are every day ringing off the hook: we need 100, we need 200, we need all these nurses,"" jeffrey said. jorge almeida neri, a 26-year-old nurse  from portugal , arrived in the united states late last year, though he began the process before the pandemic. he said a required international nursing exam was delayed due to the virus and it took four months to get a consular interview, though other international nurses he's met waited much longer. he interviewed for his current job at a virginia hospital, which he got through a staffing agency, about a year ago. ""after getting everything certified, the immigration process started, and i was like, ‘oh, this is going to be quick.’ i was wrong,"" he said. almeida neri said many portuguese nurses seek work overseas since wages are low, though many go elsewhere in europe, which doesn't take as long as the united states. despite the demand, there's no guarantee hospitals will in fact snap up more visas. greg siskind, an immigration attorney, said u.s. consular offices aren't required to issue visas solely because they're available, and are hampered by limits on remote work and video interviews. he said most employment-based green cards tend to go to professionals already in the united states, not overseas, though more could be done to speed these up, too. click here to get the fox news ""under their current policies, if they don't make any changes, it is going to be hard,"" he said of the likelihood the u.s. government will issue all the available visas, ""but there's a lot of things they could do.""

   you may remember that glenn youngkin became governor of  virginia  last month. youngkin was elected in part because he promised to let parents decide whether or not their kids wear masks in school. voters wanted that. so true to his word, almost immediately after he was sworn in, youngkin banned mask mandates in school. no one was surprised by this, obviously. again, he ran on it. that's how democracy is supposed to work. voters want something, they asked for it, then they elect someone to do it, and then that person does it.  so in virginia, our system functioned perfectly, our democratic system. but there are still people in the state of virginia who don't believe in democracy, and they're not qanon people, by the way, they're members of the  democratic party . they have no interest in what voters think, they have contempt for election results. they do what they want. and it turns out a lot of these people are now running the public  schools  in virginia. and, because they don't care about the law or election outcomes, they've refused to lift the mask mandates for children. so gov. youngkin pushed back against this, of course, and the standoff wound up in court.  yesterday, the judge in that case, louise dimatteo, made a highly revealing statement: ""i'm not going to decide who's right and who's wrong on masking,"" she said. ""this is really about the hierarchy of authority."" well, exactly. that really is what it's about. after more than two years of  covid  restrictions, there's not a huge amount of scientific debate over masks on children. masks don't appear to work. they don't appear to protect children. we do know they hurt children profoundly.  va circuit judge on schools mask mandate: ‘it’s about the hierarchy of authority'  so at this point, the only debate left, as the judge pointed out, is not to debate over science. it's a debate about power. and here are the parameters: who's in charge of your children? is it you, the parent, or is it the teachers' unions? who runs your country? is it you, the voters, or is it unelected bureaucrats? are they really in charge? so, to be clear, this isn't really about masks. those are the questions we're debating at this point.

       janet davidson has already made up her mind about these questions. davidson is an assistant principal at an elementary school in loudoun county, virginia. here, she threatens to have children arrested if they dare to show up to class without a mask. davidson:   until you arrive your children will be held in an in-school restriction situation here at school. it is important that i point out to you it is stated in the letter that you'll receive -- but, it's important that i point out to you that they are not allowed on campus or on loudoun county public school property. starting tomorrow, it will be considered trespassing. so it's important that i make that statement to you. but we'll look forward to hearing from you via phone so you can let us know so you can let us know when you'll be able to pick them up. so you have to ask, how could someone like that wind up running an elementary school? wouldn't that be the last person you'd want to hand your kids over to every morning? well, sure. and to be clear, trespassing, the crime that she cites, is in virginia class 1 misdemeanor. if you trespass, you can get a year in prison and a $2,500 fine. and that's exactly what she is threatening kids with if they show up without masks at school. so in loudoun county, you can sexually assault someone in a bathroom, the school will cover for you. but if you show up without a mask, you face a year in jail.    video and it's not just virginia, by the way, this is happening all over the country, according to a service that tracks mask policies and school districts across america. more than 60% of the 500 districts it monitors still require masks.  virginia faces new legal battles over masking in schools in west islip,  new york , for example, the oquenock elementary school sent letters to parents recently explaining their children will be considered truant if they dare to show up to school without a mask. now in the state of new york, the parents of truant students can receive fines and prison terms. this show obtained a letter from oquenock, the elementary school, to the parents of a very young child enrolled there. ""for the last week, your child has arrived at school but refused to wear a mask, and therefore has not been permitted to attend class or participate in other school activities,"" reads the letter. ""your child will no longer be able to attend school unless they wear a mask...if your child does not return to school, they will be considered truant.""  oh, so the child is punished either way. what you notice is that nowhere in the letter is there any  scientific  justification for these rules because, of course, there isn't one, it doesn't exist. there is a consensus now among serious people that mask mandates for children do not protect children or adults. and to be clear, that's not a right-wing opinion. the atlantic magazine, whose default setting for two full years has been screaming covid hysteria, just published a piece entitled ""the case against masks at school."" the piece notes mask ""provide little discernible benefit,"" and it's not just the atlantic. today, a team of scientists and virologists published an op-ed in usa today. their conclusion? ""with vaccines available mask mandates are not necessary in school,"" period. they went on to explain, ""even in unvaccinated children, rates of serious disease from covid-19 are similar to that of the seasonal flu, and we do not normally take exceptional precautions in schools for the flu, for which we do not normally implement school mask mandates.""  ny high school student spent hours out in the cold after she refused to wear a mask you knew that, but they're finally admitting it. now they reviewed the data on school and masking and ""find that well-controlled real-world studies consistently failed to find a convincing benefit, while studies cited to support masking have serious flaws."" once again, we've been telling you this for a year and a half. and now it's completely confirmed. there doesn't seem to be a debate about it.  masks don't benefit children. they actively harm children. child development experts are weighing in and saying, oh yes, long-term use of masks on children can inflict profound cognitive damage. again, you could have guessed this. now it's confirmed. one therapist, for example, in palm beach, florida, says her clinic has seen a 364% increase in referrals of babies and toddlers. why? masks.  everything about this is shocking. but what's most shocking of all is that we are virtually alone in doing this. in other countries in the civilized world, the uk, norway, many others, kids are not required to wear masks in school because they don't work, and they hurt kids. this is not a mystery. it's not a secret. school officials know this, there's no logic or data to support their position. so when you don't have evidence or a legitimate justification, you move very quickly to indoctrination. you lie because you have no choice. here's an assistant superintendent for wake county public schools, that would be in north carolina, areep called paul koh. he explains on video his plan to reprogram children so they obey him without question.      
      coronavirus prevention face mask protection n95 masks and medical surgical masks at home .
       (istock) koh:  it's like if you're a two-year-old, you're trying to help them practice for age three and then four when they're going into pre-k classrooms. and then from there, you're trying to help them get into a normalized situation wearing masks, potentially, in a kindergarten classroom and so forth. so that's what we're trying to do. okay, so there's no reason to have a country in which our children are, ""educated by people like that,"" in which you're required by law to hand your kids over to people like that. people who are clearly psychologically damaged, who have agendas that have nothing to do with education, and are, in fact, sinister. why are they doing this? well, of course, because long term, this is how you maintain power. if you've got nothing to convince people with, you manipulate them. you weaken the young people, you degrade their mental health. that's how you maintain control. take a look at these pictures from oxford middle school in the state of  connecticut . you can see students in a band playing instruments with masks over their faces. but even more ridiculous, the instruments themselves have masks. now, it's easy to laugh at this, but it's also horrifying. think about the brainwashing required to do this with a straight face.    video by the way, the lunacy extends to adults. in broward county,  florida , a free state most of the time, anyone who wants to check out a book from the library must have a mask on. so, comply or you're not allowed to read. now, some people have medical exemptions where they don't have to wear a mask, they have copd, for example. if you have a medical exemption, you don't get to read as many books. you have to make do with a much smaller selection of reading material.  library guest: do we have any idea when they're going to start honoring these exemptions because this is ridiculous? library worker: we don't know anything about that, we just follow what they tell us to do and i do apologize.  yeah, let's put kids on zoom class for two years and prevent adults from reading books unless they obey. pretty hard to justify any of this in terms a logical person would understand. so they're not even bothering, the people enforcing these rules aren't arguing on their behalf. they're just laughing at you and making you do it. here's an example from los angeles; the mayor of that city, the second-biggest city in this country,  eric garcetti , explains that he wasn't wearing a mask when he took an indoor photograph with magic johnson, someone who's technically immunocompromised, but whatever. here's his his explanation. la's garcetti mocked for response to maskless picture garcetti: when people ask for a photograph, i hold my breath … there's a zero percent chance of infection from that … i won't pull it down for two seconds anymore, that's easy. but to me, it is crystal clear that nobody has been endangered by that.  i held my breath. i did not inhale. notice he doesn't blush when he says that, he just says it and expects you to believe it. that's a totally adequate explanation. can i get away with it? i didn't breathe. therefore, it's fine. try that on a commercial airline flight.  gavin newsom  did the same. he also took a maskless photograph with magic johnson. by the way, for the record, that's fine. but these are the people who are telling you it's a crime. so when they're caught doing it, what's their excuse? well, in the case of the governor of california, he says he had the mask in his hand, so he was safe. click here to get the fox news app newsom: you're correct, i was very judicious yesterday, very judicious, and you'll see the photo that i did take where magic was kind enough, generous enough, to ask me for a photograph. and in my left hand is the mask and i took a photo. the rest of the time i wore it, as we all should, not when i had a glass of water or anything and encourage everybody else to do so. and that's it.  not actually encouraging everyone else to do this. more like requiring everyone else to do so. that and a whole lot of other things that have no scientific justification. but as long as you have a mask in your left hand, and you happen to be the governor of california and you make the rules, you don't have to obey the rules. that's how it works. so again, these explanations are getting more transparent, more absurd. and that should make you a little worried because when people stop explaining things, or trying to justify them, or try to win you over their position, what do they have left to make you comply? force. that's it. they just have force.  this article is adapted from tucker carlson's opening commentary on the february 3, 2022, edition of ""tucker carlson tonight.""

   the country where the coronavirus outbreak emerged two years ago launched a locked-down winter  olympics  on friday, proudly projecting its might on the most global of stages even as some western governments mounted a diplomatic boycott over the way china treats millions of its own people. beijing becomes the first city to host both winter and summer olympic games. and while some are staying away from the second pandemic olympics in six months, many other world leaders planned to attend the opening ceremony. most notable: russian president vladimir putin, who met privately with china’s xi jinping earlier in the day as a dangerous standoff unfolds at russia’s border with ukraine. the olympics — and the opening ceremony — are always an exercise in performance for the host nation, a chance to showcase its culture, define its place in the world, flaunt its best side. that's something china in particular has been consumed with for decades. but at this year's beijing games, the gulf between performance and reality will be particularly jarring.       live updates: beijing olympics     
      people wait for the opening ceremony of the 2022 winter olympics, friday, feb. 4, 2022, in beijing.
       (ap photo/jae c. hong) fourteen years ago, a beijing opening ceremony that featured massive pyrotechnic displays and thousands of card-flipping performers set a new standard of extravagance to start an olympics that no host since has matched. it was a fitting start to an event often billed as china's ""coming out."" now, no matter how you view it, china has arrived — and the opening ceremony returns to the same now-familiar, lattice-encased national stadium known as the bird’s nest, built in consultation with chinese dissident artist ai weiwei. but the hope for a more open china that accompanied those first games has faded. for beijing, these olympics are a confirmation of its status as world player and power. but for many outside china, particularly in the west, they have become a confirmation of the country’s increasingly authoritarian turn. chinese authorities are crushing pro-democracy activism, tightening their control over hong kong, becoming more confrontational with taiwan and interning muslim uyghurs in the far west — a crackdown the u.s. government and others have called genocide. the pandemic also weighs heavily on this year's games, just as it did last summer in tokyo. more than two years after the first covid-19 cases were identified in china’s hubei province, nearly 6 million human beings have died and hundreds of millions more around the world have been sickened. the host country itself claims some of the lowest rates of death and illness from the virus, in part because of sweeping lockdowns imposed by the government that were instantly apparent to anyone arriving to compete in or attend the winter games. in the lead-up to the olympics, china’s suppression of dissent was also on display in the controversy surrounding chinese tennis star peng shuai. she disappeared from public view last year after accusing a former communist party official of sexual assault. her accusation was quickly scrubbed from the internet, and discussion of it remains heavily censored. concerned for her safety, tennis greats and others outside china demanded on social media to know, ""where is peng shuai?"" a surreal cat-and-mouse game has since unfolded, with peng making a brief appearance at a youth tennis event and speaking by video link with international olympic committee president thomas bach as part of efforts to allay concerns about her. while the political issues have overshadowed the run-up, as with any olympics, attention will shift saturday — at least partially — from the geopolitical issues of the day to the athletes themselves. all eyes turn now to whether alpine skiing superstar mikaela shiffrin, who already owns three olympic medals, can exceed sky-high expectations. how snowboard sensation shaun white will cap off his olympic career — and if the sport’s current standard-bearer, chloe kim, will wow us again. and whether russia’s women will sweep the medals in figure skating. and china is pinning its hopes on eileen gu, the 18-year-old, american-born freestyle skier who has chosen to compete for her mother’s native country and could win three gold medals. as they compete, the conditions imposed by chinese authorities offer a stark contrast to the party atmosphere of the 2008 games. some flight attendants, immigration officials and hotel staff have been covered head-to-toe in hazmat gear, masks and goggles. there is a daily testing regimen for all attendees, followed by lengthy quarantines for all those testing positive. even so, there is no passing from the olympic venues through the ever-present cordons of chain-link fence — covered in cheery messages of a ""shared future together"" — into the city itself, another point of divergence with the 2008 games. china itself has also transformed in the years since. then, it was an emerging global economic force making its biggest leap yet onto the global stage by hosting those games. now it is a fully realized superpower hosting these. xi, who was the head of the 2008 olympics, now runs the entire country and has encouraged a personality-driven campaign of adulation. gone are the hopeful statements from organizers and western governments that hosting the olympics would pressure the ruling communist party to clean up what they called its problematic human rights record and to become a more responsible international citizen. today, three decades after its troops crushed massive democracy demonstrations in tiananmen square, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of chinese, the government has locked up more than 1 million members of minority groups, mostly muslim uyghurs from its far-western xinjiang region, in mass internment camps. the situation has led human rights groups to dub these the ""genocide games."" china says the camps are ""vocational training and education centers"" that are part of an anti-terror campaign. it denies any human rights violations and says it has restored stability to xinjiang, a region it insisted in the months after the 9/11 attacks was rife with extremism, often with little evidence. such behavior was what led leaders of the united states, britain, australia and canada, among others, to impose a diplomatic boycott on these games, shunning appearances alongside chinese leadership while allowing their athletes to compete. outside the olympic ""bubble"" that separates regular beijingers from olympians and their entourages, some expressed enthusiasm and pride at the world coming to their doorstep. zhang wenquan, a collector of olympic memorabilia, showed off his wares friday while standing next to a 2008 mascot. he was excited, but the excitement was tempered by the virus that has changed so much for so many. ""i think the effect of the fireworks is going to be much better than it in 2008,"" he said. ""i really look forward to the opening ceremony. i actually wanted to go to the venue to watch it. i have been trying so hard to watch it at the scene. but because of the epidemic, there may be no chance.""

   gain-of-function research conducted at the  wuhan  institute of virology has widely been suspected as a source of the pandemic. ""what they were doing at the wuhan institute of virology was taking dangerous, scary viruses and making them scarier,"" jamie metzl of the atlantic council told fox news. in basic terms, the point of gain-of-function research is to make a  virus  more dangerous. scientists argue that, with this research, they can be prepared to handle it if one day the virus were to mutate naturally. however, critics argue that if viruses evolve in that way, it might take thousands of years, or it might never happen at all. scientists are often doing gain-of-function research for months for no practical purpose, such as using it to build their own resumes.     
      dr. shi zhengli, known as the wuhan institute 'bat lady' reportedly worked with military officials at the lab, despite denying it.  (aptn)
       but whatever the motive is, today the research continues around the world, with little oversight, and often funded by taxpayers.  the national institutes of health (nih), which approves funding for these projects, said, ""while such research is inherently risk, the risk of not doing this type of research and not being prepared for the next pandemic is also high."" hhs, nih under fire from house gop seeking answers on wuhan's covid origins there have been repeated allegations and denials that such research, funded by the nih, was going on in wuhan, china.  dr anthony fauci  was adamant in an outburst with u.s. senator  rand paul , r-ky., back in 2021. ""you are entirely, entirely and completely incorrect that the nih has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the wuhan institute,"" dr. fauci insisted to sen. rand paul.  but his argument relies on semantics. the nih watered down its definition of gain-of-function over the last decade to get around a funding pause. the funding pause was put in place after accidents involving an engineered bird flu.

       (photo by greg nash/pool/afp via getty images  |   photographer: greg nash/the hill/bloomberg via getty images) now the nih defines gain-of-function research as ""research involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens."" after the nih changed the definition of gain-of-function research, it was able to avoid the classification in wuhan after eco health alliance argued that these particular bat viruses did not spread among humans - even though they were planning to test how the viruses would mutate to threaten humans. ""there were lots of warnings that chinese science was becoming an increasing threat to the rest of the world"" says metzl. fauci's gain-of-function research and why i'll continue to hold him, his allies accountable almost all experts argue that eco health alliance's research clearly comes under the gain-of-function umbrella. but it’s not just the classification, it’s the way the nih approves the funding for this kind of research which is also opaque.  for example, in 2012 after the accidents with bird flu, a funding pause was put in place and an nih review group was set up to oversee any funding of this kind.  the group was known informally as a ""ferrets committee,"" but nobody knows who was on it. the group's work was confidential and no records of its proceedings are public. then in 2017, the nih watered down this committee’s power to block projects; recasting the panel as strictly an advisory body, which effectively put all the power back in the hands of the nih. the nih was basically overseeing itself, and that continues to this day. the funding pause was lifted using the new definition, and it was back to business as usual.

       on top of all this, an independent review process is supposed to be carried out before any funding of risky  research  goes ahead, but experts involved have told fox news that the reviews are often not done, done poorly or simply ignored. experts all argue it has to change. doctor roland weisendanger said, ""we need independent agencies to control this, like for nuclear power reactors."" australian professor nikolai petrovsky said, 'not all gain-of-function research sets out to create harmful pathogens, but it can happen by accident. that is unfortunate, but we should not throw the baby out with the bath water as a result."" ""we have to be careful to distinguish what might be just a chance event in a laboratory where a virus became adapted to human cells, and from there was able to jump from a petri dish to one of the people handling that virus. and that would have no sinister connotations at all. we have to accept there is some risk of laboratory experiments, and we try and manage those risks that we shouldn't be banning laboratory experiments,"" petrovsky explained. republican  congressmen on thursday called on the seven scientists who reversed their opinions about the lab-leak theory in wuhan to provide answers under oath after scientists changed their views after speaking with dr. fauci and dr. francis collins. last year, the state department acknowledged that the wuhan institute of virology had not disclosed gain-of-function research linked to the bat related coronavirus and had engaged in research on behalf of the chinese military. many experts agreed that has really changed - particularly when it comes to china. ""china is, in many ways, a wild west of scientific research,"" metzl said. the point is, however you look at it, and whether you acknowledge there must be some risk for scientific progress - or whether you believe this is tampering with nature unnecessarily - that almost everyone should agree that this is a murky world, where scientists hide behind classifications, and shifting definitions, all without having to disclose exactly what the purpose of the research is. click here to get the fox news app certainly there is a growing belief in government that a 9/11-style commission needs to look into the origins of covid-19, and into how taxpayer dollars are used to fund gain-of-function research to ensure that another pandemic never happens again.   ",2022-02

       (al drago/bloomberg) gain-of-function research involves extracting viruses from animals to artificially engineer in a laboratory to make them more transmissible and deadly to humans. the purpose of such research is to let scientists get ahead of the curb in developing treatments for certain infectious diseases. demands for answers surrounding the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in wuhan in november 2019, have led to calls for white house chief medical adviser  dr. anthony fauci's  resignation and a general feeling of distrust between some citizens and government leaders. rand paul visits the big board bar in dc: ‘anybody who wants to resist the man is somebody i want to meet’ fauci has previously denied u.s. involvement in gain-of-function research at a wuhan research lab called the wuhan institute of virology, which the world health organization (who) has investigated in its search for answers regarding covid-19's origins.  however, a $600,000 grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), which fauci serves as director, went to a group called ecohealth alliance, which then paid the wuhan lab to study the risk that bat coronaviruses could infect humans. nih acting director lawrence tabak previously accused ecohealth alliance of not being transparent about the work that was taking place in the lab.

   cnn political analyst and politico white house correspondent laura barrón-lópez claimed a recent political ad attacking hypocritical mask policies pushed by  celebrities  and  politicians  as ""not truthful or honest."" during sunday’s ""inside politics"" highlighted an ad put out by n2 america, a right-leaning group that focuses on suburban americans, criticized democrats and teacher unions for pushing mandatory mask policies in schools.  the ad shows kids watching adults in sporting events and celebrities at an award show maskless, later contrasted with pictures of kids at school in masks.  sen. rand paul says mask mandates were always about ‘submission’

""more parents now say in polls, that they would rather their kid be in a consistent, educational setting. yes, most schools are open, but not have the disruptions of the pandemic, than they are worried about their kid getting covid. and, you know, you’re a parent, every parent has to make those choices,"" phillips said before playing n2's ad.  phillips acknowledged parents’ frustrations by referencing the recent scandals surrounding democrats like governor  gavin newsom  and los angeles mayor  eric garcetti  who were  photographed without masks  during a football game.

""i mean, look, that’s a political ad, so it’s not going to be truthful or honest or any of those things. what’s also happening here, is that republicans for the majority of this pandemic have told their base, have told people in their states, don’t wear masks, don’t get vaccinated. we may even give you incentives to not get vaccinated, you know, you die, okay. like, that’s the way they’ve treated this pandemic,"" barrón-lópez said. ""and that’s contributed to the fact that their children can’t go back to school. that kids can’t go back to school because people are deciding that they don’t want to get vaccinated and care about other people.""  she added ""that’s a part of this whole thing, that if you had asked any of us 10 or 12 years ago, that that’s the way that this country would have handled a pandemic, i don’t think we would have said that, which is that it would have been become such a culture war under public health, but that’s what the administration is also facing."" politico national correspondent meredith mcgraw weighed in and said that parents see democrats like newsom maskless at public events and get upset at the inconsistent messaging.  dr. ezekiel emanuel issues apology for false covid claim in msnbc interview: ‘i misspoke’   ""i think a lot of people are looking for an exit ramp right now. there’s such pandemic fatigue at this point. and i think when you see photos like that one of newsom and garcetti at the l.a. rams stadium in los angeles, it’s hard for a lot of people to stomach the idea that their kids can’t take their mask off unless they’re eating, and yet they can see public figures at a huge, crowded event be able to take their masks off and sort of live their lives. so i think a lot of people are just really desperate and looking for some sort of consistent messaging on how we can move forward,"" mcgraw said.

   every american should be worried about the  covid generation . over the past two years, our country’s children have lost a huge part of their education – and they’re now at risk of losing their futures.  rescuing these kids is urgently important, for their sake and our nation’s.  today’s students  are tomorrow’s leaders, and if they aren’t prepared, america itself won’t be able to lead. what’s happening to kids breaks my heart. even before the pandemic, they were struggling to find the best shot at the best life. pre-covid, two-thirds of america’s elementary and middle-school students weren’t proficient in reading. nearly the same number weren’t proficient at math. yet instead of helping kids get ahead, the  past two years  pushed them further behind. war on critical race theory: gov. noem emerges as national leader in fight against classroom indoctrination school lockdowns and virtual learning have been a total disaster. it’s now clear that school lockdowns had nearly zero effect on saving lives, but they did dramatic damage to student’s lives. almost 100% of teachers reported seeing their students fail to learn during the pandemic, and sure enough, the typical k-12 student is now four months behind in reading and five months behind in math.    video black and brown students suffered even more – they lost half a year. low-income income students lost even more than that. these are the kinds of kids i grew up with in rural south carolina. their futures depend on a great education they’re just not getting. even one lost day of learning is unacceptable. six months is unthinkable. you can’t afford to be six months behind when you’re a sixth grader learning algebra. you can’t afford it when you’re in 12th grade preparing to go to college or get a job. and if you spent half of first grade missing out, you’re going to spend the rest of your life trying to catch up. as a mother, it pains me to think about the future these kids are facing. the mental health issues, the lack of social skills, the lessons that were never learned – the covid generation is in for a rough ride. we’re failing to prepare the citizens who will soon be called on to defend our freedom and lead the world.   you think we have a labor crisis now? imagine how much worse things will get when these students graduate and try to get jobs. millions won’t have the training and skills they need. the typical student could already make $61,000 less in life because of how they were taught – or rather, not taught – during the pandemic.  and we aren’t even done with this crisis. our students deserve the best life possible, not a life of missed opportunities and unmet potential. not only that: if this crisis continues, do you think america can compete with the world? we closed schools and hurt kids far more than many other countries. our economy will suffer for years if something doesn’t change fast. so will our national security.    video we’re failing to prepare the citizens who will soon be called on to defend our freedom and lead the world. america is in a life-or-death struggle with countries like communist china. how we raise the next generation of americans will determine whether we win. saving the covid generation is a moral necessity. yet at the exact moment our country’s children need help, in so many cases, they’re being hurt even more. today’s democratic party is joined at the hip with teachers’ unions. these are the same unions that fought to keep schools closed for months on end and are now shutting down schools once again from coast to coast. apparently they’re more concerned with suspending students who don’t wear masks than teaching students to read, write and rise.   video what’s worse, democrats and their activist allies are pushing dangerous concepts like critical race theory on students. they’re telling a 5-year-old white girl she’s racist, and if she’s black or brown, they’re telling her she’s a helpless victim who will never be good enough. such low expectations are just high-minded bigotry. we should help students unlock their unique potential, not lump them into groups based on race and gender. we should enable every student to lift themselves up, not tear them down. click here to get the opinion newsletter our country’s children deserve better. parents are demanding better. and republicans are ready to deliver better. we stand for educating kids, full stop.  that’s why republican governors and state lawmakers are passing real school choice that gives every family the freedom to pick the best education for their kids. and we stand for teaching kids what they need to succeed – and what america needs to survive and thrive.    video students should learn to love our country, not loathe it, which is why gop-led states are stopping critical race theory in its tracks. students should see that while our nation isn’t perfect, they’re still blessed to live in america, and they have a role in making our union more perfect. click here to get the fox news app the past two years made clear that education needs a transformation from top to bottom. it’s failing the people who are our future, when it should be helping them claim that future.  we can’t let the covid generation become the lost generation. they’re counting on us. and we, as a country, are counting on them. click here to read more from nikki haley  ",2022-02

   gofundme's suspension of millions to support  protesting truckers in canada  shocked many, particularly when the company initially announced its intention to distribute the money to other charities.   it was less of a surprise for those of us who have  criticized the company  for years over its use of the platform to target and block funds for conservative and libertarian causes. indeed, the company has revised an old practice known as the ""nag's head light"" in luring the unsuspecting into what has become a liberal lockbox on funds. gofundme, now nixing canadian trucker fundraiser, promoted capitol hill occupied protest appeal in the carolinas, locals would sometimes tie a lantern under the head of a horse to lure ships to their doom. thinking the light was a ship in deep water, the ships would unwittingly sail into the shore rocks, where they would be stripped of their cargo. that is how the resort town nag's head,  north carolina , got its name. gofundme is the ultimate nag's head operation. it draws conservative and libertarian causes to its shore with promises of being a neutral crowdfunding site. at its creation, the founders pledged to change the world by ""disrupting giving"" by handing control to average people in supporting others with common values and views.   video the easy-to-use technology and need for crowdfunding services quickly expanded the company into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. however, it soon became clear that the company was using its control of funds to advance its own political agenda. worse yet, the company effectively coaxed groups into fundraising campaigns on its site, only to freeze accounts before the money could be used. gofundme backtracks on redistributing money for canadian truckers, under threat of fraud investigation in the case of the canadian truckers protesting covid mandate, the company perfectly replicated the nag's head light. it allowed people to donate over $10 million, thinking that they were helping the truckers and presumably not donating to other sites. it then suspended the account and announced that it would distribute the money to other charities in consultation with the truckers. once the ships crashed on its rocks, it was literally going to salvage the wreckage. it is a familiar pattern for the company in allowing people to send money for badly needed support only to lock the funds away at the last minute.   the announcement was breathtakingly moronic and led some to call for criminal investigations. it turns out that soliciting funds for one reason and then using them for another (""better"") cause is considered fraud in some circles. the company quickly backtracked. however, it still refused to allow the donations to go to the truckers. it will return the money.  in the meantime, critical time and support has been lost for those who trusted the company. it is a familiar pattern for the company in allowing people to send money for badly needed support only to lock the funds away at the last minute. the company's record has moved it well beyond any plausible deniability that it is not using access to donations as a way of advancing its own priorities. consider gofundme's freezing of funds for legal defense funds. one would think that funding litigation costs would be unassailable since it is an effort to secure judicial review of the underlying merits of a case or a cause. after all, if a cause is based on disinformation, a court can quickly sort out the truth. right? wrong.   video gofundme froze donations needed to support kyle rittenhouse's legal defense because he was accused of a violent crime. however, that is the point of a trial. he was  accused  of a crime, and he was entitled to a presumption of innocence. however, the media ran false accounts of the story while social media companies like tiktok censored pro-rittenhouse material. one police officer was fired for simply donating to rittenhouse anonymously on gofundme. neither the company nor the media came to the defense of norfolk police officer william kelly. rittenhouse was, of course, acquitted. then gofundme released the funds after they were no longer needed to support his trial. the company also suspended litigation funds for accused police officers as well as parents who sought to challenge vaccinate mandates in courts. when the company blocked the distribution of donations to rittenhouse, it declared, ""gofundme’s terms of service prohibit raising money for the legal defense of an alleged violent crime.""  ted cruz demands ftc launch investigation into gofundme for seizing trucker convoy funds it is a ridiculous policy since defendants have a presumption of innocence and all parties should be able to present their best cases before independent judges. that includes canadian truckers, black lives matter, antifa and other groups facing litigation. moreover, critics have noted that the company has supported legal funds supporting rioters in various cities as well as an appeal for the 2020 seattle capitol hill occupied protest (chop).   video the hypocrisy of the company on such issues has been flagged repeatedly, including by tesla ceo elon musk. it does not matter. like the social media companies, gofundme controls billions in funds and has become the very scourge that it was designed to combat. rather than empower average people, it now operates more like a corporate overlord on what causes are worthy of crowdfunding. click here to get the opinion newsletter notably, gofundme relied on accounts from the canadian government to label the truckers as violent despite the fact that the truckers are protesting the government.  gofundme controls billions in funds and has become the very scourge that it was designed to combat. rather than empower average people, it now operates more like a corporate overlord on what causes are worthy of crowdfunding.   the protests have been largely peaceful, particularly in comparison to the ""mostly peaceful"" protests in past summers (by groups allowed to crowdfund by the company). it is the same pattern used by other companies in serving as a conduit of government priorities and policies.   video youtube and twitter have blocked critics of vladimir putin or governments like india. even the who has supported such censorship to deal with what it now calls the ""infodemic,"" which includes criticism of itself. in the united states, democratic leaders, including president joe biden, have pushed for more corporate censorship on subjects ranging from global warming and gender issues to election integrity and vaccines. as companies like twitter actively silence dissenting voices, gofundme has served as a chokepoint for funds. the result is that many are finding it not only difficult to use social media to voice their views but to use crowdfunding to garner the support of like-minded people.   the inclusion of gofundme in this increasingly united front is particularly chilling. as the supreme court has repeatedly held, money is a critical part of free speech. you speak through your donations and those funds then support further free speech and associations.  click here to get the fox news app as companies like twitter actively silence dissenting voices, gofundme has served as a chokepoint for funds. the result is that many are finding it not only difficult to use social media to voice their views but to use crowdfunding to garner the support of like-minded people. gofundme can clearly redefine itself as a progressive company. it has free speech rights like those who it is seeking to silence. like many in the media, the company has largely written off half of the country. the problem for the company will be when the crowd in its crowdfunding business goes somewhere else. click here to read more from jonathan turley  ",2022-02

   now in its second year, the biden administration, along with congressional democrats, is still prescribing the wrong medicine for  healing the economy  during covid. despite the narrowest of majorities in the house and senate, democrats insist on governing through one-party rule. that’s political malpractice. americans want commonsense solutions and real results, not political power plays by the majority party. the democrats’ one-party rule of washington have blinded them to a fundamental truth –  pandemics  are not partisan. as a leader on the house ways and means committee, i’ve witnessed firsthand how the  white house  and its allies in congress have consistently misdiagnosed the problems ailing our economy and chosen partisanship over progress. as a result, american families are continuing to suffer from the effects of skyrocketing inflation, stagnant wage growth and an economy that is no longer working for them. fauci's gain-of-function conspiracy and why i'll continue to hold him, his allies accountable throughout his campaign, president biden promised to use his many years of experience in washington to bring the country together with renewed purpose to attack the pandemic. yet these optimistic assurances – and biden’s campaign commitments – were quickly thrown aside and replaced with a completely partisan agenda.   video soon after his inauguration, the progressive left took charge in congress. led by speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and senate majority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., democrats used a budget procedure known as ""reconciliation"" to pass a massive, partisan $1.9 trillion so-called ""economic relief"" package with no republican input or support.  yet despite being advertised as a ""covid relief package,"" less than 9% of the funding went directly to fight the virus. the rest indulged progressive priorities that dramatically increased wasteful spending and fueled a spike in inflation we have not witnessed in 40 years.  this reckless, liberal spending spree was the direct result of one-party politics. and it’s the american people who pay the price as spiraling costs for food, housing, and energy eat away at their hard-earned paychecks. one-party rule has not addressed this pandemic and improved our country.    unfortunately, the president’s partisan approach didn’t end with that spending spree. instead, democrats decided to double down and ram through yet another entirely partisan bill that would impose crippling tax increases and even more spending in what they called, ironically, the build back better plan.  here again, democrats had an opportunity to work together with republicans to find commonsense solutions, but they chose the partisan path instead. for instance, during our ways and means committee work, republicans offered amendments that would divert tax dollars away from wasteful spending and toward coronavirus testing, rural health and protecting seniors. but democrats refused. they chose to prioritize party over public health.   video the so-called build back better plan passed the house last fall on another party line vote and is – at least for now – stalled in the senate. and for good reason. this measure contains about $2 trillion in job killing tax increases on individuals and small businesses. it tosses in even more spending that will only exacerbate the historic inflation plaguing the american people and further increases the deficit.  click here to get the opinion newsletter the democrats’ bill also does nothing to promote longer-term economic growth. its main emphasis is on the demand-side of the economy, putting short-term money in people’s pockets through a variety of government spending programs. this imbalance – short-term demand-side stimulus without attention to the supply side – is another reason why inflation is now red hot. as a result, a recent report from a nonpartisan group at the university of pennsylvania found that american families spent $3,500 more on average in 2021 than in 2020.  democrats also had a chance to work with republicans to find commonsense solutions to the rising cost of prescription drugs for seniors by capping their out-of-pocket costs. i know from my position serving on the ways and means committee that such a solution was possible. instead, democrats went their own way, again pursuing partisan policies that impose federal price controls, potentially limiting access to medical innovations and new cures to save lives.   video promoting greater retirement savings and security was another missed opportunity to explore new ideas. last year, the ways and means committee passed a major piece of retirement security legislation that accomplished this on a unanimous, bipartisan vote. but once again, speaker pelosi decided to ignore our efforts, and instead approach retirement provisions as a partisan issue in the house build back better bill. click here to get the fox news app the american people are justifiably tired and frustrated with covid, but they are also quickly losing patience with democrat politicians that promote partisan power over commonsense solutions. a year into the biden presidency, democrats have missed numerous opportunities to bring the country together to fight the virus and grow the economy.  one-party rule has not addressed this pandemic and improved our country. the president and the democrats have significantly missed the mark on the challenges we face, and what’s needed to heal the nation. unfortunately for all of us, they don’t understand that

   workers of the world unite. you have nothing to lose but your chains. that's from karl marx, of course. he wrote that famous phrase in 1848. the weird thing is, it's pretty likely that marx himself never met an actual worker.   wait a second. he didn't spend a decade in a cotton mill, witnessing the oppression firsthand. no. karl marx never spent a moment in a factory. he was a rich kid who became a journalist. of course he was. but for more than 150 years, karl marx inspired generations of other rich kids who also became journalists to repeat his line or variations of it.   over time, workers became working men or working class and then with feminism, working people or working families, but the idea itself never changed. ordinary people, wage earners, are getting shafted, so they've got to unite. they've got to come together for protection and for dignity. this was the idea, of course, behind the organized labor movement, and every democratic president from andrew jackson until now has made the very same point over and over again.

      justin trudeau, canada's prime minister, during a news conference from the national capital region in canada on monday, jan. 31, 2022. 
       (adrian wyld/the canadian press/bloomberg via getty images) or consider what's happening right now in canada. thousands of truck drivers have descended on ottawa, the capital city, to protest the tyranny of justin trudeau's government. justin trudeau does not like truck drivers. he thinks they're revolting. justin trudeau likes private equity barons and tech moguls, the only people who give him money. trudeau is not in ottawa right now. in fact, he and his family fled when the truck drivers arrived and they've been in hiding ever since. so when the revolution he has been calling for finally arrived, justin trudeau wasn't there to see it. he ran away in terror, kind of sad.   so instead, in his place, his friend mark carney has been speaking for him. carney is a former goldman sachs executive who many believe will replace justin trudeau if trudeau ever decides to give up power. in a recent op-ed, mark carney vented his rage at the impudent truckers in ottawa and anyone who sent them money on the internet.   ""anyone sending money to the convoy should be in no doubt,"" carney wrote. ""you are funding sedition. foreign funders of an insurrection interfered in our domestic affairs from the start.""   got it? that is not a protest. it's sedition. it's an insurrection. clearly, mark carney's been watching a lot of cnn up there in canada and that's why he's concluded the truckers should be crushed by force.   ""those who are still helping to extend this occupation must be identified and punished to the full force of the law."" people who sent the money should be prosecuted. if they're not prosecuted, mark carney fears, ""the constant blaring of horns at all hours will bankrupt our businesses.""   cnn calls freedom convoy protest ‘sedition,’ threat to democracy’   are you laughing yet? so, the very same finance ghouls who cheered lockdowns for two solid years are now deeply concerned that small businesses might be hurt by the trucker protests. hilarious. it'll be interesting, by the way, to pull small business owners in ottawa to see what they think. how did they feel about the truckers? some of you know exactly what those results would be, but no one's doing that poll, of course. instead, they found an easier way.  justin trudeau has just ordered police to shut the whole thing down. how do you do that? how do you stop a truck protest? simple. you seize their fuel. that's exactly what police in canada are doing.  twitter video:  so, in fact, yes, they are taking fuel right away for people as they attempt to fuel their vehicles.    ok, so we are, through much practice, connoisseurs of irony. so, let's pause a moment to savor the irony here. the very same people told us we had to defund the police are now telling the police to seize fuel from working-class canadians who are trying to stay alive in arctic temperatures.   as they used to say in the 1960s, ""scratch a liberal, and you will find a fascist."" that was a black panther slogan, actually. they weren't entirely stupid. in fact, in this case, they were absolutely right.   according to justin trudeau, possessing gasoline in the city of ottawa is now a crime. now, to be clear, ottawa didn't declare the state of emergency because the truckers lit a courthouse on fire or shot someone or leveled a church. blm did all of those things, but justin trudeau strongly supports blm.   he reaffirmed to support the other day. here's the problem. we're going to let the mayor of ottawa explain why peaceful truck drivers pose an imminent danger to canada.    video canadian-style trucker protests spread throughout the world   ottowa mayor:  it's disturbing when you see the protests turning into what looks like some kind of a fun carnival where they've got bouncy castles and hot tubs and saunas, a complete insult to the people who are putting up with this nonsense for the last seven days, and it shows a great deal of insensitivity.   they've got bouncy castles for kids, growls the childless mayor of ottawa, let's hurt them. yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a dark scene in truckistan tonight. the kids are on the bouncy castles. of course, at the same time, their parents are flaunting the authority of the people in charge and that is the crime. one protester, a clear white supremacist, explained his motives for protest.   twitter video: where the hell were you? you weren't there? but, now you want to come out in the freezing cold to oppose my fundamental human rights and freedoms. i'm not going to have it. i'm a black man standing beside my brother right here. this is my brother right here and none of you have the right to tell me who to associate with and who not to associate with me because you did not come out and voice your concerns for the fact that justin trudeau banned me from leaving this country because of my medical decision, because i made a decision that he did not like.   shut up, racist. go back to jamaica with your white supremacy nonsense. by the way, no one in canada's government or the media in canada, which is mostly controlled by the government, is engaging with any of the arguments of people like that. instead, they've gone directly to force as crumbling regimes always do. they don't have an argument to make. all they have is police power and they're using them. officials in ottawa just threatened to criminally investigate the california company gofundme because truckers raised about $10 million on the platform. here's ottawa's police chief bragging about stealing that money:  chief peter sloly: we have, through the efforts of deputy.... who know the mayor and his staff, we've been able to shut down the gofundme program. that's a temporary reprieve because the funds are already moving in different directions. we are now going after supply and fuel coming into the area through investigations and intelligence operations and interdictions, all of which were underway yesterday, fully underway today.   intelligence operations? this is a peaceful, political protest. no one has shown any evidence to the contrary. it's not a drug trafficking or human trafficking operation. it's not  al qaeda . these are canadian citizens who drive trucks for a living, but they're being treated like a terror group. gofundme announced it would redirect the $10 million raised by supporters of the truckers to charities of its choice, presumably blm, which it has supported since the very beginning. in other words, gofundme planned to steal that money.   they were stopped from doing this, by the way, by a number of american attorneys general who threatened to sue the companies. so the company backed off and they're going to refund the money, supposedly. but still, the truckers, the people for whom this money was intended, will not get it. so, in the absence of gofundme doing what it's supposed to do, others are filling the gap. an alternative crowdfunding website called give send go has stepped up and raised already more than $5 million for the truckers. how long till they try to shut that down too?   some canadians are clearly worried about that. they're turning to cryptocurrency. tally coin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses bitcoin. it's not controlled by banks. that's the point. they're hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. now, why is this appealing? no one can steal the money. no government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don't control crypto. bitcoin goes from person a to person b and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two.   it's pretty appealing and you can imagine the long-term consequences here. if the people in charge, in this country and in canada, want to make the u.s. dollar irrelevant, they'll keep acting like this and soon, it will be.   either way, it's becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold the technology has on our human rights is decentralization. that doesn't apply just to crowdfunding, but more than anything to communication. you can't organize if you can't talk to other people. so facebook, for example, to shut down the ""convoy to d.c. group,"" which had amassed 134,000 followers in just two days. no one's allowed to promote the organization anymore. facebook, all day today, has been suppressing positive articles about the truckers in canada. of course they are. that seems like a story, but our media have ignored it. instead, everyone in new york and d.c. and los angeles is cheering on the national security state and its alliance with silicon valley as they come together to crush a human rights movement. it makes sense.  cnn reporter:   those with the so-called freedom convoy say they're staying put until vaccine mandates are dropped, the masks come off and life returns to the way it was.    protester: this whole event has gone beyond just vaccines and it is now about the entire ordeal. protester: we're asking for our freedom.  that's all we want. so, they've been free, free to park big rigs right next to the prime minister's office, free to set up camp in front of the country's national parliament. ottawa police say they have learned much in the past week, especially after reports of assaults, intimidation and allegations of hate speech and symbols.   sloly: this remains, as it was from the beginning, an increasingly volatile and increasingly dangerous demonstration.  cnn reporter :   and it is spreading like a contagion itself right across the country.    it's spreading like a contagion. now, you knew that cnn was the praetorian guard for our ruling class. did you know they serve the same role in canada and what other countries? how much money to cnn take from the government of canada? that'd be worth finding out.

   a mom of two children in bethel,  connecticut , knows very well the struggles with  mask mandates  that many other  families  nationwide have experienced during the  covid pandemic .  she has seen ""tons of rising anxiety"" in her own kids, she said, which she believes are the result of in-school mask mandates.  the connecticut mandates were imposed by democratic gov.  ned lamont  and have been enforced in the public school system during the bulk of the pandemic. alexis telep, 36, who works in radiology (her husband, michael, is in sales), described in a recent phone interview with fox news digital the struggles their son michael, 6, and daughter lyla, 3, have been having. ""it’s heartbreaking,"" alexis telep said. ""i have seen tons of rising anxiety in both my children due to constant masking."" though both children are suffering, telep said, it's the situation with young michael — diagnosed with  autism , sensory processing disorder, claustrophobia, anxiety and adhd — that's particularly vexing.

(there is no independent evidence that the masking caused the child's cough.) ""her teachers tell her she spits germs at everybody without the mask on,"" telep said. ""so she comes home and doesn’t want to take the mask off.""  the girl ""even wears it to bed, for fear of making someone else sick.""  nj mom, forced to get vaccine before family wedding, winds up in er telep said her daughter, as a result of all the masking, now considers herself ""a walking germ.""  the mom finds her daughter's anxiety ""just so sad,"" she told fox news digital.  6-year-old feels ‘trapped'  son michael has a full-day kindergarten schedule. telep called her boy ""a gentle soul — he’s like a little old man in a young body.""  she said michael has been in regular therapy ever since his diagnosis of autism at 18 months old. before the mask mandates, alexis telep said her son's disabilities were ""manageable""; she believes he was actually doing quite well.

   cnn medical analyst dr. leana wen appears to have changed her tune when it comes to the implementation of government imposed restrictions related to the  coronavirus pandemic . during a monday appearance on ""anderson cooper 360,"" the former planned parenthood president argued that ""the science has changed"" surrounding the pandemic, leading her to support the reduction and elimination of restrictions despite previously advocating for some that critics felt were unnecessary or excessive. her commentary coincided with several democrat-led states ending state-wide school mask mandates in recent days, including new jersey and connecticut.

""and so, in this case, i'm not saying – i don’t think anyone, really, is saying – that no one should ever wear masks, rather that the responsibility should shift from a government mandate imposed from the state or the local district of the school … it should shift to an individual responsibility by the family, who can still decide that their child can wear a mask if needed,"" she added.  wen came under fire for the remarks from those who have long opposed coronavirus restrictions, particularly against students who have been at an extremely low risk of severe covid-19 outcomes throughout the pandemic. wen's statements on masks ran in stark contrast to  her views last fall  when she said the country was ""nowhere near"" ready to start lifting mask regulations in schools until all children were vaccinated and other external measures were in place. throughout the pandemic, however, children she  also suggested  at the time that life should be ""hard"" for americans who were not vaccinated, and that those who refused to get the shots should face weekly testing. she has, however, consistently maintained that masks serve as a ""very powerful layer of protection.""

""but we should also be intellectually honest and say that masking has had a cost, especially for the youngest learners, people with english as a second language, children with learning disabilities. there has been a cost to them. so the risk-benefit calculation has really changed,"" she said.

milton friedman has. i certainly hope we have some grainy footage of him lying around.  milton freedman: the wood from which it's made, for all i know, comes from a tree that was cut down on the state of washington. to cut down that tree, it took a saw. to make the saw, it took steel. to make steel, it took iron ore. this black center, we call it lead, but it's really graphite, compressed graphite. i'm not sure where it comes from, but i think it comes from some mines in south america. this red top up here, the eraser, a bit of rubber, probably comes from malaya, where the rubber tree isn't even native. it was imported from south america by some businessmen with the help of the british government. this brass feral, i haven't the slightest idea where it came from or the yellow paint or the paint and made the black lines or the glue that holds it together. literally thousands of people cooperated to make this pencil.  someone likes his weed.  so the moral is obvious. it's not like one person sits in a room and makes a pencil.  as the lady in the pantsuit once said, it takes a village.  now you can use that pencil to write whatever you want, or to gouge your eyes out if you're watching "" the view .""  but this is the case for everything we use today. it's the division of  l abor, which is not referring to twins being born more than 30 minutes apart, cat.  this clipboard right here. the chair i'm in, cat's hair extensions. they all likely weren't made by a single entity, but cooperation of sources, workers, ideas and, of course, labor from people who never even met each other.  marco rubio: socialism is about power and control i wish that was how this show was produced.  imagine if wokeism existed before the pencil was made.  could the division of labor exist?

talk about a carbon footprint. and why #2, why can't they all be equal?  the fact is, nothing would happen because wokeism prevents the cooperation needed for any shared labor. it wouldn't just be pencils, but everything you use. you have to work together, whether you like it or not. and sometimes, you know, we have no choice.    video take the alec baldwin tragedy, if there was an idea, segregation, that woman could be alive today because there would have been an nra instructor on set, and that's cooperation, idea-sharing.  sure. baldwin, a democrat, might not like the instructor's politics, but he's not there for that. he's there to share his safety expertise.  and, an nra dude would have kept a loaded gun out of baldwin's hands.  idea segregation prevents that. wokeism demands you can't benefit from a person's expertise if they're not like you.  james carville: i want to punch ‘piece of s--t’ unvaccinated people in the face the political is now personal. sure, you're having engine problems with your car, and your brother-in-law is a great mechanic, but he's got a ""back the blue"" sticker on his truck. screw it, you'll just walk home.  so now to joe rogan, there's likely no person on earth who's doing more to dismantle idea segregation than him.  the roster of his guests are more diverse than the olympic opening ceremonies, and they're allowed to speak endlessly about whatever so the listener can decide.  it's the antidote to cable tv, where shows rely on the same people who say the same things over and over again.  i mean, look at this show. you get 42 minutes of content divided by five segments and five talking heads. no wonder i'm on drugs, and no wonder cnn hates rogan.  he's widening the universe as they shrink it. at first, the legacy media tried to take him down with his covid content. he had doctors on who disagreed with fauci, the left's patron saint of masks, mandates and mind control.    video but the takedown didn't take. so now some mysterious group released a supercut of joe saying the n-word over a decade or so.  probably matching what previous democrat senators and presidents would say in one afternoon.  the fact that the montage was released after spotify stuck with rogen tells you it's less about the world and more about canning joe.  he's apologized, sincerely.  but we all know, like me watching the first magic mike movie, that will never be enough. the n-word is being used as a tool. they're getting desperate. they want rogen destroyed. i wonder what the angry black male has to say. tyrus, angry black male: greg, thank you for this time. this is not going to be your normal, everyday angry black man. oh, and i'm angry, but not for the reasons you might think. yup. joe rogan said the n-word. hell, he even said it with a hard-ass-r. a bunch of times on a podcast. and yeah, it pissed me off when i first saw it. so. very clever woke.  but you kind of left out a few things like it was 12 years ago. nobody cares what he said 12 years ago. hell, you didn't. where were you then? i'll wait for a response, but we know that will fall on deaf ears. maybe it's time you stop using us african-americans to do your dirty work and fight your battles.  now i get it, you use your favorite little words to get us fired up. racist. systemic. critical. and your new favorite word: misinformation. and that'll get us fired up. and we won't even look at the facts of the whatnots, and we'll just jump in and cancel away with you.  your fight with joe rogan was about covid, but you were losing that conversation, so you needed something else and you went to the good old woke playbook, but you went one too many times.  how about this: fight, joe rogan yourselves. leave us out of it. look, the n-word is bad. i learned his meaning at four years old. that was the first time i was called a n-word by a family member, and i've been called it enough times in my life to where i pretty much consider myself an expert on it.  now i know it's going to be a news flash to you, woke. but us blacks, we understand the word context. joe rogan should keep that word out his mouth. hell, everyone should. he said it then. but you're saying it now, for no other reason than to cancel a man you can't compete with. and you know what? that sounds racist to me, because that's usually when i was called it. i was winning the argument. so you had to pull that out of your bag of tricks because you couldn't compete.  i think you just told on your woke selves. now i just may be an uppity n-word, but that sounds a lot like - and i'll use one of your words - misinformation.  click here to get the fox news app   well, there you go. you don't have to agree with him or you can. either way, we get along like we always do, and he helps me and i help him. that's how it works in life, in making good pencils, making good tv and making good friends.  this article is adapted from greg gutfeld's opening commentary on the february 7, 2022, edition of ""gutfeld!.""

""the major concern is that when we let the virus circulate in any animal host, in addition to humans, the complexity of virus evolution becomes very, very difficult to assess and comprehend,"" he said. ""so the bigger question is, the unmonitored or unchecked transmission of sars-cov-2 in deer and potentially other animals could result in the emergence of completely novel variants that might potentially undermine the protection provided by the current vaccines.""   video kuchipudi also noted that one of the infected deer in the study had covid-19 antibodies from a previous infection, an indication that deer, like humans, can experience breakthrough cases. the staten island deer study has not yet been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal but has been published as a pre-print because of the significance of the findings, kuchipudi said. click here to get the fox news app while humans travel to staten island by ferry or bridge, deer first got there by swimming from new jersey, according to new york city officials. the animals have long caused problems for the borough’s motorists and gardeners. the city has contracted with wildlife management firm white buffalo to control the deer population by performing vasectomies on the bucks. a spokesperson for the city parks department said the most recent estimate for staten island’s deer population is 1,616 animals — a 21% reduction since 2017.

   sweden  has halted wide-scale testing for  covid-19  even among people showing symptoms of an infection, putting an end to the mobile city-square tent sites, drive-in swab centers and home-delivered tests that became ubiquitous during the  pandemic  and provided essential data for tracking its spread. the move puts the scandinavian nation at odds with most of  europe , but some experts say it could become the norm as costly testing yields fewer benefits with the easily transmissible but milder omicron variant and as governments begin to consider treating covid-19 like they do other endemic illnesses. ""we have reached a point where the cost and relevance of the testing is no longer justifiable."" swedish public health agency chief karin tegmark wisell told the national broadcast svt this week.

       (johan nilsson/tt via ap) sweden joins others in announcing end of virus restrictions starting wednesday, only health care and elderly care workers and the most vulnerable will be entitled to free pcr testing if they are symptomatic, while the rest of the population will simply be asked to stay home if they show symptoms that could be covid-19. antigen tests are readily available for purchase in supermarkets and pharmacies, but those results aren't reported to health authorities. private health care providers can also perform tests and offer certificates for international travel, but the cost won't be reimbursed by the state or health insurance. high vaccination rates in sweden are creating optimism among health officials and a late 2020 study released tuesday showing antibodies present in 85% of samples. dr. bharat pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the university of exeter medical school in britain, said that with a substantial percentage of people vaccinated, ""an informed, educated and knowledgeable population"" can be trusted to isolate if they show symptoms without the need for ""wholesale testing that is not going to be value for money."" ""sweden is leading the way, and other nations will inevitably follow,"" pankhania said.

they call law enforcement.  chicago mayor lori lightfoot, 2020: and this is how it's going to be. we will shut you down. we will cite you. and if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail. period.   npr mocked for article on ‘white privilege’ emojis so they went full fascist immediately, and they weren't even competent fascists. these are some of the least impressive, least skilled, least accomplished, least intelligent people in our entire country. you wouldn't hire any of them to clean your gutters, and all of a sudden they had absolute power. so it's probably not too surprising that they went into directions no one could have anticipated. no singing under covid, no dancing, no working, definitely no exercising. we're closing the gyms, in the name of public health. in fact, we're closing the oceans. in 2020, in a moment that should never be forgotten by the sane world, authorities in the state of california arrested a paddleboarder who was exercising by himself off the malibu pier.  nbc 2020:  across the coast in california, fines and handcuffs for bad behavior … one man arrested in malibu for paddleboarding in the pacific, while 22 sunset seekers in socal were cited for trespassing on closed beaches.   so everything about that is kind of stunning, less than two years later, even. but maybe the creepiest part of it is how nonchalantly the nbc newsman reported it like it's totally normal to drag paddleboarders away for swimming alone. because if cops didn't vigorously police the pacific ocean, seagulls could spread disease. apparently, that was the thinking or the lack of it.    video so our  media , almost to a person, acted like the peasants they are, and they cheered on the strongman reflexively, because that's what peasants do. they cheer as the person oppressing them rides by on this horse. msnbc excitedly reported on how police in new jersey, this is very clever, used drones to spy on homeowners in their own backyards. msnbc:  elizabeth, new jersey is now using drones to spread the lifesaving message.  drone:  you are not immune to this virus.  msnbc:  the drones make it easier for police to see into certain areas where access by patrol cars is more difficult. that includes tight spaces between buildings, behind schools and in backyards.  so some robot is screaming at you as you're having a barbecue in your backyard, and msnbc describes that as the ""lifesaving message."" don't depend on these people to save you from tyranny. of course, they'll be cheering it on. that very same month that msnbc aired that unbelievable report, we decided to speak to the governor of new jersey, phil murphy. now, phil murphy is a not very bright finance hack who got rich. how do these people get rich, exactly? but in his case, thanks to the wuhan institute of technology, suddenly  phil murphy  found himself king of the garden state. so we asked his majesty phil murphy, where exactly did he get the right to suspend constitutional rights in new jersey? and here's what he said.  tucker 2020:  the bill of rights, as you well know, protects americans right, enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit, and to congregate together to assemble peacefully. by what authority did you nullify the bill of rights in issuing this order? how do you have the power to do that?   murphy:  that's above my pay grade, tucker. so i wasn't i wasn't thinking of the bill of rights when we did this. ""that's above my pay grade."" so king murphy's got an iq of about 70. how did that guy get to be governor? i mean, that's bad enough, but to give him absolute power? let's go ahead and never do that again, under any circumstance.    video checks and balances exist for a reason. we saw this all over the country.  governors  and local officials abusing their authority, very specifically, to stop christians from attending church, to prevent people from worshiping their god, from exercising their  religion . and somehow, nobody noticed. but voters noticed. last fall, phil murphy almost lost his job in new jersey, which is axiomatically democratic, it's the most democratic state you can think of on the eastern seaboard. so murphy seemed a little confused by this. ""my subjects don't like me, really? i had no idea.""  so he convened a focus group. let's hire mckinsey to find out what's going on here. well, according to new york times, here's what his majesty phil murphy found, ""across the board, voters shared frustrations over public health measures, a sense of pessimism about the future and a deep desire to return to some sense of normalcy."" and by normalcy, of course, they meant getting phil murphy's boot off their necks. so murphy, as we said, seemed a little stunned by this. but he reacted. because in the end, these people are very simple organisms. politicians are. they're not complex, they're not ideological. they respond to what they have to do. to blunt stimuli.  biden at odds with governors from both parties over school mask mandates so he recognizes the midterm elections are coming. so phil murphy, again, not a genius, lifted the state's mask mandates. and that's happening in a lot of different places, blue states. governors in connecticut, oregon, delaware, california, illinois. they're all doing it. even in  new york , where the ""governor"" kathy hochul, - that's what we call an unelected leader whom not a single voter actually voted for - she reached the same conclusion. kathy hochul, the ""governor"" (you know, by the way, in a lot of places, you can be arrested for impersonating a public official, she's not the governor, she was never elected by anybody, and no one's arrested her) apparently has the power to lift the state's indoor mask mandate. so she's doing that. but she shouldn't imagine this is over. they still have power. they don't want to give it up. so the health department in new york is trying to expand the state's quarantine powers, just in case they ever have to put you in a camp. kathy hochul has decided not to lift the mask mandate for schools because, of course, the teachers' unions have more swap than parents do.  meanwhile, the cdc still requires u.s. citizens to get a negative covid test in order to return to their own country. so the cdc has the power to bar you from your own country? really, where do they get that power? anyone at the cdc elected? i don't think so. they are a bunch of incompetent public health administrators. nor, by the way, has the biden administration announced plans to lift the mask mandate on airplanes. now, why would the biden administration be in charge of that? shouldn't congress make that call? they're the ones who voted for that mandate. oh, no, but they didn't. congress never voted on that mandate. the agencies imposed it. you should know that mandate, by the way, does not apply to private jet service. most people who fly private don't own the plane. they rent a plane from a jet company. and those companies don't have to comply with the mask mandate because democratic donors fly on those planes, so they're exempt. the tsa, by the way, announced in august that the airline mask mandate would remain in place at least through march 18. congress had no role in this.

   democrats across the country are scrambling to reverse course on  covid-19  restrictions as this year's  midterm  elections loom.  with the notable exception of the white house, democrats at every level are signaling their support for returning to normal as polls show americans are weary of coronavirus restrictions, which republican states have largely done away with.  according to a  recent poll  by monmouth university, 70% of americans say it’s time for the country to move on from the pandemic, and a decreasing number of americans support  covid -related mandates. president  biden’s  approval ratings on handling covid, once a strength, are also now underwater, with 43% approving and 53% disapproving, according to the poll. house democrats reelection chair calls for rolling back covid restrictions to ‘give people their lives back’ biden has chosen to follow the lead of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), which still recommends universal masking indoors and in schools.  blue defiance but with the midterms ahead, many democrats who once led the way in issuing lockdown orders and mandates over the course of the pandemic are easing restrictions in their states in defiance of the administration. numerous blue state governors this week have announced that they are rolling back coronavirus restrictions, and prominent congressional democrats have also signaled their support for returning to normal.  new york  gov. kathy hochul announced that her state will end its covid-19 mandate requiring face coverings in most indoor public settings but will keep it for schools. illinois announced the same.  rhode island gov. dan mckee said wednesday his state will end its indoor vaccine-or-mask requirement this week, followed by the school mask mandate in march. massachusetts, which is generally considered a blue state but has a centrist republican governor, will end its school mask mandate at the end of the month.  earlier this week, new jersey, connecticut and delaware all disclosed plans to join states that have lifted or never had mask requirements for their schools.  swing states first swing states like michigan, colorado and pennsylvania were among the first democrat-led states to loosen covid-19 restrictions last year. michigan gov. gretchen whitmer, who is up for reelection this year, implemented some of the strictest covid-19 orders in the country in 2020, including banning travel between two residences and the selling of non-essential goods. she lifted most of her restrictions last summer and has since pushed vaccinations as the best way to slow the spread.  colorado gov. jared polis, who is also up for reelection, has taken a similar approach and refused to implement any new mandates. pennsylvania gov. tom wolf, who is unable to run again this year, leaving his seat up for grabs, said in december, ""local municipalities, as you know, i think ought to be free to do with what they want,"" echoing what many republicans like florida gov. ron desantis have been vilified for saying for the past two years. less than a year ago, biden said the lifting of mask mandates in republican-led states amounted to  ""neanderthal thinking.""

""well, first, i just want to re-frame this a little bit about justice sotomayor,"" hostin said.

""i may never ride a subway again without a mask. i may never go indoors to big crowds and ever feel comfortable without a mask, and that's up to me to do that,"" haines said. on twitter, after a news site clipped her remarks, haines maintained she opposed shutdowns, school closures and mask mandates for future, less severe variants of the virus like omicron, given the availability of vaccines. 4. whoopi goldberg rips bill maher co-host whoopi goldberg erupted on hbo  late-night  host bill maher last month after the comedian criticized the ""masked, paranoid world"" of people and governments still insisting on stringent coronavirus routines. maher has been critical of how liberal media has reported on the virus and noted democrats were more likely to believe severe covid-19 outcomes would occur ""if they contract it.""   video goldberg lashed out at maher, telling him to ""stay away from everybody"" if he decided he no longer wanted to follow any of the measures used to prevent spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, and argued he was forgetting that some at-risk people were still unable to get vaccinated. she at one point snapped, ""how dare you be so flippant?"" ""that’s not really funny to people who've lost their kids … or people who've lost family members or dear friends to this,"" goldberg said. ""nobody on the planet really wants to go through this. this is not something we’re doing because it’s, you know, sexually gratifying.""  ""if you're the one who’s not paying attention, and you’re coughing and sneezing … then stay out of the public, man,"" she added. ""nobody wants this. i don’t want it. and i think he’s forgetting that people are still at risk who cannot get vaccinated … little kids under the age of five, or people with health conditions."" 5. co-hosts exit before kamala harris interview  in one of the more bizarre moments in recent live television history, hostin and co-host ana navarro  were informed  in the middle of a broadcast sept. 24 that they had tested positive for covid and needed to leave immediately. as joy behar was set to introduce vice president kamala harris for her first live television interview since taking office, a producer told navarro and hostin to leave the stage. behar revealed after a commercial break that the two had received positive coronavirus tests and had to leave as a precaution.  as the show scrambled to set up a video feed for harris to be interviewed from backstage, remaining co-hosts behar and haines took audience questions for nearly the rest of the episode. the awkward television that ensued lit up social media, as the masked audience members were difficult to hear. the co-hosts crammed in a brief interview with harris at the end of the program. ‘view’ co-host sunny hostin calls on allison gollust to leave cnn over zucker relationship it was later revealed, however, that both hostin and navarro had received  false positive  results and never had covid-19. hostin was particularly upset by the spectacle, as both of her husband's parents died of covid-19. in yet another example of melodramatic coronavirus commentary, navarro said when she returned to the program she had feared for a moment she could ""wipe out"" harris and her family because she had spent time with them earlier that day. 6. hostin asks if republicans 'want their voters to die' hostin questioned republicans’ strategy of opposing vaccine mandates, such as florida republican  gov. ron desantis.  although desantis has  promoted vaccinations , hostin suggested that politicians like him ""want their voters to die"" by not getting the vaccine. ""so the republican strategy is to tell their constituency not to get the vaccine, so do they want their voters to die? like, those are the people that are supporting the republicans. that part i don’t understand,"" hostin said in december. 7. goldberg stunned by testing positive  goldberg channeled the energy of many media liberals who were shocked they could still contract covid-19 despite being vaccinated and engaging in precautionary measures. ""i left a couple of weeks ago, just before the break, because somebody i had been around tested positive for coronavirus, so i left. so i've been gone a long time, i feel,"" goldberg said jan. 5.

""how could she not be much more careful in a room full of such small children?"" she asked. ""stupid thing to do."" much of the criticism of abrams from the right stemmed from her not following protocols she insists children abide by, but republicans have largely opposed school mask mandates as unnecessary and even harmful to youth development and mental health. abrams continues to support them. 10. tennis star scolded over vaccine stance novak djokovic, who is not  vaccinated  against covid-19, was scolded by panelists on abc’s ""the view"" last month after the top-ranked  tennis  star’s appeal against an australian deportation order was dismissed, costing him a chance to play in the  australian open .  ""here is the bottom line, people are not putting up with it. countries are not putting up with it, because it means that every time you sneeze or talk, you are spreading more hassle for them. they’re trying to clean their country up. they’re trying to put everybody in a mask and here you come, and you think tennis needs you that badly? no, honey, no,"" goldberg  said .  click here to get the fox news app the hosts also clashed with guest  michele tafoya , an nbc sportscaster who is vaccinated, last year when she expressed opposition to vaccine mandates. the hosts derided that stance as selfish. fox news' brandon gillespie and cortney o'brien contributed to this report.

       the president is desperately hoping that throwing more money at the problem will help clean up – or at least cover up – the mess he has created. but the truth is that this crisis is not about a lack of tax dollars at his disposal, but rather a lack of leadership in the white house, and democrats’ fundamental dishonesty with the american people about how, when, and where their dollars have been spent to supposedly fight the virus. one would think more public covid-19 tests would have been on the list for uses of tax dollars over the last year, but a bombshell was revealed during last month’s senate hearing with senior white house health officials: the biden administration failed to place new orders for covid-19 tests for the first nine months of the year – from january to september. meanwhile, as millions of americans wait in long lines to get tested, large organizations such as google, the nba, the nfl, and yes, even congress, all receive free, on-demand tests.   video that decision is indicative of how president biden – with the backing of democrats in congress – has mismanaged and wasted american tax dollars on items having nothing to do with combatting covid while creating one crisis after another for the american people. to see how, one simply has to follow the money. on his first day in office, president biden froze billions of dollars in funding, that was appropriated by congress, for construction of the border wall, setting off a chain reaction that has now resulted in the worst border crisis in over a generation. over in congress, just a couple of months later, democrats, at the behest of president biden, put their full energy into passing trillions of dollars in new spending – fueling an explosion in inflation that has driven up prices americans are paying at the gas pump and grocery store. they passed president biden’s $2 trillion bailout bill, claiming it was urgently needed for ""covid relief.""    video but the truth is that less than nine percent of that bill went to public health spending to combat covid-19. a sizeable portion of the other 91 percent effectively became a slush fund for state and local governments – meaning millions of dollars are being wasted and misused to build parking lots in south carolina, plant trees in new york, build golf courses and clubhouses, and even send japanese citizens living in japan and convicted prisoners, including the boston marathon bomber, $1,400 stimulus checks. the list goes on.  but it was not just a rampant waste of taxpayer dollars. president biden also diverted $850 million from covid-19 testing, $151 million from building a supply chain for vaccines and therapeutics, and $850 million from replenishing the strategic national stockpile to instead pay for the housing of illegal immigrants at the border.   video along with the bare grocery store shelves where meat, bread, and vegetables used to be, millions of americans are now competing to find at-home covid-19 tests. today’s covid-19 testing crisis is just the latest in an endless parade of failures by the president. yet despite such failures, the biden administration is now reportedly thinking of asking congress for even more hard-earned taxpayer dollars under the guise of covid-19. click here to get the opinion newsletter it is ridiculous to think that congress should go along with such a request. the administration’s own trail of inflationary fueled spending over the last year has hardly emboldened americans’ confidence that government is a good steward of their tax dollars. what’s worse, congressional democrats have been an enabling accomplice for the white house. for the last twelve months, democrats in control of congress, under president biden’s direction, ignored, then dismissed, and are now trying to explain away the problems they allowed to fester.  click here to get the fox news app every attempt by house and senate republicans to ensure oversight over the biden administration’s supposed covid-19 spending has been stymied or flat out ignored by the controlling party of congress. but failing to answer simple questions as to how their last ""covid-19"" spending binge has seemingly left our country less equipped to handle the virus, is the very reason not another dime of so-called ""covid-relief"" dollars should be handed over to this white house, regardless of how noble the cause may sound.

   shortly after the  coronavirus  outbreak, influential leaders in the science community huddled to say the deadly virus most likely originated naturally from an animal transfer to humans. new reporting from fox news' ""special report"" showed there was an effort by   dr. anthony fauci,  director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, then-national institutes of health director francis collins, and other scientists to not mention the possibility of the virus originating in a lab. the consensus was reached on a call in early 2020 that the lab leak theory should be left out of an  early paper   on covid-19 origins because it will add "" fuel to the conspiracists."" two years later, there is no definitive proof that the virus started in nature or that it leaked from a lab. but the theory that the virus originated at the wuhan institute of virology, which studies coronaviruses, is no longer shunned as a conspiracy and is gaining more traction among scientific communities  calling for further inquiry . fox news special report outlines fresh questions on what fauci, government knew about covid origin fox news talked to several scientists and investigators who have studied covid-19 origins, and here are some reasons – science-based and circumstantial – why they believe the evidence points to the global pandemic originating from a wuhan lab, possibly from a researcher accidentally getting infected during an experiment with coronaviruses and spreading it into the community. ""when you evaluate the two theories, it is so overwhelmingly in favor of the lab leak that everything else is just incidental evidence about the details of what happened,"" said richard muller, emeritus professor of physics at the university of california berkeley, who has been a strong advocate for the lab-leak theory. scientists are not in agreement on the origins of the virus, while the u.s. intelligence community also could not draw conclusions on what started the global pandemic that has killed more than 5.7 million people worldwide.

       (ap photo/susan walsh) 1) no animals have been found to be infected with sars-cov-2 under the natural origin theory, the novel coronavirus, or sars-cov-2, would have originated in an animal and traveled to humans either directly or through an intermediate host animal.  this natural spillover has precedent. for example, researchers traced the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2003 back to  bat caves in china’s yunnan  province, and the likely intermediary host animals were masked palm civets that tested positive for the virus.  the trouble with drawing the same conclusion for covid-19 is that no one has identified an animal that has tested positive for the novel coronavirus that caused the global pandemic. it's not for a lack of trying. investigators tested more than 80,000 animals in  china , including hundreds linked to the huanan seafood market associated with the early cases of covid-19, but ""no positive result was identified for sars-cov-2,"" the world health organization (who) study on the origins of covid-19 says. rand paul seeking answers on covid origins, gain-of-function research from 'convention of civilized countries' ""they tested an unprecedented 80,000 animals covering 209 species, including wild, domestic and market animals … and they found no infections in  animals ,"" muller, the professor emeritus, told fox news digital.  ""they found nothing. but instead of drawing a scientific conclusion from that, the world health organization came up with excuses."" the controversial world health organization (who) study on the origins of covid-19 says the most likely scenario was a transmission from bats to an unknown host animal to humans, while the lab leak is "" e xtremely unlikely.""  but even the  who has  backtracked  and admitted it was too quick to rule out the lab theory and has  revived  its investigation.

       (ap photo/kyle green, file) 2) no evidence of pre-epidemic infections during past coronavirus epidemics, such as sars in 2003 and mers in 2013, there was evidence of extensive human infection from animals prior to the virus mutating to become transmissible between humans and sparking the pandemic, muller said.  investigators tested more than 9,000 human biological samples – including blood, plasma and throat swabs – that were stored at hospitals and blood banks prior to the pandemic, muller said, citing data from the who report.  it was expected that between 100 and 400 would be positive for sars-cov-2, based on the natural outbreak experiences with sars and mers, muller said. but in this case, zero tested positive. ""there is no evidence of multiple animal-to-human transmissions,"" said dr. steven quay, a physician and founder of atossa therapeutics.  muller and quay have worked together on studying coronavirus origins and have  presented their findings to  congress  and in a  wall street journal op-ed . the lack of evidence of pre-pandemic infection and genetic purity of the virus suggests covid-19 wasn’t a natural spillover from animals, but a lab-acquired infection, the scientists say.     
      there have been more than 900,000 people covid-19 deaths in the united states.  
       (istock) 3) the genetic fingerprint of the virus is so unique it has never been observed in a natural coronavirus  quay, who is writing a book on why covid-19 originated from a lab, said sars-cov-2 has a unique trigger on its surface called a furin cleavage site and a unique code in its genes for that site, called a cgg-cgg dimer. this combination has  never been found naturally  and therefore points to a lab-manipulated virus, he says. since 1992, in gain-of-function research experiments, laboratories have inserted furin sites into viruses repeatedly, quay said. the end result is supercharged, more infectious viruses, he said.  ""these gene jockeys have put in a furin site into a virus that didn't have one in the laboratory,"" quay told fox news digital. ""eleven out of 11 times it makes it more effective, more transmissible, more lethal -- all the bad things you'd want. so if you want to juice up a virus and make it more infective or make it go from bats to humans, putting in a furin cleavage site is a great idea."" scientists are not in agreement that the cgg sequences in the furin cleavage site signify the virus was made in a lab. kristian andersen, a virologist at the scripps research institute in california, said such arguments are "" factually incorrect .""   video 4) the virus appeared in humans already ""optimized"" into an extremely contagious version based on sars1 and mers experiences, when the virus becomes capable of human-to-human transmission, it takes weeks to evolve as it spreads through the population and the most contagious forms of the virus dominated. but with covid-19, the virus was pre-adapted for human-to-human transmission from the first patient, quay says. specifically, he said, the part of the virus that interacts with human cells was 99.5% optimized.  ""such early optimization is unprecedented, and it suggests a long period of adaptation that predated its public spread,"" quay and muller  wrote in an op-ed in the wall street journal  about their findings. ""science knows of only one way that could be achieved: simulated natural evolution, growing the virus on human cells until the optimum is achieved."" nih acknowledges us funded gain-of-function at wuhan lab, despite fauci’s denials quay believes the covid-19 virus was taught to infect humans in the laboratory through gain-of-function research on ""humanized mice"" that are repeatedly exposed to the virus to encourage adaptation.  other  studies  refute the idea that the sars-cov-2 spike protein was optimized for binding to human ace2 upon its emergence.

       (reuters/thomas peter) 5) the wuhan institute of virology studies bat coronaviruses and has engaged in ""gain-of-function"" research  the wuhan institute of virology in china studies bat coronaviruses and their potential to infect humans. it has also engaged with so-called ""gain of function"" experiments,  according to the state department , so it was natural to consider whether a bat-related coronavirus outbreak in wuhan came from the lab. ""every informed person, every person in the field of virology, every person in the field of biosafety and biosecurity in january was thinking lab release,"" richard ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at rutgers university, told fox news digital. the wuhan institute of virology is one of at most three places in the world that was conducting gain-of-function research and potential pandemic pathogen enhancement research on sars-related coronaviruses prior to the pandemic, ebright said. the other two are the university of north carolina chapel hill and university of texas medical branch in galveston, he said.  gain-of-function research involves extracting viruses from animals to artificially engineer in a laboratory to make them more transmissible and deadly to humans. the purpose of such research is to allow scientists to get ahead of the curve in developing treatments for certain infectious diseases. but such research is controversial – and was subject to a u.s. funding moratorium in 2014 under the obama administration – over concerns the risks of creating more dangerous pathogens outweighed the benefit to prepare for future outbreaks. the federal funding ban was lifted in 2017 with new guidelines.  house republicans press usaid on $4.7m grant for ecohealth alliance amid covid questions in one example of research, scientists from the wuhan institute of virology and the university of north carolina at chapel hill teamed up for an experiment that created a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus related to the virus that causes sars,  according to a paper  the scientists authored in 2015. the scientists  said in  2015  the work was underway before the ""gain of function"" moratorium began and the u.s. national institutes of health (nih) later determined the research was not so risky as to fall under the ban. the scientists created a chimeric virus, made up of a surface protein of shc014 virus found in horseshoe bats in china and the backbone of a sars virus that had been adapted to grow in mice and to mimic human disease.  ebright  raised alarms about this experiment  at the time and the risk of creating a new lab-made outbreak.  so when news of a covid-19 outbreak in wuhan broke four years later, ebright thought of that risky research in wuhan that was already flagged as a potential pandemic threat. ""this was not merely a possibility,"" ebright said of a lab leak. ""it had been predicted.""

       (fabrice coffrini/afp via getty images) 6) china has not cooperated and investigators have not had full access to the lab, data china has insisted the virus did not come from the lab. and shi zhengli, who leads the wuhan institute of virology research team on bat coronaviruses,  has said  the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus does not match any of the viruses her team had sampled from bat caves in china. but china  has stonewalled an independent investigation , failing to provide complete access or independence to investigators,  withholding data  on the earliest days of the outbreak. the wiv ""has not been transparent"" about its record of studying viruses most similar to the covid-19 virus, including ""ratg13,"" which it sampled from a cave in yunnan province in 2013 after several miners died of sars-like illness,  according to the state department .  the bat virus databases managed by the wuhan institute of virology have  went offline , hidden from scrutiny. meanwhile, the lab’s u.s. partner, ecohealth alliance, has been less than forthcoming about what was going on the wuhan lab,  according to the nih  and congressional investigators. ecohealth alliance has received $117 million in u.s. taxpayer dollars, including a $600,000 nih grant to study the risk of bat coronavirus emergence that was then subgranted to the wuhan lab, according to a house republican aide involved in a congressional investigation on covid-19 origins.  wapo calls for answers on wuhan lab research after calling past questions 'fringe' theories even the washington post editorial board in october called for ecohealth alliance president  peter daszak  to testify before congress about the origins of covid-19, following revelations that, despite  repeated denials , the national institutes of health did fund so-called ""gain of function"" coronavirus research in wuhan through daszak's nonprofit. while china isn’t cooperating, investigators believe that the united states already has insight into the research activities at the wuhan institute of virology through grant-making organizations and ecohealth alliance records, and argue those documents need to be made public.   video 7) lab leaks are not uncommon, so they should not have been dismissed so quickly at the onset of the pandemic researchers working on viruses in laboratories have accidentally gotten infected before and caused virus outbreaks in china and elsewhere. for example, in 2004, a lab-leak sars outbreak in beijing infected nine people, killing the mother of an infected graduate student who worked at china's national institute of virology laboratory. the lab was conducting research on sars coronavirus (sars-cov).   in taiwan in 2003, a scientist at the national defense university in taipei  became  infected  with severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) after studying it in the lab. and a laboratory accident was also to blame for a  sars infection in singapore in 2003  when a doctoral student at the singapore general hospital got sick. state department leaders were warned not to pursue covid origin investigation: former official s ""these viruses are always waiting to infect you,"" quay said of lab research. ""you only have to make a mistake for five minutes after a 20-year career and, you know, you've got it.""   video 8) researchers at the wuhan institute of virology were sick just prior to the community outbreak the state department  revealed in january 2021  that the ""u.s. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the wiv became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses.""  ""this raises questions about the credibility of wiv senior researcher shi zhengli’s public claim that there was ‘zero infection’ among the wiv’s staff and students of sars-cov-2 or sars-related viruses,"" according to the state department report released in the final days of the trump administration.  a u.s. intelligence report  revealed by the wall street journal  in may went into greater detail. it said that three of the researchers from the wuhan institute of virology were sick enough to seek hospital care in november 2019.

""the wiv has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the chinese military since at least 2017,"" the  state department fact sheet states . ""the united states and other donors who funded or collaborated on civilian research at the wiv have a right and obligation to determine whether any of our research funding was diverted to secret chinese military projects at the wiv."" quay, who  testified during a congressional hearing , said the covid-19 virus shows strong signs of academic gain-of-function research and ""hints"" of some never-seen-before features that would be more consistent with ""creating a bioweapon."" ""you cannot draw a conclusion of that magnitude without knowing the minds of the people,"" quay told fox news. ""the difference between academic research and a bioweapon is in the minds of the person in the lab."" regardless, quay believes any lab release was not purposeful. ""there’s abundant evidence that this was an accident.""   video 10) there was an ""orchestrated effort"" by nih officials and others to quickly shut down the lab-leak theory  those who favor the lab-leak theory have been frustrated by leaders at the national institutes of health, including fauci, who pushed the natural origin theory from the early days of the pandemic and repeatedly denied that the federal agency was funding gain-of-function research at the wuhan institute of virology.  newly released documents showed that fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, was warned early on that the virus may have originated in the wuhan lab. on january 31, 2020, dr. kristian andersen, a noted virologist at the scripps lab, privately told fauci that after discussion with his colleagues some of covid-19’s features look possibly engineered and the ""genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory."" in response, fauci hastily organized a call with dozens of worldwide virologists, and notes from the meeting  obtained by fox news’ ""special report""  reveal that suspicions of the lab leak theory were suppressed over concerns of how the public would react to news of possible chinese government involvement.  andersen went on to write a very influential paper with other virologists in nature medicine on march 17, 2020, that said just the opposite of his initial concerns about a lab leak. ""we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" andersen wrote in a widely cited paper that had the effect of establishing a scientific consensus around the natural origin theory. us scientists who downplayed covid-19 lab leak origins theory sang a different tune in private, emails show andersen has stood by the natural origin theory and  explained to the new york times  that he rejected the lab-leak origin theory after getting more information on the virus. he called the change of heart a ""textbook example of the scientific method where a preliminary hypothesis is rejected in favor of a competing hypothesis after more data become available and analyses are completed.""

would the truckers have been satisfied that  their cause was heard  and gone home?  cathedral of the left – dems, biden want to replace rule of law with their brand of religious zealotry after all, these are truck drivers, not thugs. even under the microscope of a censorious press, during those first heady few days, when massive crowds appeared from nowhere to cheer on the drivers, they committed no crimes, no injuries, no looting. there was not a single arrest, much to the disappointment of the liberal media.    video more recently, as police moved in to dismantle the blockade at the ambassador bridge at windsor, almost all the demonstrators peacefully decamped. cnn sounded downright disappointed to report that none went to jail.  the truckers are speaking for millions of working people in canada and around the world who are sick of covid restrictions and increasingly skeptical of the ""science"" behind them. canada’s drivers were set off by a new rule, imposed even as the pandemic crested, that required all truckers entering the country from the u.s. be vaccinated or self-quarantine. the rule seemed unnecessary considering that 85% of the truckers had taken the shot, and that most spend the majority of their time alone.  instead of engaging with the truckers, trudeau ran like a rabbit, only to emerge from hiding to demean the protesters as a ""fringe minority.""   the new mandate also seemed whimsical in that the centers for disease control and prevention and other medical authorities have now proclaimed immunities from surviving covid just as effective against infection as the vaccines. truckers were praised as selfless essential workers as they continued to work through the pandemic, putting themselves in harm’s way. presumably, many got sick and now have antibodies; they may not need the vaccine.  what was trudeau scared of? that the crowd of burly drivers might scoff at his perfectly coiffed hair? not be properly reverent of his literature degree from mcgill university? that the truckers might not respect a lifelong politician whose career rested on the fame of his father?    video instead of engaging with the truckers, trudeau ran like a rabbit, only to emerge from hiding to demean the protesters as a ""fringe minority."" the irony is, of course, that trudeau himself represents a minority, with his liberal party setting a record last fall for the lowest vote share of any party to ever form a government, winning a mere 33% of the popular vote. as in 2019, the conservatives won the popular vote.    trudeau’s response was reprehensible. his unwavering hostility was joined by officials in nova scotia who declared it illegal for people to cheer on the freedom convoy, threatening to impose fines of up to $10,000 for waving the canadian flag. ontario premier doug ford more recently threatened truckers with $100,000 fines and a year in prison. can these politicians hear themselves?  needless to say, faced with such tyrannical overreach, the truckers doubled down. the blockades on crucial u.s.-canada border crossings have caused supply problems and began to shut down manufacturing in both countries.      video the protests may come to the u.s., as we predicted. and joe biden is poised to make exactly the same mistakes as trudeau. already his henchmen in the press have labeled the convoys right-wing extremists – because, you know, they don’t bow to anthony fauci and didn’t attend ivy league schools.   the freedom convoy puts biden in a pickle. when he recently sat down with the chancellor olaf scholz of germany, he celebrated our countries’ shared values, including ""the foundational commitment to the dignity of workers and the need to treat all people with respect."" question for joe: does that include truckers?    video the reality is that biden, like trudeau, is a lifetime pol who has never worked with his hands and has no regard for people who do. he celebrates  labor , writ large, because he is tight with union leaders who fund his campaigns, but workers? not so much.  the international brotherhood of teamsters helped elect biden. their website claims that during the election, they ""made 340,000 phone calls and sent … out 1.3 million pieces of mail and reached more than 350,000 members via digital advertising."" in addition, the teamsters spent over $6 million for democrat-aligned pacs.    video what did they get in return? a white house that ""prioritizes collective bargaining, worker organizing and unions,"" rightly claim the bosses. biden is indeed working to help big labor rebuild their dwindling ranks, all to fund the union bosses’ coffers and raise money for democrats.   click here to get the opinion newsletter biden, in the final days of the campaign, promised teamsters he would have their backs, saying ""we need to protect you, pay you…"" that was then.    video not only will the freedom convoy showcase biden’s phony affection for blue-collar workers, it comes at an awkward time. officials across the country are dropping mask mandates, responding to recent findings that the masking provided little protection and also to polling showing that voters have had enough of the theater and questionable science.  as the new york times reported, numerous polls show ""the desire to return to normalcy has approached or even overtaken alarm about the coronavirus itself."" why not?

   last year,  president joe biden  signed into law the american rescue plan (arp) — a nearly $2 trillion bill sold as a critical boost to a flagging economy, allegedly ""focused on what people need most."" in hindsight, opponents were right about the bill — and the legislators who supported this wasteful and damaging deficit spending should be accountable. when the arp was being debated, critics argued that numerous provisions were poorly crafted and were more likely to worsen the situation than improve it. instead of starting with inexpensive, common-sense reforms that would spur growth and improve pandemic response, the arp was built around a pre-existing partisan wish list with little consideration of the problems at the time. it’s no surprise the results have been disappointing. economists warned that the bill could push  inflation  higher — and inflation has indeed reached its highest level in 40 years. it hasn’t generated the promised millions of new jobs. provisions that were supposed to lead to school reopenings and widely available testing did not deliver. states that were supposedly in desperate need of federal help now report huge federally-subsidized spending increases over the last year. and with more ""excess revenue"" projected in the months ahead, many states are likely to approve more new and wasteful spending. cnbc, cnn sound alarm on inflation: ‘you have to go to 1982 to find a higher number’ where did congress and the white house go wrong? it was a mistake to provide more than $520 billion to states and localities that were already seeing a rebound in tax revenues when the bill was under consideration. a year later, many states are spending historic budget surpluses. instead of refunding it to taxpayers who are still dealing with  coronavirus  concerns, some states regard tax reductions as something they may be ""forced"" into.

   we have dedicated much of our careers to fighting and overturning heavy-handed government mandates. one thing we’ve learned over the years is that when  democrats have power in washington , they typically use it to impose freedom-restricting rules, whether it be on small businesses, family farmers or innovators. but we’ve never seen democrats try to regulate the behavior of toddlers – until now. as parents ourselves, we are outraged that the federal government is using taxpayer money to make children as young as  2 years old have to wear face masks .    video head start facilities provide early education services to low-income children through 1,600 facilities across the country, including in  south dakota  and louisiana. the biden administration is now requiring head start grant recipients to mask toddlers at all times – even if they’re outside on the playground. republicans must remind americans they are the sober alternative to hyper-woke democrats the decision to mask or not mask a toddler should be made by a parent or guardian, not joe biden. not only is this decision to police schoolyard activities yet another affront to parents’ rights by the biden administration, even worse is nothing about this nationwide policy is based on science or common sense. we are heading into the third year of the pandemic, and we know a lot more now than we did in march 2020. young children are less vulnerable to covid-19 than other demographic groups. thankfully, transmission among children is low, and symptoms, if any, are usually mild. that said, we understand some parents or individual head start programs may want to take extra measures to protect their children, including masking themselves or their kids, and they have every right to do so.    video but the federal government should stay out of that decision-making process, especially for americans who are least at risk for the virus but high at risk for being left behind educationally or emotionally. the united states is an outlier in how it treats young people during this pandemic. the world health organization explicitly states that ""children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks … based on the safety and overall interest of the child."" also, the european centre for disease prevention and control doesn’t recommend mask-wearing for children under the age of 12.   video a face mask may be one of the most debilitating learning barriers for young children. the early years are when kids learn to recognize facial cues, understand emotions, and speak and express themselves. prolonged masking directly interferes with a student’s ability to learn verbal and non-verbal communication skills, which can set them back for the rest of their life. click here to get the opinion newsletter thankfully, two federal judges have placed a preliminary injunction on the rule, pending a lawsuit from 25 states, including south dakota and louisiana. but that doesn’t mean we can let the people responsible for this mandate off the hook, nor can we stop this effort until the rule is finally dead.   video if president biden won’t withdraw this harmful requirement, we’ll work to force his hand. republicans will be introducing legislation to nullify this harmful rule that is causing lasting damage to america’s children. through the congressional review act, which gives congress the ability to overturn executive branch rules and regulations, members of congress can either stand with america’s parents who care about their children’s education, or they can side with the union bosses and the biden administration’s flawed playground mask policing rule. it’s a pretty easy choice for us.    click here to get the fox news app we cannot allow big-government socialists to hold back america’s children any more than they already have. children need to be in the classroom. and when there, they should be free to act as kids do – laughing, learning and interacting with friends and teachers unimpeded by a cloth mask that is likely doing very little besides serving as an impediment.  virtue signaling at the expense of our children is the worst kind of political theater. you only get one childhood. for the sake of today’s kids and their futures, democrat politicians should take a real look at the science and have the courage to stand up for the children. click here to read more from sen. john thune click here to read more from rep. steve scalise republican steve scalise is the u.s. house of representatives minority whip. he represents louisiana's 1st congressional district, serving since 2008.   ",2022-02

   the purge has begun. thus far, three branches of the  military  — the  navy ,  air force , and  marine corps  — have discharged more than 650 members due to their objection to the department of defense’s vaccine mandate. the army recently announced it will soon join those branches. kicking out hundreds, possibly thousands, of service members because of their beliefs is not only devastating to troop morale, but also harms our national security interests. general jimmy doolittle, who masterminded the legendary doolittle raid, famously said ""there is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer."" general doolittle was referring to the millions of americans who answered the call to serve after the attack on pearl harbor plunged america into world war ii.  doolittle understood that a military comprised of those who serve because of their love of country is far superior to a conscripted one. biden's ‘woke’ agenda costs military 6 million man-hours, republicans say today, america still has an all-volunteer force. indeed, young patriots continue to be the lifeblood of our military. many cite their religious belief as the primary motivation for joining. but if our nation’s leaders continue to prioritize politics above all else and fulfill their promise to kick out service members because of their beliefs, we run the serious risk of losing that lifeblood.  the message from the pentagon is clear: if you do not get the vaccine, you are unworthy to serve.  the purge that is now underway will hollow out the military, leaving those who were forced to be vaccinated questioning their leaders, and making military service far less attractive to america’s sons and daughters.  the purge that is now underway will hollow out the military, leaving those who were forced to be vaccinated questioning their leaders, and making military service far less attractive to america’s sons and daughters.    the purge’s effects are not just devastating to morale, but we can expect a measurable reduction in readiness that will harm america’s national security. the adage ""freedom isn’t free"" is more accurate than we might realize. according to estimates, it costs approximately $15,000 to successfully recruit one eligible person to join the military.  it then costs another $50,000 to $75,000 to train, equip, and prepare them for service, depending on their assigned duty.  for special forces, such as navy seals, the costs can skyrocket into the millions of dollars per service member.

       (zach gibson/getty images) there are two competing theories of how covid-19 started: naturally or through a lab release. under the natural origin theory, the novel coronavirus, or sars-cov-2, would have originated in an animal and traveled to humans either directly or through an intermediate host  animal .  another theory is that the virus originated from the wuhan institute of virology, which studies bat coronaviruses and has engaged in risky gain-of-function research. the virus could have spread from a researcher accidentally getting infected during an experiment and then unleashing it into the community. scientists  are not in agreement on the origins of the virus, while the u.s. intelligence community also could not draw conclusions on what started the global pandemic that has killed more than 5.8 million people worldwide. fox news special report outlines fresh questions on what fauci, government knew about covid origin knowing the origins could help determine how to prevent future pandemics and also develop public policy to potentially hold china accountable for the global pandemic. and if risky lab research is associated with the creation of the novel coronavirus, then policymakers would have further motivation to regulate or potentially stop federal funding for gain-of-function research and make grantees more accountable.  while china is not cooperating and has denied the lab leak theory, investigators in the u.s. believe they can gain critical information from a new york-based company called ecohealth alliance, which received $117 million in u.s. taxpayer dollars, and has conducted research with the wuhan institute of virology, according to a republican house aide.  u.s. money to ecohealth alliance has come from the national institutes of health (nih), the department of defense, the united states agency for international development (usaid), the national science foundation, the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) and other grant-making agencies.  the big focus has been on an nih award of nearly $600,000 to ecohealth that was then sub-awarded to the wuhan institute of virology during the 2014-2019 period for bat coronavirus research nih acknowledges us funded gain-of-function at wuhan lab, despite fauci’s denials another concern is a  2018 grant proposal  ecohealth alliance president peter daszak sent to the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) for risky  research  on bat coronaviruses with the wuhan institute of virology called project defuse. it called for engineering a  coronavirus  with a ""furin cleavage site"" that would be more infections to and transmissible via humans. the virus would then be released in bat caves where researchers would test the flying mammals with vaccines to see if they could cure the virus. new wuhan covid docs 'completely contradict fauci' on gain-of-function claims, ex-state dept official says darpa denied the request, but critics suggest work continued in some fashion.   republicans in the minority have been  shooting off a series of letters  to nih, ecohealth alliance and the united states agency for international development (usaid) demanding answers on what the u.s. government knows on the type of research u.s. taxpayers were funding indirectly at the wuhan institute of virology. aside from foia results and third-party lawsuits, republicans have been unable to shake loose many responses. a gop committee aide said the government agencies have not been responsive and ecohealth alliance has been stonewalling.

      outside the parliament of canada
       (fox news digital/lisa bennatan) in the 20th century freedom triumphed over both fascism and communism, in the 21th century the greatest threat to that freedom is not from such noxious ideologies, but rather from a permanent state of emergency. the illiberal condition of this state of emergency, which will feel familiar to americans, is one in which the canadian government may now ban public association and protest, seize the bank accounts of their critics, and revoke all manner of other civil liberties. the irony here is that the truckers are protesting emergency rule and trudeau’s hapless answer is to introduce further emergency power. the canadian government promises these new powers are temporary, one almost has to smile at how familiar that sounds.   video i talked to randy hillier, member of ontario’s provincial parliament, who put it this way, ""they’re using the sledgehammer to swat a fly, they're gonna miss the fly, you always do. and they’ll be great harm and collateral damage to everyone else, once again."" as i wandered around parliament hill in ottawa it was hard to disagree with hillier’s assessment. i saw tents where people were making breakfast, trucks in neat rows allowing traffic to pass by them, high-fives and hugs. what i did not see was any conceivable reason to invoke the modern equivalent of canada’s war powers act. sam and his friends were manning one of the food tents as they have been for three weeks now. hearty thick rashers of bacon wafted their elegant aroma down metcalfe street next to the open starbucks. of trudeau he told me, ""he’s not sitting down having a beer with us, he’s dividing the country."" his friend, behind the canadian flag scarf protecting his face from the bitter wind, added, ""it’s a power play.""   video but not everyone in power is on board with this play. on monday three premieres of canadian provinces came out against invoking the emergency act. on tuesday the police chief of ottawa resigned, which protesters i spoke with viewed as a victory. over the past two days there has been some consolidation of the trucks, opening more of the streets in ottawa, though frankly it has not appeared that any traffic has been significantly impeded. that move seemed to be a result of conversations between the mayor and the protesters, and it underscores how effective a simple conversation, rather than emergency powers, can be in this situation. click here to get the opinion newsletter the fact of the matter is that what one sees with one’s own eyes here in the shadow of parliament bears little resemblance to the ""insurrection"" cited by the canadian government and the media it controls. aside from being an example of why state-run news is an atrocious idea, this situation is extremely dangerous. a future in which special powers that curtail the most cherished rights of the people are invoked for fake emergencies is indeed one in which freedom cannot be said to exist. click here to get the fox news app for now, the truckers are not swayed or fearful of these new powers seized by trudeau. if anything, erecting further emergency powers has only strengthened their resolve. maybe the reason trudeau has refused to take the simple step of negotiating to end the supposed crisis is that he doesn’t want the crisis to end. maybe he enjoys the power. if so, it is hard to see how any of this can be resolved. and it is a harbinger of great danger to democracy. click here to read more from david marcus  ",2022-02

   the  omicron wave  that assaulted the united states this winter also bolstered its defenses, leaving enough protection against the coronavirus that future spikes will likely require much less — if any — dramatic disruption to society. millions of individual americans’ immune systems now recognize the  virus  and are primed to fight it off if they encounter omicron, or even another variant. about half of eligible americans have received booster shots , there have been nearly 80 million confirmed infections overall and many more infections have never been reported. one influential model uses those factors and others to estimate that 73% of americans are, for now, immune to omicron, the dominant variant, and that could rise to 80% by mid-march. this will prevent or shorten new illnesses in protected people and reduce the amount of virus circulating overall, likely tamping down new waves. hospitals will get a break from overwhelmed icus, experts agree. cdc, white house anticipating time when covid-19 isn't a crisis as pandemic restrictions loosened ""we have changed,"" said ali mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the university of washington in  seattle . ""we have been exposed to this virus and we know how to deal with it."" the coronavirus — the current variant or  future ones  that are sure to pop up — remains a dangerous germ. it is still infecting more than 130,000 americans and killing more than 2,000 every day. tens of millions of people remain vulnerable. and there will be  future outbreaks . the notion of a ""herd immunity"" that could stop the virus has slipped away under the harsh reality of new variants, waning immunity, and the rejection of vaccines by some americans. but the coronavirus is no longer new. two years ago it arrived in a nation where nobody’s immune system had seen it before. the entire population — 330 million people — were immunologically naive, that is, susceptible to infection.

       (ap photo/ashley landis) ""i am optimistic even if we have a surge in summer, cases will go up, but hospitalizations and deaths will not,"" said mokdad, who works on the institute for health metrics and evaluation model, which calculated the 73% figure for the associated press. with varying degrees of relief and caution, many americans are starting to return to their pre-pandemic lifestyles. sarah rixen, 41, of  bismarck, north dakota , started singing again with a civic chorus after taking a year off. now, with omicron winding down, she said she feels more confident than at any time since the crisis began. ""but i am still a little leery that there could be another variant around the corner,"" said rixen, noting that her family and most of her relatives are fully  vaccinated . ""i am still going to wear a mask."" as  mask mandates  ease, workers return to  offices  and flights fill up, experts are trying to understand whether this return to normal can last, or if another setback is looming. to address that, researchers are trying to answer questions about the virus, the vaccine, and how our bodies respond: how fast is booster protection waning against omicron? how long does protection from  infection  last? how many mild infections were never reported? how many people got infected but had no symptoms? to find clues, they use health data from other countries such as britain, denmark, south africa and qatar to project what could be in store. who reports new covid-19 cases drop by 19% globally scientists  at johns hopkins university bloomberg school of public health estimate that about three out of four people in the united states will have been infected by  omicron  by the end of the surge. ""we know it’s a huge proportion of the population,"" said shaun truelove, an epidemiologist and disease modeler at johns hopkins. ""this varies a lot by location, and in some areas we expect the number infected to be closer to one in two."" that means different regions or groups of people have different level of protection — and risk. in  virginia , disease modelers are thinking about their population in terms of groups with different levels of immunity. they estimate about 45% of virginians have the highest level of immunity through boosted vaccination or through vaccination plus a recent infection with omicron. another 47% have immunity that has waned somewhat; and 7% are the most vulnerable because they were never vaccinated and never infected. in all, the vast majority of virginians have at least some immunity, said bryan lewis, a computational epidemiologist who leads university of virginia’s covid-19 modeling team.   video ""that’s going to be a nice shield of armor for our population as a whole,"" lewis said. ""if we do get to very low case rates, we certainly can ease back on some of these restrictions."" still, while the population is better protected, many individuals are not. even by the most optimistic estimates for population immunity, 80 million or so americans are still vulnerable. that’s about the same as the total number of confirmed infections in the u.s. during the pandemic. ""the 26% who could still get omicron right now have to be very careful,"" mokdad said. andrew pekosz, a virus researcher at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health, is concerned that people — particularly unvaccinated omicron survivors — may have a false sense of security. ""in an ideal world, unvaccinated individuals infected with omicron would be lining up for a vaccine shot,"" he said. click here to get the fox news app also, estimating protection is far from an exact science. it’s a moving target, as immunity wanes and new variants circulate. protection varies widely from person to person. and it’s impossible to know for sure how many people are protected at all. the ihme model estimates a wide range — from 63% to 81% of americans. ""we’ve reached a much better position for the coming months, but with waning immunity we shouldn’t take it for granted,"" mokdad said.  ",2022-02

   there is a familiar dynamic to government protests that is normally as regular as clockwork. protesters will exaggerate the size and scope of their actions, while the government will attempt to downplay it. that was how the trucker convoy in  ottawa, canada ’s capital, began 3 weeks ago.  prime minister justin trudeau mocked the protesters as a small, fringe element. but as the protest continues, both sides now have an interest in making what is happening seem bigger than it truly is. david marcus: why trudeau's ‘temporary’ state of emergency is a dangerous sign     
      canada's prime minister justin trudeau arrives to a news conference on parliament hill in ottawa, ontario, canada february 14, 2022. reuters/blair gable
       part of the issue here is that huge trucks take up a lot, and i mean, a lot of space. aside from weekends when wellington street in front of parliament becomes a fairly large dance party, there are rarely more than one or two hundred protesters in what trudeau calls the ""occupation"" of ottawa. two hundred freezing and friendly people does not an occupation make. even if the big rigs make it seem so. at the beginning of this week it appeared that rational voices on both sides might have been reaching a conclusion to the ""crisis."" across canada, covid restrictions were being relaxed, the mayor of ottawa was meeting with the truckers, and the latter’s footprint in the city was being consolidated and reduced. but that was before justin trudeau decided to go nuclear.   video prior to trudeau’s absurd and dangerous invocation of canada’s emergency act the end game seemed clear. restrictions would continue to fall as the convoy reduced its size and both sides would declare a victory. the truckers for forcing the government’s hand, the government for ending the protest. now that possibility has become deeply complicated. aside from the trucks lining the streets in a limited area of ottawa there is another sight worth mentioning. the stores nearby are mainly closed, but tellingly, none are boarded up. last year during left wing protests in toronto, stores boarded up as they had in 2020 in the united states. this wasn’t a government order in either case. it was a precaution taken by the businesses themselves, that has not happened in ottawa because there is no threat.   video it’s an important giveaway, one that strongly suggests trudeau and his government have intentionally overplayed the danger presented by the truckers. the government claims ottawans are being harassed. the only example i saw of that was a well-dressed woman walking by a group of protesters who yelled, ""it’s not a protest, it’s an occupation!"" over and over. it felt exactly like people screaming at those not wearing masks. an under noted but important aspect of all of this is that to the extent the area impacted is residential – it is very high end. the zoom class professionals who live there don’t seem to like lowly truckers on their streets.   video the problem with easing tensions now, calming both the truckers and the well-to-do professionals who live in the tony district near parliament, is in fact the emergency act. what was likely before, and is generally how protests end, is that most of the truckers and their allies would disperse leaving a hard core group willing to be arrested for their stance. but today, instead of being arrested for some minor protesting charge, the truckers are looking at up to five years in prison and losing their livelihood. even far-flung supporters who gave small donations are in trudeau’s crosshairs. for the leaders of the convoy, their potential arrests may no longer be symbolic. click here to get the opinion newsletter trudeau has backed the truckers into a corner, leading some to opine that he is courting catastrophe for political gain, though it's hard to see that he is gaining much of anything as his opponents drown him out in parliament while his allies sit on their hands. maybe he is just bad at this, maybe his actions are more nefarious. there seem to be two main options as to how this can end now. one is mass arrests and removal of the trucks. on wednesday, ottawa police handed out fliers promising just such a thing. the other option is that the protest eventually withers along with the covid restrictions in canada. click here to get the fox news app those truly in favor of peace and safety should pray for a light touch from the government, but ominous signs portend that will not be the case. so far, there has been nothing that can truly be called an emergency in ottawa, but trudeau’s unprecedented emergency act may change that. there is still time for a calm settlement of the situation, but the clock, as they say, is ticking. click here to read more from david marcus  ",2022-02

   the  covid-19 pandemic  has hit women hard. at women’s march, where i serve as executive director, we know this firsthand. we feel it in our own lives. we see and hear it from our millions of members in all 50 states.  women in america are not all right. and the  politicians  tasked with making our lives better,  on both sides of the aisle,  all too often only make things worse – ignoring us, lying to us, or speaking for us instead of simply helping.    video our organization has talked at length about the ways republican officials have hurt women recently: rejecting paid family and medical leave, blocking minimum wage increases, and quashing access to reproductive health care, to name just a few. (not to mention the  undermining-trust-in-our-vaccines  and attempting-to-overturn-our-elections things…) we’ll keep talking, writing, marching and even running for office until we get the change we need. why a lawsuit over forced masking of our children in virginia is necessary but at women’s march, our fight isn’t red versus blue. it’s a fight  for  the 51% of our population being left behind by leaders who lack political courage and refuse to do their jobs. and here, democrats are guilty, too.  in some instances, they haven’t fought hard enough to keep their promises. in other instances, though, democrats have fought too hard (and for too long) for the wrong things – and women have suffered the consequences.  school closures are one example.      
      a ""closed"" sign in front of a public elementary school in grand rapids, michigan, in march 2020.
       (istock) when the pandemic first hit, we literally didn’t know better. after all, children and young adults were among the hardest hit during the last pandemic, the 1918 spanish flu. when we didn’t know if covid-19 would act similarly, closing schools made sense. it was the right decision.  but just a few months in, we knew this wasn’t the case. by june 2020, the american academy of pediatrics was already advocating for a return to safe, in-person school ,  noting that the benefits for kids – academic, physical and mental – outweighed the risks. and that was  before  vaccines were even developed, much less widely and freely available. still, many democratic cities and states kept schools closed for another year. and during more recent covid spikes, too many have been too quick to shut them down again.  from mental health to math scores to simply eating a good meal, school closures failed the kids they were supposed to protect.   this isn’t to discount staffing shortages, especially this january, that left some schools with no choice other than to temporarily close doors. and it isn’t to blame teachers, who are mostly women, who’ve done god’s work during the pandemic, and whose concerns for themselves and their students are real.  still, the impact on children – particularly the most disadvantaged – has been devastating. from mental health to math scores to simply eating a good meal, school closures failed the kids they were supposed to protect. it’s true that black and latino parents were most hesitant to send their children back to school, for very real current and historic reasons. but every family should have had a choice – and every school should have been given necessary resources to open safely. (what actually happened: schools in communities hit hardest by covid often had the  fewest  resources to combat it.)   video no wonder moms exited – or, really, were ejected from – the workforce in droves over the past two years. in september 2020 and 2021, a combined 1,172,000 women left their jobs. it’s no coincidence these mass-career-casualties coincided with the start of school years, when virtual learning was either status quo or used regularly as a backup.  then there are the women who could never afford to stop working – especially outside the home. for millions who couldn’t go remote, especially the essential workers we hailed as heroes, school closures didn’t mean worrying about kids wandering into the background of zoom meetings. they meant leaving a 6-year-old home alone, hoping she wouldn’t burn the apartment down trying to make herself grilled cheese for lunch. or they meant bringing that 6-year-old to work so she could access wi-fi from taco bell’s parking lot.    video today, it’s clear as daylight. while closing schools isn’t always a mistake, the politicians who promoted and perpetuated school closures, especially recently, were by and large mistaken. fortunately, with the omicron surge subsiding, most kids are back in classrooms. and many women – though not all – are back at work. so why bring this up now? why not just move on? because women’s march doesn’t pledge allegiance to any political party or its elites – even one that claims to fight for working families and communities of color. our allegiance is to women. and women,  especially  from working families and communities of color, have suffered the brunt of the past two years and the school closures they’ve normalized.  click here to get the opinion newsletter it’s important to say so – loudly and clearly. after all, if we’re not honest when leaders harm us, if we don’t have the courage to tell them they’re wrong, we’re all but asking them to do it again.  and school closures are a mistake we can’t afford to repeat.  click here to get the fox news app  ",2022-02

   this past weekend, the  super bowl  enlightened us not just because the bengals tragically lost in the last minute of the big game, but because we saw a false pretense, a façade of virtuous character among our leaders and lawmakers insisting we mask up. but yet they don’t conform to their own social and moral standards. leaders lead by setting an example for others. but when that doesn’t happen, we lose trust, respect, and credibility – while simultaneously forcing children to cover their faces all day long in  school,  which at this point is harmful to our kids. viral video shows children rejoicing after learning they no longer need to mask up in school is it really that bad? yes. at this time, masking children is more harmful than  covid  itself for most children, the lowest risk group who have a near-zero mortality rate from coronavirus – 0.24% to be exact.   video when children cover their faces, they cover their personalities, their expressions. facial expressions are the most vital and valuable aspect of human to human communication and interaction - the way a child conveys his thoughts, emotions, ideas, intentions. their face indicates physical or psychological distress and that’s not to mention nonverbal communication expressing fear, anger sadness, or pain, all of which impacts social engagement, growth, personality, confidence, and behavior. it makes me wonder whether alterations or deprivation of these necessities at an early age will be responsible for  mental illness  later in life. children aren't as good at recognizing masked faces as adults, study finds covering a child’s face is closing the window to a child’s mental and physical state, dampening their personality, cognitive processes and hindering their emotions and enculturation. in the words of psychologist silvan tomkins, ""the face is the seat of emotion."" and whether a child expresses excitement or anguish, it must be acknowledged, but this is not possible with the only eyes exposed due to mask coverage of 80% of a child’s face.  we cannot wear masks in perpetuity.   i’ve had patients come in with worsening speech impediments, rashes and infections on the face, eye infections from fiddling with their masks and touching their eyes and nose. the  world health organization  does not recommend masking for children under age 5 and only optional for those ages 6 to 11. this begs the question as to why the u.s. guidance is outdated and obsolete, especially at a time when hospitalizations and cases have plummeted by over 80%. yet we have not updated our policy and guidelines to reflect such even though we’ve achieved our goals, accomplished our mission. we ""flattened the curve,"" but protocols have not been appropriately modified.   video click here to get the opinion newsletter there is no solid concrete data that indicates significant benefit to masking a toddler. i see firsthand the detrimental impact it has on our children. the burden of protection is placed on our children, the least vulnerable and lowest risk population. this defies truth, it defies logic, it defies science. the backward protocol needs to be lifted. current policies are obsolete and must be modified accordingly. we cannot wear masks in perpetuity. it should be an option, a choice for anyone. covid is no longer an emergency. we have come to a point in time where cases are gone: in my last shift wednesday night, of all my sick patients, i only had one positive case. i can tell you firsthand from the front lines we are in a reprieve. i don’t know how long it will last, but holding up an umbrella outside when there’s no rain and only sunshine makes no sense. click here to get the fox news app let’s not forget we have a 94% seroprevalence in the united states. that means most americans have either had a vaccine or have natural immunity from previous infection. also, we now have antivirals meds to treat covid. we have monoclonal antibodies, we finally have enough tests, and thanks to operation warp speed, we have life-saving vaccines. time to move on.  click here to read more from dr. janette nesheiwat  ",2022-02

       (mike dunn) the native of springfield,  missouri,  chatted with fox news digital before getting out on the road again this year after covid-19 interrupted a busy touring schedule.  how busy, one might ask? in 2019, dallas wayne did 110 gigs. in 2020, because of  lockdowns  and restrictions, he was able to do just  three .  prior to ""coldwater, tennessee,"" wayne's most recent album was ""songs the jukebox taught me, volume 2,"" which came out in june 2018 on the heart of texas records label.  throughout his career, dallas wayne has done commercial voiceovers for tv and radio, including for  united airlines, delta airlines , oldsmobile,  chevrolet,  ford, suzuki,  mcdonald's , nintendo, miller brewing co., old el paso and avis rental cars. he's also a broadcaster on sirius xm’s willie’s roadhouse channel.  in an interview, wayne shared a selection of life lessons and observations. fox news digital:  you've toured all across the country and much of the world. what stands out in your mind about people you've encountered along the way?  dallas wayne:  people are pretty much the same. they want to raise their  families , they want to be safe and secure in their homes, they want to have a roof over their heads, and they want to have a future. those things are universal. as soon as we realize that people are all the same, all over the world — that people basically have the same wants, needs and desires — the sooner we'll get along with everybody. and get an understanding of folks. fox news digital:  share an unusual encounter or two you might've had in your career over the years. wayne:  there have been a lot, of course — some funny ones, too.  one night i was playing in switzerland, and a lady came up to me with a bouquet of flowers. she brought them up to the stage and handed them up to me, and i said, ""oh, thank you. they smell wonderful!""  and she said, ""they’re plastic, you idiot!""  i didn’t know quite what to say after that [laughing] — and i was right in the middle of a song. those kinds of interactions are interesting. another time, the father of one of my longtime radio listeners had gone into  hospice . and she had on the willie’s roadhouse channel 24/7 for him — the channel i work for on sirius xm.  it was her dad's favorite channel, and i was kind of getting reports [about the listener's dad] throughout the day. she told me he would smile when i played this song or that song. being right there in the middle of a situation like that, even though it was remote — that meant a lot.  you have to treat those kinds of situations with a certain amount of importance. music is a universal language to people. music means things to people.  don mclean: ‘i did the right thing with my life’ it’s important to people, no matter what genre it is.  i’ve played all over the world, thankfully, and i've never had any problems communicating with people musically. the only times i've ever had issues communicating around the globe was when i've been in restaurants trying to order supper!

       (grand ole opry) fox news digital:  in this new year of 2022, how much is your schedule opening up again? wayne:  i’m getting out more this year as things have gotten a little better. [the pandemic has] been a blow to everybody in the touring business, not just the artists themselves but the musicians, crew members and others. it’s been tough for them to survive over the last couple of years. some artists have changed the work they do, and some have announced they’re not going to tour anymore. they spent the last year-and-a-half at home and realized how much they missed their families and how much they loved it.  tony robbins gets real about success in life and health: 'just thinking positive is b.s.' the one silver lining — if there has been one through all of covid — is that it's given people a chance to reassess and take stock of their world.  usually we’re so busy all the time. then, suddenly, we’re not.  for me, i was able to relocate from austin, texas, to bristol, tennessee. for a year i worked on this 130-year-old house that we bought.  and i've finally gotten all the boxes unpacked, every single box. usually, when i move, i'd take stuff through three or four moves, and i'd finally open up the boxes. this time, we were able to get settled into a new place and a new way of life.     
      a native of missouri, dallas wayne is a singer, songwriter, radio dj, voiceover artist, actor and music producer. he began performing professionally while in school; in nashville, he developed his vocal style. his second single from the new album comes out march 25; it's called ""he even brought her flowers"" and it's a duet with country singer-songwriter bill anderson. 
       (george brainard) fox news digital:  tell us about bristol, tennessee: had you been wanting to move there for some time? wayne:  we fell in love with the area a long time ago. that’s where [my wife jo and i] spent our honeymoon, near gatlinburg, which is a big honeymoon spot for hillbillies like myself!  and we’ve always liked the area. we love the climate and the people, and the scenery is just stunning. new york man biking across america reveals ‘random acts of kindness’ in arkansas fox news digital:  you've now had the chance, you've said, to go back into the studio and record original music.  wayne:  my last two projects were basically cover albums, ""songs the jukebox taught me,"" volumes 1 and 2 [released in 2016 and 2018, respectively]. this period of time has given me the opportunity to sit down and think about an all-original album, and really take the time to do it right.  it's hard, when a person is wearing a lot of hats, to really have the time to focus on just that. so i'm grateful. john rich on the gift from his dad that meant the most fox news digital:  what's on your bucket list for the year ahead? wayne:  it may be a new normal, and that’s fine — at this point i’ll take any kind of normal it can be. but i'm looking forward to getting out and playing for people in concert again.

       (david kawai/bloomberg) what do you do next? how do you make this moment last forever? there's only one way. you must find a new emergency that justifies making your powers permanent. if you're going to remain god, you're going to need the devil to fight. so, if you're wondering why so many western leaders suddenly are vilifying their own populations, people they were supposed to represent, this is why. find an enemy, create a crisis, stay in power forever. it's the oldest recipe for tyranny that there is. if we don't recognize it in our own age, it's only because nothing like this was supposed to happen in a democracy, but it is happening, most clearly in  canada .   last week, justin trudeau used a peaceful trucker strike to declare martial law. trudeau seized control of the police. he shut down opposition media coverage. he declared himself the final arbiter of all financial transactions in the nation of canada. these are dictatorial powers, but they were necessary, trudeau explained, because this was an emergency. white supremacist and other sedition-minded forces, backed by foreign saboteurs (sound familiar?) threatened the very existence of  canada . the truckers were effectively an invading army.   canadian trucker beaten by police says he won't be intimidated: ‘they broke my body, but not my spirit’ well, over the weekend,  trudeau  defeated that army. they were unarmed. he is not. trudeau cleared the trucker strike by force. yet his emergency powers remain. today, justin trudeau explained that he will remain in full control of canada indefinitely. and that's essential, he said, to keep canada safe, but the video tells a very different story. in fact, it's trudeau's crackdown on human rights that has put canadians in danger. trudeau's forces told one woman she's no longer allowed to record what happens in her own city.   woman: i just want to get a coffee, ok?  police: why is the camera in my face right now? ...right now you are in the red zone.  woman: i’m scared, i want to go for a coffee down there.  police: where are you from?   woman: alberta.   police: we’ve been patrolling all day, if we see you again it will be different.   other police officer (grabbing a hold of the camera): leave. take your camera and get out of here.   woman: i’m walking away.   other police officer: do you understand that?   woman: i’m walking away...  other police officer: walk away. your phone doesn’t need to be in our faces when you’re walking away.   woman: i’m walking away.  rand paul denounces trudeau’s ‘dangerous’ emergencies act, warns of similar us laws     ""i just want a cup of coffee.""  ""get out of here.""  multiply what you just saw by an entire country, and that's canada tonight. there's no longer any pretext that this is about the covid pandemic. no one in trudeau's government is trying to protect canadians from anything much less a virus. this is political repression.   if you doubt that, consider what happened to a place called the ionic cafe. that's a coffee shop in downtown ottawa. on sunday, riot police tried to break into the cafe and shut it down. why? because the proprietors had dared to serve coffee to the truckers during the protest. under justin trudeau, that is now a crime. a man called enrico, who works at the cafe, said he saw trudeau's forces mistreat a civilian on the sidewalk, possibly like the mistreatment you just saw. when he told them to back off, ""hey, this is canada,"" they turned on him.   man filming: ok, share this out, you guys, get it out everywhere now. get it out. they're saying they're going to break the window. they already walked around back, you guys. here's your tax service. here's your taxes at play, everyone. welcome to absolute tyranny.   so that kind of thing is happening all over the capital city of canada. the virus is in retreat, but there's a new crisis and that crisis is disobedience. last week we showed you the footage of trudeau's forces trampling a woman with horses. now, internal texts show the officers who rode those horses celebrated what they did.   ""just watch that horse video. that is awesome,"" said one officer.  awesome. an elderly woman being trampled by a horse. the canadian government has confirmed that those texts are real but none of the supposedly progressive politicians in canada care in the least. no one on the canadian left or the american left, for that matter, has condemned any of this or any other grotesque violation of human rights in canada. state media aren't even reporting that it's happening. but it is happening. over the weekend, the show obtained footage of a particularly brutal beating in ottawa during the crackdown. when you watch it, you can see a man being kneed repeatedly by trudeau's men. david paisley: i can hear noises of people getting shoved around outside, being arrested, a man being kneed there. that's terrible.     video kneeing him, again and again, and again. he wasn't resisting. and the man who shot that footage was called david paisley. he runs a website called shedmedia.ca. police have arrested paisley and seized the camera equipment he used to shoot that— $5,000 worth. now we thought that video was remarkable, so we alerted several canadian media outlets over the weekend, including cbc and ctv to this footage. we gave them david paisley's contact information, news organization to news organization. but none of them reported on it. so we looked into it ourselves.   several protesters who were there said that a trucker in an orange jacket called csaba vizi was attacked by police officers during the crackdown. we reached csaba vizi and he confirmed it and provided footage. it shows him exiting his cab calmly, kneeling down in front of his truck and clasping his hands behind his head.  ottawa police called ‘tyrants,’ ‘criminals’ after threatening freedom convoy truckers   csaba vizi, trucker: i’m proud you’re here   unidentified man: (speaks french)   csaba vizi, trucker: i don’t speak french.  unidentified man: it’s very hard, but, you don’t lose.   csaba vizi, trucker: no, i am not.   unident i fied man:  second battle.   csaba vizi, trucker: as soon as they let me out, i’ll be back. … i’m going down. i’m going down by knee, hands behind my back. i am self-ready... i’m peacefully protesting.   so the man surrenders, on camera, and then he's kneed repeatedly into submission. now we'd love to have more footage, but it turns out none of justin trudeau's men was wearing a body camera at the time. that's pretty weird. no one in canadian state media cares to follow up on that story, and so they're not. they don't care, either.  the brutality is just one element of this crackdown. on saturday, ottawa's new police chief promised to hunt down the regime's enemies no matter where they are in coming months and ruin them financially.  ottawa police chief: so, i will stand here today again and say this demonstration is over. go home. if you don't go home, we will remove you from the streets. … if you are involved in this protest, we will actively look to identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges. absolutely.   if you were involved in a protest, you'll be sanctioned and charged. what does that mean exactly? well, last night, justin trudeau's government announced that it's also going after anyone who ""directly or indirectly participated in the protests."" according to mark strahl, who is a member of canada's parliament, the dragnet has ensnared one of his constituents. it's a woman called briane. her crime? donating $50 to the truckers. in response ""her bank account has now been frozen."" briane is a single mom from chilliwack, working a minimum wage job. she now has no money at all. so under trudeau's new order, she won't simply lose access to her bank account. she will also lose access to credit unions, co-ops, trusts and loan providers.     video this is what the collapse of democracy looks like. it's not simply beating people in the streets. it's making it impossible for them to live because you steal all their money. you award yourself the power to control every dollar in your country. where's that power come from? well, it's a self-appointed power, that justin trudeau now has, and you prevent anyone from speaking out against you. so trudeau is not just targeting people who parked their trucks in ottawa, he's crushing anyone who supports them. he's going after their employers. over the weekend, the owner of a trucking company in ontario received this threatening call from trudeau's authorities.  caller: well, my job is to, um, to phone the registered owner of the trucks to ask them if they're still in ottawa and if they are still in ottawa, i wish to tell the registered owner that now they can be subject to the new measures under the emergency measures act, so they can like seize assets and freeze bank accounts and all that kind of stuff.   so, trudeau's government is promising to seize company assets and zero up bank accounts because one company truck parked on the street in ottawa. it's not simply an overreaction, a grotesque overreaction to a peaceful protest. it's a wild and unprecedented expansion of powers that is permanent, and that make democracy impossible. canada's finance minister explained that trudeau is not going to give up this power. ever.   wapo editorial board supports federal no-fly list for passengers who don’t obey mask mandates on flight     canadian finance minister:  we will be putting forward measures to put those tools permanently in place. the authorities of fintrac, i believe, do need to be expanded to cover crowdsourcing platforms and payment platform and their payment providers. so that's... something that we need to do and we will do and that needs to be in place permanently.   you'll notice that some of the harshest authoritarians, not simply in canada, but across the west, speak in light, lilting voices going up on the last syllable. they don't sound like mussolini, but they've awarded themselves greater powers. by the way, this all seems to have happened overnight in canada, but that's simply because most americans don't pay attention.   a year ago, canada's government began debating something called c-36. that bill would allow activists to head to court and accuse someone of ""contemplating hate speech""—not even saying something unauthorized, just thinking about saying it. so, what is hate speech exactly and what does it look like to contemplate it? well, back around 2020, a man living in british columbia wrote to complain to a canadian government official called bob rae. the man wrote that ""you and your government have blood on your hands for not quarantining canada's borders before we’d imported covid from around the world.""  click here to get the fox news app

""vladimir putin is the tyrant,"" they tell us, ""not justin trudeau."" at this point it's pretty clear that if you want to know the future they are planning for us in the united states, look north to canada.   this article is adapted from tucker carlson's opening monologue on the february 21, 2022 edition of ""tucker carlson tonight.""   ",2022-02

""that has not changed and it will not change. under the current guidelines, masks may be removed indoors while eating and drinking. while we did not see perfect adoption of the guidelines in every instance over the weekend, we were encouraged overall by the level of masking and vigilance we saw on the parade route and at ball events."" the louisiana supreme court last week denied requests for a temporary restraining order and an expedited hearing on a lawsuit challenging cantrell's mask mandate and the  vaccine  mandate, which requires people older than 5 to show proof of vaccination in order to enter most businesses. more than 100 plaintiffs have sued the mayor, the new orleans health department, and that agency’s leader dr. jennifer avegno, saying the mandates are violating their constitutional rights.

   the washington post editorial board expressed support on monday for a federal no-fly-list that would include passengers who flout mask mandates during their flight. the editorial board published an op-ed titled ""grandstanding republican senators try to protect unruly passengers,"" which focussed on the republican opposition to a national no-fly-list that seeks to bar disruptive passengers from future flights. the registry, which has long been reserved for perceived terrorists, would expand to include unruly passengers, including those who prove themselves unwilling to abide by the federal mask mandate for air travel. flight attendants' union pushes for no-fly-list for unruly passengers while gop senators vehemently oppose the idea of a national registry that equates mask flouters to terrorists, the editorial board thinks it's a ""no-brainer"" to address the mounting confrontations triggered by the pandemic.

""if it did, there’s a good chance many americans would applaud if one were a rule barring violent, unruly and disruptive airline passengers from the skies."" "" applause  has been exactly the reaction on some planes when aggressive passengers were removed following moments of onboard mayhem, often related to mask mandate…nonetheless, some republicans in washington are grandstanding, rejecting no-nonsense measures to keep passengers and crews safe on airlines,"" the editorial board continues.  california man who forced plane to divert to kansas city allegedly said ‘we’re going to bring down the plane' the column references a recent letter sent to attorney general merrick garland by 8 gop senators who voiced their opposition to the effort.

      the center for disease control and prevention (cdc) has been criticized and mocked from all sides after a series of muddled messages have baffled americans amid a record surge in covid-19 cases and the spread of the omicron variant. (istock)
       (istock) but this week, one times reporter picked up on what many of us have been saying about the cdc’s deception. the reporter learned that the cdc data on booster efficacy released two weeks ago conveniently left out hospitalization data for people under age 50. so, let’s trace the origin of the widespread employer and college booster mandates for young people. there never was, and still is, zero scientific, clinical data that boosting reduces covid hospitalizations in young healthy people. the fda had bypassed its expert advisory group to authorize boosters in young people after its own experts previously voted 16-2 against the idea and two top fda officials quit over white house pressure over this very issue.   video throughout the saga, the media gave public health leaders a megaphone to broadcast their agenda, unchecked, failing to ask them any basic questions. like, where’s the supporting data? colleges and universities, which pride themselves as bastions of intelligent inquisition, embarrassed themselves by blindly following the scientific dogma, requiring all vaccinated students to get boosted, even when many already had natural immunity. so, do public health officials understand why people don’t trust them? hiding data on boosters in young people is only one piece of the political shell game the cdc plays. there more than 150 studies supporting natural immunity, including a jama study recently published by my hopkins team. moreover, the observational clinical data are clear—natural immunity reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation and death in healthy people to nearly zero.   video but despite this overwhelming body of scientific evidence that has withstood the test of time, the cdc has consistently cited two studies to the contrary, both highly flawed studies it published itself. one of those studies is a cdc study using a 2-month sliver of kentucky data. despite having data on all 50 states, the cdc only reported data from that one state last year. the obvious explanation is that it was the only state and time period that gave the cdc the results it wanted. why else would it not report the same data from any of the other 49 states? moreover, in its jury-rigged study, the rate of infection in each group was less than 0.01 percent. regardless, the cdc study vigorously concluded that vaccinated immunity was 2.3-times better than natural immunity, based on a very small difference in the sample which was likely attributable to other factors. dr. and cdc director rochelle walensky used it to propagate the notion that those who had covid still must get vaccinated.   video last month, new york and california released data to the cdc that natural immunity was 2.8 times more effective in preventing hospitalizations than vaccinated immunity—a benefit that was the same for those with hybrid (natural and vaccinated) immunity. but absent from its reversal was any apology to the many american workers with natural immunity it insisted be fired from their job for not being vaccinated unvaccinated. ironically, when employers fired those with natural immunity for not being vaccinated, they fired those least likely to spread the infection or get hospitalized. similarly, the cdc put out two highly flawed studies that promoted mask mandates, detailed by dr. vinay prasad.  click here to get the opinion newsletter the american people are just hungry for honesty.  they want the data straight, not politically curated by a small group of like-minded scientists. if i were advising president joe biden, i would tell him that the cdc needs to restore the public trust by making all cdc data available in real-time for researchers around the country to access and to study. it’s time we end secret data laboratories in the government. click here to get the fox news app the cdc has a pattern of hoarding data in order to cherry-pick the findings it likes and then publish them in its own journal, called mmwr. this is not how a respectable country should function during a pandemic. an optimal response to a national health emergency should warrant more data transparency, not less. click here to read more from dr. marty makary  ",2022-02

   a more  infectious  type of the  omicron variant  has surged to account for more than a third of global covid-19 cases sequenced recently, adding to the debate about whether countries are ready for full reopening. health  authorities are examining whether the subvariant of omicron, known as ba.2, could extend the length of covid-19 waves that have peaked recently in europe, japan and some other places. ""we’re looking not only at how quickly those peaks go up, but how they come down,""  world health organization  epidemiologist maria van kerkhove  said . ""and as the decline in cases occurs…we also need to look at: is there a slowing of that decline? or will we start to see an increase again?"" cdc director: studies yet to show ba.2 sub-variant evading current vaccines more than omicron ba.2 accounted for only 3.9% of covid-19 infections in the u.s. in the week through feb. 12, according to the most recent estimate released by the centers for disease control and prevention. after an omicron surge in december 2021, the u.s. has experienced an equally  sharp and steady fall . other countries have had more trouble shrugging off omicron. in denmark, where an estimated 92% of cases were ba.2 as of mid-february, a peak at the end of january was followed by another two weeks later. evidence so far suggests  ba.2 is some 30% more infectious  than its cousin, the ba.1 subvariant that kicked off the omicron wave in southern africa in november 2021. in south africa, ba.2 has accounted for 82% of cases so far in february, according to health authorities in that country.

       (fabrice coffrini/pool via reuters) overall, ba.2 accounted for 35% of covid-19 virus samples whose genomes were recently submitted to the global gisaid database, according to a gisaid update released tuesday. studies so far suggest that both types of omicron pose about the same risk of severe disease in humans. that risk is lower than last year’s delta variant, but with so many people getting infected, the death toll from omicron is still high. a south african analysis  comparing a group with likely ba.1 omicron against another group with likely ba.2 found both groups had roughly equal odds of being hospitalized and developing severe disease. early studies suggest that vaccines and booster shots work equally well in both omicron types in preventing serious illness.  a study by the u.k. health security agency  found both types could easily get around the immunity of people who had received their full primary course of  vaccination  at least six months earlier. but a booster shot restored protection against symptomatic disease from both variants, to 69% for ba.1 and 74% for ba.2. who tracking 4 omicron sub-variants, says preventing all covid transmissions 'not the goal' still, some initial research in test tubes and animals leaves room for concern that ba.2 might be more harmful. a team led by kei sato at the university of tokyo found that ba.2 had an easier time  invading the cells in the lungs of hamsters  compared with ba.1. prof. sato said ba.2 has as many differences from ba.1 as last year’s delta variant had from the original virus detected in wuhan, china. he said ba.2 might merit its own greek-letter name rather than being classed as a type of omicron. new york university virologist nathaniel landau has led  research  suggesting that omicron ba.2 is even better than ba.1 at evading  monoclonal antibody drugs  developed to fight covid-19. nonetheless, he said a new greek letter wouldn’t be needed unless ba.2 turned out to be more harmful to humans. ""if it were to turn out that it has higher pathogenicity, that would then be a reason. but at this point, no,"" he said.   video prof. sato said the current co-circulation of ba.1 and ba.2 could spawn a hybrid  virus  that would ""more easily increase and be more harmful."" scientists said the public-health measures to deal with omicron were generally the same regardless of its type—vaccination, booster shots, social distancing, masks, good ventilation and so on. the question is whether the spread of the even more infectious omicron type should affect the loosening of restrictions. denmark lifted all restrictions on feb. 1, only to see a rise in deaths in people infected with covid-19. officials said the virus wasn’t the cause of some of the deaths. click here to get the fox news app who officials said the threat of ba.2 was a reason for caution. in japan, where ba.2 has recently been detected, the head of the country’s doctors association, toshio nakagawa, said the country should keep restrictions such as encouraging restaurants to close early.

   more than half of u.s.  abortions  are now done with  pills  rather than  surgery , an upward trend that spiked during the  pandemic  with the increase in  telemedicine , a report released thursday shows. in 2020, pills accounted for 54% of all u.s. abortions, up from roughly 44% in 2019. colombia legalizes abortion up to 24 weeks the preliminary numbers come from the guttmacher institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. the group, by contacting providers, collects more comprehensive abortion data than the u.s. government. use of abortion pills has been rising since 2000 when the food and drug administration approved mifepristone — the main drug used in medication abortions. the new increase ""is not surprising, especially during covid,""  said dr. marji gold , a family medicine physician and abortion provider in new york city. she said patients seeking abortions at her  clinic  have long chosen the pills over the medical procedure.

       (ap photo/jeff roberson) the pandemic prompted a rise in telemedicine and fda action that allowed abortion pills to be mailed so patients could skip in-person visits to get them. those changes could have contributed to the increase in use, said guttmacher researcher rachel jones. the fda made the change permanent last december, meaning millions of women can get a prescription via an online consultation and receive the pills through the mail. that move led to stepped-up efforts by abortion opponents to seek additional restrictions on medication abortions through state legislatures. appeals court rules in biden's favor on abortion referrals the procedure includes mifepristone, which blocks a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue, followed one or two days later by misoprostol, a drug that causes cramping that empties the womb. the combination is approved for use within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, although some health care providers offer it in the second trimester, a practice called off-label use. so far this year, 16 state legislatures have proposed bans or restrictions on medication abortion, according to the guttmacher report. it notes that in 32 states, medication abortions must be prescribed by physicians even though other health care providers including physician assistants can prescribe other medicines. and mailing abortion pills to patients is banned in three states — arizona, arkansas and texas, the report says.   video according to the  world health organization , about 73 million abortions are performed each year. about 630,000 abortions were reported to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention in 2019 although information from some states is missing. guttmacher’s last comprehensive abortion report dates to 2017; the data provided thursday comes from an update due out later this year. click here to get the fox news app global numbers on rates of medication versus surgical abortions are limited. data from england and wales show that medication abortions have outpaced surgical abortions for about 10 years.

   young people  between the ages of 12-20 have reported several cases of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome, otherwise known as mis-c, where the immune system goes on overdrive after being vaccinated for covid-19, according to a recent lancet  report .  the report noted  mis-c  is a rare condition that can happen two to six weeks after covid-19 infection with patients complaining of fever and showing signs and symptoms of multi-organ involvement with systemic inflammation.  ""patients with mis-c usually present with persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions and, in severe cases, with hypotension and shock,"" the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) said on their  website .

       the agency added the illness ""may begin weeks after a child is infected with sars-cov-2. the child may have been infected from an asymptomatic contact and, in some cases, the child and their caregivers may not even know they had been  infected .""  first recognized in april 2020, 5973 cases were reported to the cdc between may 2020 to november 2021, with the study’s authors hypothesizing the illness develops because of a hyperactive immune response to covid-19  infection  in susceptible patients who have a genetic predisposition for the syndrome.  explaining war to kids as russia invades ukraine: what to say and how to say it but the study investigated if the syndrome also occurred after covid-19 vaccination.      
      a team of researchers from mount sinai claimed to have discovered an ""important clue"" behind a rare, potentially serious coronavirus-related inflammatory illness in children, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or mis-c. 
       (istock) the study analyzed the cdc’s vaccine adverse event reporting system for potential cases of mis-c after covid-19  vaccination  from dec. 14, 2020, to aug. 31, 2021, in individuals aged 12─20 years, identifying 21 young people, with a mean age of 16 years old, who met the cdc’s definition of the inflammatory condition.  the researchers noted all of these patients were hospitalized, 57% were admitted directly to the intensive care unit, with 71% with laboratory evidence of past or recent covid-19 infection, but all were discharged home.  even though six young people in the study didn’t have evidence of a prior  covid-19  infection, the researchers hypothesized because the lab assays have limited sensitivity for asymptomatic infections, the young participants might have been infected with covid-19 even though they tested negative, so ""vaccination might be coincidental to the subsequent mis-c  illness .""  over 21 million individuals ages 12-20 years old received one or more doses of covid-19 vaccine as of august 31, 2021, so the overall reporting rate for mis-c after vaccination is 1 case per million people compared to a rate of 0.3 cases per million vaccinated individuals among those without prior laboratory evidence of covid-19, per the study.   these rates are ""substantially lower than the previously published incidence of mis-c among unvaccinated individuals in this age group in the usa who had sars-cov-2 infection (approximately 200 cases per million sars-cov-2 infections),"" the researchers  said .  cdc: pediatric er visits skyrocket for injuries and eating disorders during the pandemic although the report seems concerning, most of the cases in the study were not considered fully vaccinated, so unvaccinated young people are still more likely to develop mis-c than those who are fully vaccinated, according to a today  report .   ""at first glance, it seems to cause us to step back and say, ‘wait a minute, are these vaccines contributing to mis-c?’"" said dr. jim versalovic, pathologist-in-chief and covid-19 command center co-leader at texas children’s  hospital .   ""it does the opposite for me. it emphasizes the point of vaccination.""  the study found 11 young people developed mis-c after their first vaccination dose with eight days as median time from first being vaccinated to hospitalization compared to 10 individuals who developed the systemic illness after receiving their second dose and five days as the median time from first being vaccinated to getting hospitalized.       
      an expert says amputations relating to mis-c are an ""incredibly rare and unfortunate consequence.""
       (photo courtesy of mary free bed rehabilitation hospital) the study has limitations including underestimating rates of all mis-c cases among those who received the covid-19 vaccine because the data was analyzed by passive reporting systems and because the researchers relied only on reports with final diagnoses that noted mis-c since there is no definitive test to diagnose the condition.   experts urge parents to get their teenagers vaccinated as only 57% of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated, according to the  cdc .  the researchers concluded the contribution of the covid-19 vaccine to mis-c is unknown, so they encouraged health care providers to rule out other causes when evaluating individuals with a clinical presentation consistent with the systemic syndrome.  ""continued surveillance for mis-c illness after covid-19 vaccination is warranted, especially as pediatric covid-19 vaccination is authorized and recommended for younger children who comprise the highest proportion of mis-c cases after sars-cov-2 infection,"" the researchers said.    click here to get the fox news app click  here  for more information for parents about the syndrome.   ",2022-02

   for two years,  hong kong  successfully insulated most of its residents from  covid-19  and often went months without a single locally spread case. then the  omicron  variant showed up. the fast-spreading mutation breached hong kong’s defenses and has been spreading rapidly through one of the world’s most densely populated places, overflowing hospitals and isolation wards and prompting measures to test the entire population of 7.4 million and hastily build six isolation and treatment centers. the  surge  shows what happens when covid-19 strikes a population unprotected by immunity from previous  infections  and has exposed a low  vaccination  rate among elderly citizens who are bearing the brunt of the crisis. only about 30% of hong kong residents over the age of 80 and around 58% of those in their 70s are fully vaccinated, lagging younger populations by a large margin. this is despite the fact that vaccines have been widely available in hong kong since early 2021. hong kong orders mandatory covid-19 tests for all residents the city has reported about 150 deaths in the past three days, many among the unvaccinated elderly. health authorities said vaccine reluctance among the elderly is an unfortunate side effect of hong kong’s success in warding off the  virus  for months. many thought the risk of getting covid-19 was virtually zero since there were no cases, and senior citizens were led to believe that the risk of vaccination was greater than not getting vaccinated, said karen grépin, a public health expert at the university of hong kong. hundreds of millions of jabs have been given to people around the world, and few serious risks have been identified after intense safety monitoring. but early reports of a few adverse reactions to the vaccine in hong kong created a false perception that people needed to be perfectly healthy to get vaccinated.

       (ap photo/kin cheung) ""hong kong is the world’s guinea pig when it comes to omicron,"" said grépin. the hong kong experience may also hold lessons for mainland  china  and its decision on when to reopen its borders and eliminate a two- to three-week quarantine requirement for anybody entering the country. only a small proportion of the population has been infected, thanks to the communist party’s strict zero-covid approach of mass testing and lockdowns. the hong kong government’s response has been to ramp up a zero-covid approach similar to the mainland. chinese officials have urged hong kong to stick to the approach, despite  grumbling  from residents, with even leader  xi jinping  weighing in to make sure the message got through. under the zero covid-19 policy, everyone who tests positive in hong kong must be isolated. while this worked in the past, hong kong, unlike the mainland, does not have the beds to isolate so many people in a large outbreak. construction teams from the mainland are rushing to build two permanent and four temporary isolation and treatment centers to handle more than 20,000 patients. it's an effort reminiscent of the early days of the virus when china hastily constructed two temporary hospitals in the city of wuhan in a matter of days. cdc loosens covid-19 indoor mask guidance, including for schools authorities also  launched  a vaccine pass on thursday, requiring vaccination to enter shopping malls and other premises, and it is driving some to get the shot. ""if i don’t get vaccinated, i can’t even go to  restaurants ,"" said 73-year-old yu mui as she lined up for her first dose friday. ""so i have to come here today even though i am worried about the side effects."" scientists  believe the omicron variant is milder than the delta version of the virus. but hong kong’s situation is unique. in other nations where the omicron variant spread, people had immunity from vaccines or previous infections, and this blunted the severity of the disease. with many people unvaccinated and vulnerable, michal head, a global health expert at university of southampton, fears that it may have a ""worryingly high burden of severe covid-19 in coming weeks"". ""omicron has been described by some as ‘mild’. but it’s certainly still severe enough to have a high mortality rate, far higher than flu or other similar respiratory infections,"" he warned.

""but now it gets worse, and so i decided to come and get vaccinated,"" she said. ""it protects not only myself but also my family members."" and hong kong has announced it will test everyone in the city next month, taking another page from the mainland playbook. china has sent in experts and others to put up temporary labs to handle the volume of tests. but benjamin cowling, who studies epidemics at hong kong university, advised against mass testing in march since it would be hard to deal with the sheer number of confirmed cases that the approach would throw up. instead, he suggested using the nimbler, rapid tests to alert people to isolate at home if they were infected and had mild symptoms. click here to get the fox news app the ultra-contagious nature of the omicron variant means that unless you have incredibly stringent lockdown measures, mask wearing and social distancing norms, you’re not going to stem the spread, said dr. jimmy whitworth, an infectious diseases expert at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. even china is battling multiple outbreaks, though they are much smaller than hong kong’s. china on saturday reported 249 new cases in the mainland, of which 156 were among people who had arrived from overseas. hong kong, by comparison, reported more than 17,000 new cases in the latest 24-hour period and 66 deaths. whitworth said that hong kong’s priority right now should be to encourage vaccination. ""that is by far and away, the most important message. and particularly targeting the elderly,"" he said.   ",2022-02

   why aren’t more of us challenging the  centers for disease control’s (cdc)  masking recommendations for children? despite changes in indoor masking requirements that have liberated most adults, the cdc continues to cling to unscientific covid-19 guidelines that harm our children by keeping them masked for no good reason. in many school districts, parents have been stripped of the authority to opt-out on behalf of their children because their school officials adhere to the cdc guidelines religiously. it is time for us to take a closer look at the cdc and its decision to keep our children in masks.  despite minuscule evidence of benefits and increasing evidence of harms—physical, mental and emotional—the cdc refuses to veer from its recommendation that children ages 2 and up should be masked indoors regardless of vaccination status. that’s also how we get the ridiculous airline guidance: ""all passengers 2 years and older must wear a face mask for the duration of the flight, including during boarding and deplaning with no medical exceptions allowed."" don’t blame the airlines (at least for the rules). blame the cdc. omicron variant: is it leading us closer to herd immunity against covid-19? in addition to the heartbreaking anecdotal evidence revealing that our kids are not ok, we have government reports and medical surveys documenting our children’s flagging mental and emotional conditions. and now there’s emerging evidence that masking practices stunted our children’s development. for example, with masked adults and peers, how can children learn to discern the nonverbal modes of communication that come from reading the faces of those they encounter? the children harmed the most are from families with limited resources. all this is occurring despite the fact that children are at low risk of being affected by or dying from  covid-19 ; some evidence even suggests that children present a lower risk for spreading the disease, too.

   even as the  omicron  wave recedes and americans look to return to normal, we can see ripple effects from the pandemic that will be with us for years. in some cases, the long-term impacts of the pandemic mean we won’t ""return to normal"" at all. in the realm of our children’s education, we have the opportunity to make some shifts that will improve  education  outcomes both for students and our country. for example, when learning shifted from schools to homes, parents had a view into their children’s education with unprecedented clarity. parents now know not only what their kids are learning, but also what they’re  not  learning. when it comes to preparing students to be successful in college, in their careers, or in their roles as informed citizens, we’re failing terribly– the u.s. remains in 13th place globally when it comes to quality education. virginia parents frustrated some schools are still forcing masks on kids for years, business leaders and parents have questioned whether students were graduating from high school with the skills needed to succeed in college and beyond. the questions surrounding this skill gap have not been around hard skills or content knowledge, but rather durable soft skills. many employers are struggling to find stand-out entry-level candidates due to their lack of soft skills, and this is still a major hurdle for recruiters today, especially as they screen candidates coming out of the pandemic. here’s the rub: the skills most sought after by scholarship selection committees, university admissions offices and employers are rarely directly taught in schools. in a  recent study , seven out of 10 most requested job skills in job postings were durable soft skills - and leadership and communication were the highest in-demand competencies. the study argues that ""the long-term success of our economy, our country’s competitive advantage, and our  national security  requires improving educational outcomes.""

""several prominent researchers have speculated that language development among children could be hindered with the loss of facial cues,"" they wrote.

   education experts analyzed the apparent changes of heart left-leaning media and  democratic leaders  have undergone on  covid-19   mask mandates  and concluded many are acting on ""political"" science, as opposed to actual science.  democratic governors such as new jersey's phil murphy, new york's kathy hochul, connecticut's ned lamont, and delaware's john carney have all announced the rollback of mask mandates in their states as coronavirus cases decline. fight for schools executive director and america first legal senior adviser ian prior argued it's a positive sign that mask mandates are being eased despite the reasoning, but stopped short of giving full credit to the democrats enacting those changes. ny gov. hochul says mask mandate for schools to end march 2 amid declining covid cases ""i think when you look at some of the changes that are coming out of states that have democrat governors, what they are looking at is the polling data, the political science, not the science,"" prior told fox news digital at the 2022 conservative political action conference. ""but look, if they're going to get rid of mask mandates, and if they're going to be pressured by those things, well then that's great.""

""no, this is a cynical, political play because they realize they've been losing this debate for years, and if they do not want to have, ultimately, what could be an epic republican majority coming in 2022, then they have to moderate their message. and i'm not sure it's going to work because you have so many people on the far left that have captured the democrat party that … having them now change their tune, i think people see through that."" national director of research at the american federation for children corey deangelis used the same phrase to describe democrats' loosening of mask restrictions. ""they're following the political science,"" deangelis told fox news digital. ""the underperformance of democrats in november likely served as a wake-up call for politicians embracing restrictions. polling likely nudged these politicians towards relaxing mandates. but whether the rollback is because of a genuine change of heart or due to political pressure, the result is the same: families have more freedom to choose. at the same time, choosing whether your child wears a mask at school is an extremely low bar when it comes to parental rights in education.""

   during  president joe biden ’s first state of the union address, he may choose to declare victory over  covid-19 . for sure, case rates, hospitalizations, and deaths from covid have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, and we should give the biden administration credit for utilizing president donald trump’s successful development of safe and effective vaccines to vaccinate close to 70 percent of all eligible americans. as covid-19 cases, hospitalizations fall, states consider revising restrictions

(photo by drew angerer/getty images)
       the appropriate question to pose at this juncture, however, is at what cost has victory been won? when one examines biden’s ""victory"" in detail, to include the tally of covid cases and fatalities, its impact on the disruption of primary and secondary education for a generation of our youth, skyrocketing drug overdose deaths and related behavioral health issues, and inflation and deficits now at the highest levels in decades, it is, indeed, hard to ""distinguish it from defeat."" if the biden team’s covid response strategy had achieved any identifiable positive outcomes for all of this ruin, then admiration may be in order.  but it did not. here are some of the details: covid-19 cases and fatalities increased significantly. during the biden administration’s close to 400 days leading america’s covid-19 response, the u.s. experienced over 135,000 covid-19 cases, and over 1325 covid-19 deaths, per day. these numbers represent twice the number of cases, and 20 percent more deaths, per day than we experienced during the year in which the trump administration was in charge of the nation’s covid response. this outcome is all the more perplexing given the advantage of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and knowledge of the virus granted to the biden team when it took office.   video learning loss has been significant. in july of 2021, my former colleagues at mckinsey & company released a report after having analyzed data from curriculum associates, which had assessed covid-related learning loss among 1.6 million students in more than 40 states. the results were grim: in one year’s time, students on average fell behind by five months in math and four months in reading. moreover, this learning loss was more pronounced in minority students. in a more recent study released by nwea in december of 2021 assessing over 6 million students, declines in achievement seemed to accelerate and ranged from 3-7 percentile points (~10 percent) in reading and 9-11 percentile points (~20 percent) in math. again, these declines were more pronounced in minorities.   video drug overdoses skyrocketed, while overall mental health deteriorated. the center for disease control and prevention (cdc) tracks drug overdose deaths each year starting in july and ending the following june. in 2019, it reported just under 69,000 drug overdose deaths in the united states. in 2021, this figure had jumped to just over 101,000 deaths, or a 47 percent increase. while we may not be able attribute this entire increase to covid, the 2-year period between 2019-2021 coinciding with the advent and spread of covid represented the cdc’s largest ever recorded increase in overdose deaths, and the increase between 2020-2021 was significantly larger than the increase from 2019-2020. beyond the increase in overdose deaths, the american psychological association noted in reviewing the national center for health statistics data in november 2021 that the prevalence of anxiety and depression among american adults had both jumped by 200-300% over their 2019 levels.   video covid-induced inflation and deficits soared. in late march of 2021, during an interview on bloomberg’s wall street week, larry summers, president obama’s treasury secretary, referred to president biden’s american rescue plan act (arpa) as ""the least responsible macroeconomic policy we’ve had in 40 years."" he predicted it would lead to higher inflation and indeed it did. when one looks at the debt-financed distribution of arpa’s $1.9 trillion, no one should be surprised. only nine percent of it went to fighting covid, while the majority of it was used to either subsidize those out of the workforce or to help many financially irresponsible states narrow their budget gaps. by igniting a rate of 7.5 percent year-on-year inflation, 330 million americans are now feeling the pain of biden’s covid-related policies.   video the devastating impact of covid, regardless of who was president, would have been tragic. but there is growing evidence that the biden administration’s response strategy exacerbated the pandemic’s educational, emotional, and economic devastation without mitigating covid cases and fatalities.  click here to get the opinion newsletter in the fall of 2020, the trump administration was adopting a strategy which focused on protecting those most vulnerable to covid while letting our economy, schools, and the daily lives of americans carry on normally. the biden folks adopted an alternative strategy focused on bans, mandates, shutdowns, and the complete eradication of the virus at any cost. that cost has been astronomical, and the virus has been anything but eradicated. click here to get the fox news app pyrrhus, the third century bc greek military

   nearly half of the 500 million free  covid-19 tests  the  biden administration  recently made available to the public still have not been claimed as  virus  cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test. wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic, from  vaccines  to hand sanitizer, along with tests. on the first day of the  white house  test giveaway in january,  covidtests.gov  received over 45 million orders. now officials say fewer than 100,000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household, delivered by the u.s. postal service. still, the white house sees the program as a step toward a deeper, yet more elastic, testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane. ""we totally intend to sustain this market,"" dr. tom inglesby, testing adviser to the covid-19 response team,  told the associated press . ""we know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants."" the white house says americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests, which leaves about 46% of the stock of tests still available to be ordered. white house dropping mask mandate before biden state of the union: official testing will become more important with  mask requirements now easing , say some independent experts. ""if  infection  control is still our priority, testing is central,"" said dr. leana wen, a former baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic. ""four tests per household for one family will only last you one time. there should be enough tests for families to test twice a week."" inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that. private  insurers  are now required to cover eight free rapid tests per person, per month. medicare coverage will start in the spring. the administration has also been making free at-home tests available through libraries, clinics and other community venues. capacity for the more accurate pcr tests performed by labs has been built up. the white house recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year. wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often. ""right now it is still unclear,"" she said.

       (ap photo/rich pedroncelli, file) president joe biden’s pivot to testing came under duress  as the omicron variant gained force just before christmas. tests were frustratingly hard to come by, and expensive. the white house is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late. ""there is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected,"" said tim manning, supply coordinator for the covid-19 response team. around mid-december, with omicron projections grimmer by the day, white house officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one. but if the government started siphoning up tests on the market, that would just make the shortage worse. ""a critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public,"" manning said. the white house enlisted the pentagon and parts of the health and human services department that had worked on the  trump administration’s  vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines. logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests. the postal service was designated to take the orders and deliver them. hong kong orders mandatory covid-19 tests for all residents that part proved to be a good call, said hana schank, an expert on government technology projects with the new america think-tank. the postal service already had a database of every address in the land, and the means to deliver. ""at the federal level the only people who have a database connected to a fulfillment engine would be the post office,"" she said. the project took less than a month to get ready, manning said. ""we said this is not online retail,"" he said. ""this is emergency response, so we have go to as fast as possible."" to make sure it wasn’t just the  tech  savvy who would end up getting free tests, the administration targeted a share of deliveries to people in low-income areas. the white house worked with service organizations to get the word out.   video ""we prioritized the processing of orders to the highest social vulnerability zip codes in the country,"" testing adviser inglesby said. one of the service groups was the national association of community health workers, whose members help people navigate the health care system. executive director denise smith said the group was able to use its website to link more than 630,000 people to covidtests.gov. overall about 20% to 25% of the tests have gone to people in distressed areas, officials said. now that demand is way down, it’s unclear what will happen to the white house giveaway program. allowing repeat orders is one possibility. click here to get the fox news app smith says groups like hers should get any surplus. ""we know where the people are,"" she said. although the program is still in its infancy, analyst lindsey dawson of the kaiser family foundation believes its legacy may lie in familiarizing more people with testing. ""it may get someone comfortable with utilizing the tests, thinking about how they might use testing in their lives,"" she said. savita sharaf, a retiree from the maryland suburbs outside the nation’s capital, said she ordered her free tests around the middle of january and got them in early february. she’s tried to conserve them, for added peace of mind. in the stores, she couldn’t find tests for less than $25. ""i’m so relieved because i can immediately test myself,"" sharaf said. ""if we had a high vaccination rate, it would be a little easier to say let up on this program. but i feel we have to watch for the next month or two, to see what happens.""  ",2022-03

""what changed in the science yesterday, monday, as opposed to a week ago monday?"" asked hemmer.  ""it wasn’t actually yesterday, bill. what the cdc did is they put out guidance last friday that identified recommendations depending on what the hospitalization rates are in your part of the country,"" responded psaki.   white house dropping mask mandate before biden state of the union: official psaki referenced  updated guidance  from the centers for disease control (cdc) which drastically eased its recommendations for mask-wearing across the country. according to the new guidance, americans who are in an area of ""low"" or ""medium"" risk for covid-19 transmission do not need to wear masks. this model means that over 70% of americans can now go maskless. this includes  washington d.c.,  where an indoor mask mandate from  mayor muriel bowser  expired tuesday. ""the recommendation is not to wear masks, so we’re not wearing masks in the white house, the president’s not going to wear a mask tonight. but it’s different depending on the part of the country,"" added psaki. democrats ripped for dropping mask mandates based on ‘political science’   video the biden administration and democrat-led states  have come under criticism  from those who argue loosening covid restrictions has been based more on  political calculations  than science. the white house’s decision comes less than 24 hours before biden’s state of the union address. in a follow-up question, psaki was asked how the president can convince americans that he has helped to improve their lives over the past year. a february  fox news poll  found only 18% said biden’s actions on inflation are helping the country. 44% said his actions were hurting. psaki noted that the state of the union is a ""huge opportunity"" for biden, who will spend much of his time discussing the conflict in  ukraine  as well as his efforts to ""lead the world"" in standing up to autocratic leaders and the ""horrific"" actions of  vladimir putin.

       (ap) children have suffered a great deal from the pandemic lockdowns and have not been made a priority to regain normalcy as information evolved.  at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic many restrictions, such as mask-wearing in schools, were quickly enforced through desperation to slow the transmission despite negligible data proving benefit. but there were a lot of unknowns during this time so an all-hands-on deck effort could be justified. however, by summer 2021 enough data emerged demonstrating cloth masks predominately had no perceptible benefit, and the low risk of severe covid in children became apparent. yet, no updates were made by the cdc regarding mask-wearing in schools. in fact, despite vaccines being readily available for everyone five years and older, it doubled down on its school masking recommendations as the less severe omicron variant became dominant. schools are not documented places of high-risk exposure for kids yet too many have been kept home through remote learning because of closures, having close contact exposure, and various other reasons. when in-person, they still have been distanced from others with faces remained covered, and they were discouraged from physically interacting with one another. this has remained despite data from as early as november 2020 from the cdc, uk, and other countries showing low risk of in-school transmission. while the u.s. is the only country to recommend children two years and older wear masks, other countries with less stringent mask recommendations began removing school mask requirements more than eight months ago without a sharp uptick in hospitalizations as a result. the cdc’s latest estimate through january 2022 show nearly 60 percent of kids have been exposed to sars-cov-2. given the high level of transmissibility with omicron, this number is much higher as we enter march 2022. through vaccine and natural immunity, upward of 90 percent of kids likely have some level of immunity at this point. while vaccine and natural immunity have proven less capable of preventing future infections, their ability to lessen severe illness remain intact – similar to the flu shot.   video without any immunity, a child’s risk of severe illness falls much lower than during the preceding six flu seasons, a fact that has been evident since late 2020 as reported in bmj journal by switzerland scientists. even natural immunity has become politicized to the detriment of our kids. the large siren study looked at more than 30,000 participants and showed those who recovered from covid-19 had a statistically significant lower risk of reinfection up to seven months (the length of the trial) after their first infection. this paper was published april 2021, yet the cdc neglected its findings while moving forward with universal vaccine and booster mandates segregating the population unnecessarily.  regardless of political affiliation, as it stands today, there is no denying the overwhelming data demonstrate covid poses little risk to children, there is no proven benefit to kids wearing cloth masks, and natural immunity from sars-cov-2 offers protection from severe future covid illness.   video these are the facts. the science hasn’t miraculously changed in the last few months, but the situation has evolved as more people have become infected and been vaccinated.  there is a myriad of risks that our children face every day. parenting is about balancing risks while allowing our kids to live life to the fullest. the pandemic is fluid. as it morphs into an endemic pathogen with seasonal upticks, parents must shun the groupthink mentality that disallows actions and opinions to change as the situation morphs. our public health leaders and policymakers should have led the charge to dissipate fear rather than invoke a perpetual state of panic neglecting data along the way.   video there will never be a time when removal of face masks will be universally welcomed just as our children will never live a day with zero risk to their well-being. the emotional safety net for people who were calling for vaccines to be available before removing masks should have been pulled when school age children were eligible to be vaccinated last fall. click here to get the opinion newsletter now, the cdc says people are tired, so they are recommending removal of masks to

   orlando, fla. –  in his speech to the  2022 cpac  in orange county, fla., over the weekend, former cia analyst and radio host  buck sexton  called for a ""housecleaning of the bureaucracy"" within the federal government, including health care establishment that imposed draconian rules and restrictions on americans during the coronavirus pandemic. sexton  sat down with  fox news digital  at cpac for a wide-ranging interview and expounded upon the points he made in his speech. ""the rapid fading of the covid apparatus and the withdrawal from the constant appearances in the news cycle by the labcoat tyrant fauci is a direct function of politics,"" said sexton, explaining that niaid director  dr. anthony fauci  was used as a ""weapon' within the federal bureaucracy – first against president trump and later against any civilian dissidents of the biden administration and its policies on that front.     
      msnbc's nicolle wallace has referred to herself as a mask-loving ""fauci groupie,"" in reference to her adoration of white house chief medical adviser dr. anthony fauci.
       sexton called the left's mitigation measures ""unscientific"" and said state governors who refused to impose such mandates ended up experiencing similar or better medical statistics than those who did. northeastern governors like pennsylvania's  tom wolf , new jersey's  phil murphy , delaware's  john carney , north carolina's roy cooper and west coast governors like california's gavin newsom and oregon's kate brown led the way in imposing forceful and often complex mandates – such as limiting hours of alcohol consumption at taverns  in one case  -- under threat of fines or other punishments. south dakota's kristi noem, florida's ron desantis and texas' greg abbott were seen as governors whose states ultimately fared similarly against covid in the long term, but unlike many democrats, did not impose restrictions on their citizens. ""i'm very proud to be one of the earliest outspoken conservatives against all of these measures, recognizing that they had never worked before and there was no scientific basis other than argument and then the suppression of arguments from the other side to believe that they would work now,"" sexton said. tucker confronts nj gov over covid mandates: ‘i wasn’t thinking of the bill of rights when we did this'     
      new jersey gov. philip j. murphy and pennsylvania gov. thomas w. wolf, both democrats, instituted sweeping covid mandates throughout 2020-21.
       ""this is driven by the political cycle. but then again, i argue, or i would argue that so were vaccine mandates. so were all of the different mask mandates. we've seen so much of what was pushed for covid started out in the minds of the bureaucrats as something that might be worth trying. … and then it became an issue of political and tribal allegiance."" many times, once authorities decided on a new mandate, the data on its effectiveness was often ignored, he added, pointing to states where there were no mask mandates. with the interview taking place prior to president biden's state of the union tuesday, sexton correctly predicted the white house would claim ""some kind of win"" after his fellow democrats in control of congress lifted the mask mandate in time for the nationally-televised address. ""i would argue that the numbers speak for themselves – more dead under biden from covid in the same period of time than in the initial stages of the pandemic without a vaccine from trump. they cannot change those numbers,"" he said.  ""they cannot change the perception here. biden on covid could not be a bigger failure."" sexton called or fauci – one of the highest-paid bureaucrats who has worked at the nih in bethesda, md., since 1968 – to be both ""repudiated professionally"" and investigated by congress if republicans are successful in taking back power later this year. prior to the state of the union, many democratic governors like murphy, carney and connecticut's ned lamont walked back their covid-era restrictions. as sexton previously noted on ""the clay travis and buck sexton show,"" lamont drew criticism for claiming connecticut residents have ""earned this freedom"". at cpac, sexton said he will work hard to make sure the american people do not forget over the next eight months what fauci and the democrats did to them, their families, and their occupations: ""i view it as my mission in life between now and election day to remind as many americans as possible,"" sexton told fox news digital.  sexton: ‘labcoat tyrant’ fauci feeling pressure as beagle flies scandal intensifies

""my esteemed co-host clay [travis], and i, can have a real impact –  i view it as my mission in life to remind the american people that the democrat party on its own and against all common sense, data, and just basic human dignity, decided to mask, and i would argue, abuse children in schools for months and months beyond any reasonable interpretation of the data."" ""i view it as my mission in life to remind everyone who will listen that the democrats drew circles in parks and told people, 'if you sit in this circle, you're more safe outside from the virus.'"" ""it's my mission to remind everybody that there were little footpads in elevators and on escalators telling people to stand six feet apart. and then it was three feet, and then it was 20 feet. and then, 'oh gosh, we don't even know if this distancing thing did anything' -- and of course it didn't."" later in the interview, sexton discussed the canadian trucker convoy protesting vaccine mandates and government overreach, the response by liberal prime minister justin trudeau, and the way american truckers have been recently inspired to make their own voices heard in washington. last week, a trucker from biden's hometown of scranton organized a convoy that traveled down interstates 81 and 83 toward baltimore and washington to encircle the capitol beltway ""like a boa constrictor."" since then, a transcontinental convoy set out from california to potentially enter the district of columbia itself. sexton said that it remains to be seen how the california convoy will comport itself in terms of protest. however, as the left-wing protests that often turned violent in 2020 showed, there have been many times democrats in power have used protests ""as a weapon against those who disagree on entirely political lines."" ""so, a protest, or even a riot, that has a left-wing agenda attached to it is to be treated as a free-speech exercise even when it's dangerous and burning down buildings and attacking law enforcement officers,"" he said. ""and conservative protest is either shut down on phony covid, ‘no mass gatherings’ grounds or, in this case, the claims that we saw in canada about it being some neo-nazi white nationalist, domestic terrorist threat – that was just the worst kind of lies."" click to get the fox news app

       (photo by mohamed kadri/nurphoto via getty images  |  adrian wyld/the canadian press/bloomberg via getty images) comparing canadian and american trucker protests, sexton said that because government overreach and mandates north of the border were present in a much more nationwide context than the u.s. – where many red states in middle america weren't under the same draconian orders as on the coasts – it could affect the populist ""momentum"" of the protests here. ""i think it's very different here because a lot of people live in states that have not been subjected to the same degree of madness,"" he said. ""it might be harder to get the same kind of momentum as they saw in canada, where it was really nationwide fauciism,"" he added. ""but if they are peaceful, and they are about freedom and individual liberty… then i would stand with them and hope that everyone watches closely to see when the biden administration is willing to call out men with truncheons and tell them to bludgeon people and when they're not. i think the politics drive that.""

""at the beginning of this, if you remember, it was all about following the science. and then somewhere along the lines, we stopped talking about science. me being in a business that was without a doubt arbitrarily selected to be mitigated from the standpoint of whether or not we’re wearing a mask, or whether or not we’re showing [vaccine] cards.""  outrage as dc closes the big board restaurant over vaccine mandate: ‘draconian covid measures’

""he gave them bad public health information,"" she said. ""if that were my kid there, i don't know what i would do … i don't know if it would be legal. it's just so inappropriate to see that from a leader. i would go nuts."" ‘ saturday night live’ pokes fun at masking, coronavirus theatrics a skit on the nbc comedy show last week showed three sets of couples nervously admitting out loud that perhaps the rhetoric over shifting science, dining regulations, and arbitrary mask rules was nonsense all along. after one character brings up an article that potentially mask mandates had no effect on the virus, the eaters become anxious and start to question conventional wisdom on vaccinations and masks. ""look, i went to a child’s birthday party, self-careful,"" says a woman played by kate mckinnon, ""and they did gymnastics in masks ... and then they went into another room and took off their masks to eat pizza — this is the end of me — so did they really need the mask or no? did any of us ever need the mask?"" a similar skit in 2018 mocked liberal anxieties over discussing the possible pitfalls of the #metoo movement. msnbc host declares one month before biden went maskless at state of the union that it's ‘gaslighting’ to say people don't want mask mandates a defiant mehdi hasan defended a tweet last month calling for keeping mask mandates in schools and expanding the supreme court, and cited a survey that showed a majority of americans still wanted indoor mask mandates.

   people infected with covid-19 are at risk of having a cardiovascular disease-related incident 30 days after having been infected by the virus, researchers showed in a recent report in the journal  nature medicine.   the report found those with covid-19 are potentially susceptible to developing 20 different heart and vascular diseases including among others: heart failure, pericarditis, myocarditis, stroke, cerebrovascular disorders, and dysrhythmias. even individuals who were not hospitalized with the infection were found to have developed more cardiovascular disease than those who were never infected, the study said.  ""there were 20 cardiac disorders that were diagnosed for those patients that are suffering from long haul covid. the most common is the shortness of breath and fatigue,"" dr. evelina grayver, md, the director of women’s  heart health  program at northwell health in ny told fox news.

""in regards to long-haul covid and cardio symptoms it has been an array of anything from significant shortness of breath to palpitations to simply an inability to complete a workout,"" grayver told fox news.  dr. grayver told fox news, that many patients who suffer  cardiovascular effects  of long covid-19 like myocarditis are afraid to exercise but said exercise can play an important role in recovery, including her own after contracting covid-19.  ""unfortunately, because i suffered from the same diagnosis for a while, i understand it too well. if the heart function has completely recovered, it is a matter of trying to push yourself a little bit at a time every single day. people with history of myocarditis and with the fear of exercise should take part in a cardiac rehab program,"" grayver said in the interview. the cardiologist told fox that many centers have opened up to enable people, who are recovering from  covid-19 , to exercise in a controlled environment. ""when patients are able to start their exercise regimen in a controlled environment, where they are being closely monitored in regards to their ekg, blood pressure and heart rate, they feel a lot more comfortable and safer to continue with their exercise outside of the cardiac rehab centers,"" grayver told fox news.

""especially when you target certain type of exercise that deals with high intensity interval training. that not only changes your heart to manage from going up and down, it helps to regenerate some of that muscle they could’ve atrophied during the time of their illness.""  health experts told fox news it is important for patients recovering from covid to get  clearance  to begin an exercise program.  the cardiologist explained ""i approach these patients as if they’ve recently had a cardiac procedure. meaning, i sent them for a baseline  exercise  stress test to assess their basic functional status. based upon the results of that exercise stress test, i then refer them to cardiac rehab.""  grayver added, ""that usually helps them significantly. once they complete the program, they feel physically, mentally and emotionally stronger to continue with their own independent exercise regimen"" for patients with underlying lung pathology issues grayver suggested individuals keep a close eye on the pulse oximetry. ""if patients are suffering from significant cardiac deconditioning and possible arrhythmias, heart rate monitoring will definitely help. and in order to set the guidelines in reference to how high or low anybody’s heart rate should go, getting that baseline exercise stress test would be important."" grayver shared how exercise helped her recover from covid.   ""there were many moments of significant frustration because i truly felt uncomfortable in my own skin. but every day i pushed myself a little bit longer, i lifted a little bit heavier, i ran at a steeper incline. those small little changes continue to push me both mentally and physically. putting it back into my hands, getting that power back into my body, it started to help me.""

   late last friday, the cdc released new guidance that drastically reduced indoor masking recommendations. prior guidance recommended more than 90 percent of americans and 100 percent of public school students mask indoors. under the new guidance, the cdc recommends just 29 percent of americans and just 31 percent of public school students do so. the question to ask is not why the cdc made this dramatic change. it’s, why now? restaurant owner rips city officials, white house for ‘extremely political’ decisions to lift mask mandates     
      a pedestrian removes a protective mask worn as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus in philadelphia, wednesday, march 2, 2022. (ap photo/matt rourke) 
       the answer seems clear—the cdc bent to political pressure from the biden administration. since the omicron peak, opinion pages have increasingly challenged the cdc’s overly restrictive recommendations. state after state ended their own mandates as covid cases subsided and as the public’s trust—and practices—grew increasingly out of step with cdc guidance. last friday, only seven states maintained mask mandates, while over half of public school students attended mask optional schools. if the cdc was confident that 70 percent of the public need not wear masks, why did it wait so much longer than states did to announce this? and why in a late friday news dump? if school specific masking requirements were unnecessary, why keep blanket school recommendations for so long?   video the reason it happened on friday is clear. the announcement paved the way for president joe biden’s state of the union address. under the new guidance, president biden was able to enter the house chamber unmasked and trumpet that ""under these new guidelines, most americans in most of the country can now be mask free… covid-19 need no longer control our lives."" regarding schools, biden shrugged off indifference evident one week prior to say, ""most americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom, and move forward safely."" this timing seems more than just convenient. in mid-february, nbc reported, senior white house officials asked cdc director rochelle walensky to update the mask guidance prior to the state of the union. nbc noted, ""the white house has been eager for the cdc to provide an update on its indoor mask recommendation, although it wants the agency to get it right, and it doesn’t want to appear as though it is putting political pressure on the agency.""

       (saul loeb/afp/bloomberg via getty images) on this count, the administration failed spectacularly. cdc’s timing appears to be motivated by political expediency and little else. after all, no new scientific breakthroughs or studies spurred this change. and while the new guidance does use better data—adding county covid-19 hospitalizations and hospital bed occupancy data to the covid-19 case rate data—that data has been available for months. the only ""pressure on the agency"" that explains the timing of friday’s announcement is political pressure. click here to get the opinion newsletter potential interference from the administration is a profound concern. it undermines the already fragile trust the public has in the cdc as an independent scientific agency. the cdc’s failure to act before now also points to significant failings within it, raising another question: how much longer might the cdc have waited if not for pressure from the state of the union? click here to get the fox news app in light of such glaring circumstantial evidence, congress should investigate whether the biden administration put pressure on the cdc. they can start by requesting early drafts of the state of union to determine whether the administration anticipated the cdc announcement. if so, congress should probe into their role in that decision. if the cdc’s change was merely a happy coincidence for biden’s address, congress should hold the cdc to account for delaying guidance that affects the lives of millions of american schoolchildren. congress not only has the prerogative, but the responsibility to investigate.

   california  state regulators conducted an investigation at a  san diego  preschool and privately interviewed children as young as 2 without their parents’ consent about their masking practices. officials with the california department of social services (cdss) visited all three locations of aspen leaf preschool in january after receiving a complaint that the  school  was not enforcing the state’s mask mandate, according to the cdss’ response to a complaint by the preschool’s owner, howard wu. nyc parents plan to sue the mayor over mask mandates for young kids according to the cdss letter, which wu shared with fox news digital, officials with the agency’s community care licensing division entered the three preschool locations on jan. 19, separated the children from their teachers and interviewed them privately about their masking practices.  in his complaint to the agency, wu described the investigation as a ""simultaneous, multi-school raid"" that resulted in ""unnecessary and inappropriate child interviews."" ""every family we heard from after the inspections were furious about the interviews,"" wu told fox news digital. ""we were open the whole pandemic about not masking children and the reasons why. the policy was on our website. put simply, the mask guidance says children can not mask when eating and sleeping. in full day child care that’s 3 hours, so masking at other times offers no health benefit. all the families (except 1 in january) supported the policy."" wu also argues that the cdss does not have the authority to enforce a mask mandate instituted by another agency, in this case the california department of public health.

""you have to take into account whether someone has already had covid-19 because they may already be protected, and while the data is clear for vaccinating high-risk children … it is less clear vaccinating otherwise healthy children, whether there is any benefit, and there is no data showing that."" california officials raided preschool, interviewed 2-year-olds over mask policies according to the tampa bay times, more than 804,000 florida children under 16 have contracted covid-19, and 42 of those children died, for a death rate of 0.005 percent. the rate is likely lower, as countless cases go unreported. ""my honest opinion, otherwise healthy young kids who have recovered from covid are unlikely to demonstrate significant benefit from the vaccine,"" saphier told fox news digital. the vaccines have been highly effective throughout the pandemic in reducing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death, but they do not prevent getting or transmitting the virus. children have been at a far lower risk of severe outcomes than older people from coronavirus throughout the pandemic, although their hospitalization rate hit  record highs  during the omicron variant surge in december and january.

       in anchorage, alaska, school superintendent deena bishop says lifting the mandate in the city’s nearly 100 public schools last week was a relief after months of acrimony even though there were some bumpy patches. bishop says she has been made aware of a handful of comments teachers inadvertently made that ""didn’t sit well"" with students and their parents, such as a teacher singling out a young child whose parents decided to keep them wearing a mask and another who had made a student feel guilty about their decision not to wear one. she said the instances served as ""teachable moments"" to remind staff that ""a choice is a choice and that we need to honor that home’s choice."" ""there was a lot of angst, a lot of battles in the city over wearing masks, not wearing masks,"" bishop said. ""so i’m glad that we’ve taken that fight away. all that has just subsided, and now we can go back to focus on learning."" falling infection rates and new federal health guidance are leading most of the remaining states with statewide school mask requirements to drop the mandates. the centers for disease control and prevention  recently issued new guidelines  saying most americans live in places where healthy people, including students, can safely take a break from wearing masks. but those hesitant about ending school mask mandates often point to low childhood vaccination rates among american children. only about a quarter of children ages 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and about 58% of children ages 12 to 17 are inoculated, the cdc says. new york, connecticut, massachusetts, illinois, and delaware rescinded their statewide school mask requirements recently. new jersey and rhode island dropped theirs officially monday while california, oregon, and washington have  jointly announced they'll drop their statewide mandates  effective march 12. in many instances, the ultimate decisions are being made at the local school district level.

       officials many large cities, such as boston, los angeles, and washington, d.c., have said they'll keep mask rules for now, either until vaccination rates improve among their students, or they can work out agreements with teachers unions, which have been among those most vocal about keeping the mandates in place. after chicago schools announced monday that masks will no longer be required as of march 14, the city's teachers union vowed to take officials to court, saying the move will violate an agreement with the district to keep the mask rule through the end of the school year. in new york city, elementary student jack jalaly ditched his mask monday as they became optional in the nation's largest school district. ""i think it’s nice because kids can finally see their teachers talk, and i also have a younger daughter who has spent all her time with no face, right?"" said jack's mother, andrea. ""so for little kids, it’s really great because you can see the way words are pronounced and you can see spellings. but third-grader derrick carter-jacob kept his mask on as new york eliminated the requirement. ""i don't want to get covid,"" he said. ""leave it on. there’s no reason for him to take it off until basically everybody is safe,"" said his parent, michael jacob. ""i want my son to be safe. i’m sorry. that’s the way i see it."" john bracey, a latin teacher at belmont high school in suburban boston, says he intends to keep wearing his hospital-grade n-95 respirator through the end of the academic year even as district officials are expected to decide on their school mandate later this week. nyc parents plan to sue the mayor over mask mandates for young kids the 41-year-old bellingham resident said he and his wife have also decided to keep his two young school-age children wearing masks this week even though their district lifted the requirement monday. ""i have major concerns on so many levels,"" bracey said. ""it appears to be a decision made to benefit the most privileged and leaves everyone else to their own devices. we’re sacrificing the health of immunocompromised students, elderly staff, and those of us with young children. i just can’t find a public health or moral justification for removing them."" in needham, another boston suburb, school administrators waited until monday — a full week after the state eased its mask requirement — in part to prepare students for the transition this week to what they call a ""mask-friendly environment,"" says school superintendent daniel gutekanst. he said the work, which included posters and informational videos created by district officials, appears to have paid off, with no reports of major disputes or other issues around mask-wearing after classes ended monday. melissa bello says her two school-age children were among those that gladly removed their masks monday. she says her 8-year-old son has hearing loss in both ears and has been complaining of having trouble understanding people in school with everyone wearing masks the last two years. ""he’s working harder everyday in school and coming home more tired,"" bello said. ""there’s not enough consideration for those kinds of tradeoffs in these mask mandates."" but jason chan, another parent in needham, said his two school-age children went in monday still wearing masks — and likely still will through the week before the family reassesses.

       tsa to extend covid mask mandate for another month prior to the pandemic, reading levels were on the decline according to reports. educators said the pandemic exacerbated the problem and steps need to be taken to help students ""catch up"" with reading and literacy skills. nora palma, a special education teacher in new york, told fox news, ""the literacy gap right now has shown us that we cannot simply ""return to normal"" because we are dealing with issues that we have never seen before.""  palma explained to fox news that teachers are concerned over the reading deficiency reports and fear if they are not addressed at an early age, it could lead to increased dropout rates by the time the students reach high school age. ""we feel the pressure to catch kids up to grade-level standards but we are lacking the support and resources that our students need- especially when our data shows that many are 3-4 grade levels behind."" the special education teacher also said, ""teacher burnout is a direct result of feeling like there is nothing you can do to ‘fix’ these gaps on your own but being expected to. sadly it seems that students that can catch up will and those who can’t will likely fall even farther behind."" state push biden to rescind head start mask mandate for children as young as 2 palma said a potential solution is integrating explicit phonics-based literacy instruction, such as a program called  fundations.   ""fundations is an incredible program part of the wilson reading program. i have witnessed illiterate adults learn to read with this program. there is data to support the fact that special ed referrals would drastically decrease if all students were offered a phonics-based reading program. typically, after 3rd grade, the focus is shifted from ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn.’ without foundational literacy skills students cannot access content- if you cannot access content, you can be compliant, but you cannot not engage in learning. what’s the point?"" laura seinfeld, dean of liu post college of education, information and technology in new york, told fox news, ""teachers have always held a critical role in our society and i truly believe that the covid-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of teachers and their impact in meeting the academic, social, and emotional needs of all students.""

""people in this city aren’t stupid. they can open their eyes."" as covid-19 took root in the u.s., people on the street were largely left on their own — with many cities halting sweeps of homeless camps following guidance from federal health officials. the lack of remediation led to a situation that has spiraled out of control in many places, with frustrated residents calling for action as extreme forms of poverty play out on city streets.

       (ap photo/alex brandon, file) advocates for the homeless have denounced aggressive measures, saying the problem is being treated as a blight or a chance for cheap political gains instead of a humanitarian crisis. donald h. whitehead jr., executive director of the national coalition for the homeless, said at least 65 u.s. cities are criminalizing or sweeping encampments. ""everywhere that there is a high population of homeless people, we started to see this as their response."" portland’s homeless crisis has grown increasingly visible in recent years. during the area’s 2019  point-in-time count  — a yearly census of sorts — an estimated 4,015 people were experiencing homelessness, with half of them ""unsheltered"" or sleeping outside. advocates say the numbers have likely significantly increased. last month, wheeler used his emergency powers to ban camping on the sides of ""high-crash"" roadways, which encompass about 8% of the total area of the city. the decision followed a report showing 19 of 27 pedestrians killed by cars in portland last year were homeless. people in at least 10 encampments were given 72 hours to leave. los angeles county homeless count to begin after covid-19 shuttered last year's event ""it’s been made very clear people are dying,"" wheeler said. ""so i approach this from a sense of urgency."" wheeler’s top adviser — sam adams, a former portland mayor — has also outlined a  controversial plan  that would force up to 3,000 homeless people into massive temporary shelters staffed by oregon national guard members. advocates say the move, which marks a major shift in tone and policy, would ultimately criminalize homelessness. ""i understand my suggestions are big ideas,"" adams wrote. ""our work so far, mine included, has … failed to produce the sought-after results."" oregon’s democratic governor rejected the idea. but  adams says  if liberal cities don’t take drastic action, ballot measures that crack down on homelessness may emerge instead. that’s what happened in left-leaning austin, texas. last year voters there reinstated a ban that penalizes those who camp downtown and near the university of texas, in addition to making it a crime to ask for money in certain areas and times

""talk to someone on the street and literally just hear a little bit about their stories — i mean, honestly, homelessness can happen to any one of us,"" said laura recko, associate director of external communications for central city concern in portland. and some question whether the tougher approach is legal, citing the 2018 federal court decision known as martin v. city of boise, idaho, that said cities cannot make it illegal for people to sleep or rest outside without providing sufficient indoor alternatives. click here to get the fox news app whitehead, of the national coalition for the homeless, thought the landmark ruling would force elected officials to start developing long-term fixes and creating enough shelter beds for emergency needs. instead, some areas are ignoring the decision or finding ways around it, he said.
