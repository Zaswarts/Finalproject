LAURA INGRAHAM:   Nearly three weeks into this war of choice by Vladimir Putin, we see the horrors of his brutality, even against civilians. We also know that with America run by a hologram president with a hobbled economy, chaos reigns and our enemies are emboldened. The world is changing rapidly. And what happens next? It's not easy to predict. Still, there are signs that a peace deal may be within reach.  RELATED: INGRAHAM: BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PEDDLING PROPAGANDA ON ‘A REGULAR BASIS’ Now, there's clearly a deal here for the making, yet do any of you feel watching TV or reading online any urgency for peace, actual peace? Now, of course, Putin could just decide to stop the shelling right now, but he's not going to do that unless he gets something for it. And President Xi and one called Vladimir Putin could end these hostilities. Hey, Vlad, no more wheat purchases, no more oil buys to vanish until you stop the killing. But Xi's not going to do that right now. He has Western Europe and America all tied up in knots, blowing billions of dollars, trying to help Ukraine after the fact, then leaving more discounted Russian oil for China.

   The U.S.  Senate  unanimously approved a resolution late Tuesday seeking investigations of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime for war crimes over the invasion of  Ukraine . The bipartisan measure from Sen.  Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., says the Senate strongly condemns the ""violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity"" being carried out by Russian military forces under Putin’s direction. It encourages international criminal courts to investigate Putin, his security council and military leaders for possible war crimes. ""These atrocities deserve to be investigated for war crimes,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. MCCONNELL CALLS ON BIDEN TO DEPLOY ADDITIONAL US TROOPS TO EASTERN EUROPE, EXPAND TRIP TO 'GO BEYOND' BRUSSELS The measure was approved swiftly and without dissent as lawmakers in Congress continue to muscle a bipartisan show of force against the Russian war in Ukraine. First introduced almost two weeks ago, the Senate resolution would not carry the force of law, but is another example of Congress providing the Biden administration political support to take a tough line against Putin’s aggression. Last week, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris embraced calls for an international war crimes investigation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, citing the ""atrocities"" of bombing civilians, including a maternity hospital.

Cotton: Zelenkyy's address was 'very moving'   Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging President Biden to be 'leader of the world.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Putin  has gone to tremendous lengths to deny Russians access to information about what’s really happening in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s address to Congress is the last thing he wants them to hear. Indeed, even the image of  Zelenskyy  still standing is an embarrassment for Putin. The war was supposed to be over by now. But nothing is going as Putin planned, and that, for him, is a huge problem. But  Ukraine  faces desperate problems as well. Zelenskyy asked Washington to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine and to provide it with warplanes. But despite his heartfelt words and a moving video played as part of his presentation, Washington is unlikely to grant either request.

       (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, Pool) Indeed, there is little likelihood that the West will go much beyond what it is already doing in response to  Putin’s aggression . NATO has deployed additional forces to deter Putin from thinking the alliance won’t defend the alliance. But it is also clear that the alliance has no desire to become an active belligerent in the current conflict. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   Western aid has kept Ukraine in the fight by providing a lifeline of lethal and non-lethal aid, food and medical supplies. That aid will continue, and it is doubtful the Russian troops can cut it off. And while offering up fighter jets remains problematic for NATO leaders, don’t be surprised if supplies of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles and more sophisticated combat drones make their way to Ukraine. Since Zelenskyy pressed so publicly, it will be a lot harder for nations to say no.       Video Ukraine’s European neighbors are stepping up to care for the millions of refugees fleeing the country. On the other hand, international aid agencies appear completely unwilling to go to even those parts of Ukraine untouched by fighting to aid the internally displaced persons. This is crushing burden for the Ukrainians. Zelenskyy should have pushed more on this front. BIDEN APPROVES MORE ANTI-AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS, DRONES FOR UKRAINE, WARNS OF 'LONG AND DIFFICULT BATTLE' What this all means, as Zelenskyy’s dramatic and inspiring speech emphasized, is that this war isn’t likely to get any easier. The big question is: What comes next?   Video For Putin, even the ""best case"" scenario is bad: He finds himself the conqueror of a prostrate country that will require most of his army to occupy. Even if Moscow had designs to move against some of its other neighbors, the regime will have to take a ""strategic pause"" to consolidate and reset.   Video One test for the West will be how it takes advantage of this interlude. The Russian military has been exposed as incompetent, adept only at killing innocents and destroying cities.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Yet as long as the Russian military remains under the control of its current leadership, it will remain a grave threat to European peace, prosperity and security.

       ( ) If NATO doesn’t build up its defenses, reinvigorate its nuclear deterrence and race for energy independence, this time will be wasted.

   A private  Ukraine  zookeeper located outside Kyiv fears he will lose every animal under his care to starvation and cold if relief doesn't come soon. Mykhailo Pinchuk, owner and founder of the  ""XII (12) Months"" zoo  in the village of Demydiv, told Fox News Digital he and the small staff still left are ""desperate"" to get either safe passage or livable conditions for the roughly 350 animals that include giraffes, hippos, tigers, lions, and chimpanzees. In the meantime, he's seeking a ""green"" humanitarian corridor to bring in badly needed food as well as fuel to keep the animals warm. They have been essentially cut off since the second day of the Russian invasion that began Feb. 24. ""[I'm trying] to draw the attention and somehow persuade the [Russian] troops, their commanders, their politicians, that animals are innocent creatures and these are the lives we have and must save, and they have nothing to do with that war,"" Pinchuk told Fox News Digital. ""I really hope they will not die like this,"" he added. FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT BENJAMIN HALL SAFELY OUT OF UKRAINE AFTER SUFFERING SERIOUS INJURIES There is very little food left for the animals, who are being fed far under their usual daily rations. And with Russians encircling Kyiv, the only way out, Pinchuk said, would be to drive north to the hottest combat areas. So far, he has only been able to get scant Red Cross food rations in for him and his remaining seven staff members at the roughly 40-acre complex. ""To sum up, we see that the only way out for us is they allow us in, we bring in diesel and food for large animals, and then we can take some smaller ones out, and maybe we will be able to preserve the collection,"" he said. ""Other than this, it is a question of death of hunger and cold, and it is coming pretty soon, I know that.""

""We are crying, we're shouting, we're doing whatever we can to draw attention that I at least go there with some food and fuel to warm them up and feed them, and the smallest animals I can take to a different zoo,"" he said. ""You cannot transport a rhino by a broken bridge,"" he added, noting Ukrainian forces have destroyed bridges in an effort to stall the Russian advance.

Axios first  reported  that the administration is considering removing the military force from the FTO in return for a commitment from Iran to de-escalate in the region.

       The designation was put onto the IRGC during the Trump administration, and Iran has continually called for it to be removed as part of the negotiations. Such a move would be controversial given the IRGC’s high profile role in destabilizing the region via proxies. Talks have been ongoing for weeks in Vienna to bring Iran back into the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which both the U.S. and Iran had left. The FTO designation was put in place by the Trump administration in 2019 after it left the deal a year earlier. The administration also launched a strike to take out IRGC’s Gen.

""Among other issues, we are highly concerned about reports indicating the potential lifting of the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and of the sanctions placed on members of the office of the Supreme Leader,"" the letter said. On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mike Turner, R-Ohio, expressed concern about the potential move. ""The IRGC has represented nothing more than a destabilizing presence in the Middle East,"" Turner said. ""News that the Biden Administration is considering removing the IRGC from the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list is unsettling. We must remain vigilant in protecting our nation and allies, like Israel, from growing and potential threats – this certainly will not be accomplished by stripping the IRGC of this designation and could impact the ability of our government to stop bad actors."" Iranian resistance groups have also warned against such a move.

   MSNBC's Chris Hayes suggested Tuesday that countries accepting Ukrainian refugees amid the Russian invasion, such as Poland, were racist to not accept Syrian refugees 11-years-ago.  ""For many reasons, including, frankly, racism, anti-Muslim bigotry, the paranoia of post-9/11 war on terror, many of those same countries, which quite explicitly refused to accept refugees that Russia created in Syria are, to their credit, opening their borders and opening their arms to refugees Russia is creating in Ukraine,"" Hayes said on MSNBC's ""All In.""

He argued that Farage used the crisis as basis of breaking with the European Union.  ""It was those images, it was the specter of the refugee crisis, it was a major factor enabling Donald Trump's rise to power,"" Hayes continued.

   Every other hour, another packed train from Poland arrives at Berlin’s main train station filled with hundreds of Ukrainian refugees, mostly mothers and their children looking for a safe place away from the brutal war in their home country. As they spilled out of the trains on Tuesday, loudspeakers blared in Ukrainian and English: ""Dear refugees from Ukraine, welcome to Germany, please follow the instructions of the volunteers in the yellow and orange vests."" UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY SHOWS CONGRESS VIDEO OF VICTIMS, DESTRUCTION: 'HEART-WRENCHING TO WATCH' Spread across the platforms, a small army of volunteers in bright-colored vests appeared — yellow for those who speak German, English and other languages, orange for Ukrainian and Russian speakers — ready to maneuver the exhausted masses through the maze of Berlin’s sleek and shiny glass-and-steel railway station into the building’s basement. The operation runs so smoothly that the seemingly endless stream of refugees goes largely unnoticed to the city’s tens of thousands of regular commuters making their way through the station’s five levels. Most don’t even know of the sprawling refugee town that has sprung up in the station basement. Vadim, a 17-year-old teenager who came on his own from Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, traveled for three days and nights before arriving in Berlin on Tuesday afternoon. ""No sleep,"" is all he said, a tired, petrified look in his eyes.

Like Vadim, most refugees were too exhausted and traumatized to say much. Their frightened looks seemed to reflect the horrors of war. They sat huddled on long rows of wooden beer benches and tables, tightly holding onto plastic bags, school backpacks or duffel bags containing the few belongings they packed before fleeing the wailing sirens, detonating missiles and hastily arranged funerals back home. RICK SCOTT SAYS AMERICA MUST STOP BLOODSHED IN UKRAINE WITH NO-FLY ZONE OR MORE PLANES More than 3 million refugees have left Ukraine since Russia attacked the country three weeks ago. Most have fled to neighboring countries such as Poland, Moldova and Romania. But as the war continues and civilians are increasingly in the crosshairs of the Russian military, many are making their way further west. Some 160,000 Ukrainian refugees have been officially registered in Germany, but their real numbers are thought to be much higher as Ukrainians can enter Germany without visas and there are no thorough controls along the Polish-German border.

       (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) Berlin has become the No. 1 gateway for tens of thousands of refugees, with around 7,500 arriving at the train station every day. Because city officials were initially slow to react to the massive influx, thousands of volunteers have stepped up to help cater to the refugees’ every needs. They take the new arrivals from station platforms to a waiting area in the basement next to a McDonald’s. There, an entire refugee town opens up: Volunteers hand out food and hot drinks, stands offer free shampoo, diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins and other hygiene supplies. A nursing tent is set up for moms wanting to breastfeed their babies. There is a safe zone for children with toys and boxes full of second-hand clothes, as well as volunteers offering pet food for the many dogs and cats the refugees bring with them. BIDEN ANNOUNCES ADDITIONAL $800 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE There’s also a stand operated by German railway company Deutsche Bahn handing out free train tickets for those who want to continue their travels to another destination. More than 100,000 tickets have been issued so far. Two groups catering specifically to the needs of LGBTQ refugees and people of color have set up tables next to a COVID-19 testing station, and there are volunteers handing out cell phone chargers, power banks and German SIM cards so the refugees can keep up their lifelines to the husbands, fathers and sons who stayed back home to defend their country against the Russian invasion. ""When the first thousands of refugees arrived here, it quickly became clear that up on the platforms, where the trains arrive from Poland, there was not enough space. That’s why our station management very quickly decided to free up a protected area in the basement,"" Deutsche Bahn spokeswoman Anja Broeker told The Associated Press.

       (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) ""There, together with the many volunteers who also very quickly organized themselves ... we have been creating an aid structure that’s getting better with each passing day."" The operation runs efficiently: Volunteers know their place and task; they are friendly and patient, but the atmosphere is eerily quiet and subdued. There’s no loud laughter or chatter, no shouting, not even babies crying, only the hum of the escalators and the shrieking sound of braking trains entering the station. About a third of those who arrive plan to stay, but most have no family or friends to welcome and shelter them, no place to sleep. So the volunteers bring them to a big white tent outside the back entrance of the station, next to the Spree River and within sight of the Chancellery. MCCONNELL CALLS ON BIDEN TO DEPLOY ADDITIONAL US TROOPS TO EASTERN EUROPE, EXPAND TRIP TO 'GO BEYOND' BRUSSELS Here, a constant flotilla of busses stands ready to take the refugees to terminal 5 of Berlin’s new BER airport, the city’s former Tegel airport or a convention center on its outskirts. In recent days, those places were turned into huge makeshift shelters filled with rows of hundreds of cots. Earlier, volunteers had lined up inside the station holding up signs saying how many refugees they could  house at their private homes. Recently, however, reports of men pretending to offer shelter and then sexually harassing and exploiting women have led authorities to warn refugees not to accept private accommodation offers. On Wednesday, authorities in the western city of Duesseldorf confirmed that  a young Ukrainian woman was allegedly sexually assaulted  by two men earlier this month. The many volunteers who spearheaded the initial help have mixed feelings about the city taking control now and some feel sidelined by the authorities.

   In an impassioned speech Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Congress whether it was ""too much to ask"" for the United States to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine. So far, though, the answer is yes. While the United States has, for the most part, been willing to entertain many forms of support to  Ukraine , senior administration and congressional leaders have categorically ruled out declaring a no-fly zone over the country.

       (Drew Angerer, Pool via AP) Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, when asked about the no-fly zone, cautioned that the United States wants to ""end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one. Senators Marco Rubio and Joni Ernest similarly warned that declaring a no-fly zone ""would be World War III."" Prominent journalists have echoed these sentiments, writing that the United States should ""banish the phrase ‘no-fly zone’"" because it would ""kick-start World War III."" Noted defense analysts have agreed.  All are essentially arguing that a no-fly zone policy is not a passive measure, that it involves shooting down Russian aircraft and attacking Russian air defenses. It is, in effect, war. Given that Russia is a nuclear adversary, therefore the thinking goes, the policy of a no-fly zone should be off the table. While American policymakers are rightfully hesitant to implement a no-fly zone policy, however, it could be a strategic mistake to say so in public.   Video First , according to the intelligence community, Putin will likely ""double down"" rather than be deterred from further aggression, so whatever atrocities have been committed, it could be much worse in the coming weeks. Russian forces have already shelled civilian targets indiscriminately and attacked a nuclear power plant, risking a nuclear catastrophe. Putin has already questioned the ""future of Ukrainian statehood"" and threatened using nuclear arms—a threat that top Russian analysts believe is plausible.  In other words, while there should be a high threshold for the United States and its allies to ever risk direct confrontation with Russia, at this point, the United States cannot be guaranteed that Russia will not cross that line. Second , while the United States and its allies try to draw a bright line between indirect confrontation—providing weapons and economic sanctions—versus direct conflict, Putin may not view the situation the same way. After all, perhaps from the Russian perspective, if the American missile shoots down a Russian aircraft, would it matter whether an American or a Ukrainian pulls the trigger? Moreover, Putin already likened the West’s economy-crushing sanctions to ""a declaration of war."" And in fairness, the extent and gravity of the West’s sanctions in the end may have a larger, longer lasting impact on Russia than whatever comes of a potential no-fly zone policy.   Video Third , while a no-fly zone policy incurs significant risks, there are several steps on the escalatory ladder between that and World War III. The Russians first must choose to challenge the no-fly zone. If they do, the United States and its allies must then shoot at the Russian forces. And then, the Russians need to respond in kind. From there, the question becomes whether the violence spirals out of control or remains tit-for-tat. While escalation is possible, both sides arguably also have the incentive to keep the conflict limited to Ukraine itself, if only to avoid mutual annihilation. Fourth , by ruling out a no-fly zone policy now, the United States loses potential leverage for a future settlement. Research suggests that sanctions, in and of themselves, rarely force states to abandon core security concerns. Indeed, some analysts have argued that Putin likely baked in at least some of the cost of sanctions into his calculations to invade Ukraine. Consequently, pushing Putin to reverse course in the country might require threatening something more, which could include direct intervention.   Video Finally , there is a question of global strategic precedents. The United States is entering a new and more dangerous period, and many of its adversaries are or will soon be armed with nuclear weapons. This currently applies to Russia, but also China, North Korea and, potentially, at some point, Iran as well. American policy vis-à-vis Ukraine, therefore, sends a broader message to these other adversaries: If the United States rules out options—like a no-fly zone policy—a priori, then it could send a powerful signal to other nefarious actors that if one has nuclear weapons, one can shield oneself from any American military action. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As an operational choice, the United States and its allies may not want to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine right now. Such a decision would likely come at the cost of American lives, potentially a lot of them. It would also incur risk, including potentially nuclear escalation. There are a slew of logistical and operational factors that would need to weighed as well. All these factors may make an indirect approach of supplying Ukraine with anti-aircraft systems the preferable tactical option for the moment.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As a matter of strategic policy, though, American leaders should leave a no-fly zone on the table. Given its behavior over the last several weeks, Russia may force the United States’ hand. And even if the United States never implements it, keeping a no-fly zone policy as an option retains American leverage and avoids dangerous global precedents. Indeed, the only worse option to implementing a no-fly zone may be ruling out such a policy entirely. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY RAPHAEL S. COHEN  ",2022-03

   Russia is attempting to indoctrinate children in school by explaining that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a ""liberation mission"" being done to protect ""the people of Donbas from genocide,"" according to one expert.

   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  has pleaded with U.S. leaders and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country as it continues warring with Russia, setting off a debate about the consequences such a move would have.  ""If there were a no-fly zone, and we had to enforce it, that would mean U.S. planes flying concurrently with Russian ones. And you'd run the risk of U.S. planes downing Russians or vice versa,"" Dan Hoffman, a Fox News contributor and former CIA station chief in Moscow, told Fox News Digital.  A no-fly zone bans aircraft from a specific area and is sometimes used over government buildings for security reasons. The zones have also been imposed during times of conflict to prevent military aircraft from attacking the area.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Hoffman told Fox News Digital that going back to the Cold War, U.S. strategy has dictated ""no direct, kinetic engagement with the Soviet Union or with Russia."" ""That means our soldiers aren't raising their firearms to go shoot them in the face and vice versa,"" he said. Instead, the U.S. has fought proxy wars with Russia since the end of World War II, including  currently in Ukraine . A no-fly zone, however, could change that and put U.S. soldiers in direct conflict with Russians.

He also called on NATO and  President Biden  last week to impose a no-fly zone over ""significant parts"" of the country.  ""We repeat every day: ‘Close the sky over Ukraine!'"" Zelenskyy said in a video posted to Twitter Sunday, accompanied by English subtitles.  But his appeals have hit a brick wall.  NATO and the White House have denied imposing the no-fly zone, while some U.S. leaders have described such a move as coming with disastrous consequences.  ""The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe.""      
      NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a media conference after a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Tuesday, Feb. 22, 2022. 
       (AP Photo/Olivier Matthys) A no-fly zone risks a direct military conflict with Russia. It has the potential of escalating to a third world war, pitting nuclear power countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K. against fellow  nuclear power Russia .  A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 74% of Americans across the political spectrum support a no-fly zone. But some U.S. leaders say the issue is far more complicated than just prohibiting aircraft over Ukraine.  "" If people understand what it means , it means World War III. It means starting World War III,"" Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Saturday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""It's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by. It's the willingness to shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World War III."" Democrats have also sounded the alarm on imposing a no-fly zone, including Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.  ""I think we need to be clear that we are not going to go to war with Russia, that would be the beginning of WWIII, and it would drag all of Europe into a much broader war,"" Murphy said on "" Fox News Sunday. "" Zelenskyy addressed such concerns Monday and said that Russian aircraft bombing his country, including schools, ""need to be shot down"" to ""preserve lives."" ""I'm sure that the brave American soldiers who would be shooting it down knowing that it is flying towards the students — I'm sure that they had no doubt in doing so,"" he told ABC News.  HUMANITARIAN NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE PROPOSED BY FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER Some U.S. lawmakers,  such as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin,  however, have signaled that the no-fly zone option should remain on the table, while retired NATO supreme commander U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove said that a humanitarian no-fly zone could allow for relief trains to get into the country and for the wounded to be cared for.

   An adoptive mom from Kentucky has made the perilous journey from the U.S. to Poland and now  Ukraine, near Lviv , to try to get her daughter-to-be (age 18) out of Ukraine and to safety amid the war that's been raging since Feb. 24, 2022.  Colleen Thompson of Kentucky began the process of adopting a teenager from Ukraine three years ago —  a story Fox News Digital originally told earlier this month .  The girl, who just turned 18, can legally leave the orphanage structure in Ukraine — she signed a letter of intent to that effect — but the Russian attacks on Ukraine have not only thrown the entire process into chaos and uncertainty, they've endangered (and are still endangering) the lives of many orphans. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Thompson told Fox News Digital in a phone interview on Monday, ""Our daughter was in the war zone the night Russia invaded."" She was referring to the Donetsk area, where the girl's earlier home, the Emerald City orphanage, was located.     
      This teen girl, identified only as ""M,"" has been stuck in Ukraine. Colleen Thompson of Kentucky is trying with all her might to get her out of there.
       (Colleen Thompson) Once the invasion began, the children were rushed westward across Ukraine. As of Monday, they were positioned on the outskirts of Lviv, hiding out and trying to dodge the Russian attacks. For the past 10 days, Thompson herself has been in war-torn Ukraine — and given the chaos and confusion of the situation, she's ready to show up at her daughter's orphanage with a lawyer and the police in tow, if she has to, to take her daughter out of there.  KENTUCKY MOM OF 8 DESPERATE TO RESCUE TEEN GIRL FROM UKRAINE ""They’re literally holding my daughter hostage,"" said Thompson on Monday. The mother of eight — who's been hoping for a ninth child for about three years and already considers the girl her own — also said, ""She has waited 18 years to have somebody say ‘you’re my daughter.' I don’t care if there are bombs flying, I’m not leaving her. She’s not alone anymore. I just need to find a way to get her out.""     
      The girl, identified only as ""M,"" wants to go home to Kentucky with her new American parents. The war in Ukraine has complicated everything. 
       (Colleen Thompson) Eighteen-year-old ""M"" (her full name is withheld for safety and privacy) was evacuated along with the other children via police escort the morning after the shelling began. They spent two days crossing Ukraine, including in active war zones, from its eastern edge to the western portion of the country. ""It’s inexcusable,"" said Thompson of the current conditions. ""These kids are being terrorized again."" UKRAINE BY THE NUMBERS: REFUGEES TOP 2.5 MILLION The children were not permitted to bring any personal belongings with them during the journey. ""M,"" for example, had a beloved stuffed toy Rottweiler called ""Archie,"" named for the Thompson family’s actual Rottweiler, Archie, whom ""M"" fell in love with during her two visits to the Thompson home.      
      The girl known as ""M"" is shown with the Thompson family dog, Archie, during an earlier trip to the U.S. To this day, ""M"" asks to see Archie whenever she talks via Facetime with her family-to-be, Colleen Thompson said.
       (Colleen Thompson) Rescuing a child  Colleen Thompson flew into Krakow, Poland, on March 3, but from that point on, transportation became difficult. Because of the war, trains no longer had predictable schedules, so ultimately, Thompson went to the border by taxi — which dropped her off in a parking lot. ""I have never been that scared in my life. I’m helpless. My child is in a bomb shelter with bombs going off.""   As soon as she realized the walking path over the border was closed, Thompson began knocking on car windows until she found a man who spoke some English who was also willing to give her a lift.  However, during the car ride, the man started ""getting a little too handsy,"" she said — so when she reached the checkpoint, she solicited the help of an English-speaking border agent. The border agent shepherded Thompson away from the ""frisky grandpa"" onto a Lviv-bound bus packed with supplies. Thompson was the only human passenger.      
      Most of the Thompson family of Kentucky are shown on the left; on the right, ""M,"" whom they already love and want to have at home with them forever.
       (Colleen Thompson) After a brief intermission, during which men in military uniforms transferred the bus's contents to a semi, the bus dropped her off at a deserted intersection in Lviv around 5 a.m. one morning.  Thompson walked until she found a bus depot with a light on. Eventually, she got a taxi ride to her friend’s apartment — and from there, she's been planning the rescue of ""M"" amid the war. ‘Are you OK, Mom?’ Thompson said her friend's apartment is about 35 minutes away from where her daughter's temporary orphanage is located, on the outskirts of Lviv.  ""She called me from a bomb shelter at 6 a.m.,"" said Thompson. A frantic ""M"" said she was calling to ask if Thompson had heard the bombs — and urged her to get to a shelter.     
      Thompson had a precarious journey from Poland to Ukraine this month as she's been preparing to find and bring home her adoptive daughter. She took these images of travel shown here.
       (Colleen Thompson) ""Are you OK, Mom?"" she asked, as Thompson told Fox News Digital. Said Thompson about this conversation, ""I have never been that scared in my life. I’m helpless. My child is in a bomb shelter with bombs going off, and I can’t do anything [about it]. I cannot do anything to help her,"" Thompson went on. ""I cannot keep her safe. I can’t get people to help me keep her safe."" ""Kids who wind up in an orphanage have been through enough trauma in their lives.""   Though the original plan for the children from the Emerald City orphanage was to cross the border to Poland, those plans changed when the orphanage’s director reportedly abandoned them. ""M"" and the 42 other children who are ages 7 to 17 cannot leave for Poland without the permission of the now-absent director of their original Donetsk region facility. ""Kids who wind up in an orphanage have been through enough trauma in their lives,"" said Thompson. ""They've lived through things many of us cannot imagine.""     
      Another image from Thompson's journey to find her future daughter in western Ukraine.
       (Colleen Thompson) Thompson described the current orphanage set-up outside Lviv: ""There are two guards at this guard booth. There is an 8-to-10-foot wall around this orphanage. The front gate is locked."" A gate near the facility that was meant to allow in cars has been chained shut, said Thompson. ‘Basically abandoned' ""By Ukrainian law, ‘M’ is allowed to leave with me [for] the safety of Poland and then, I hope, on to the U.S.,"" said Thompson, struggling to keep her emotions under wraps. ""There’s no caretaker from her original orphanage. There is no one who has guardianship [of the girl].""   ""M"" is technically an adult at age 18, and she's applied for release from the orphanage; but the adults who are running the temporary orphanage will not let her go. That's why Thompson has been making plans to bring an attorney plus police, if she has to, to secure the girl's release. ""My daughter’s been dropped here. She’s basically abandoned,"" Thompson said. ""There’s no caretaker from her original orphanage. There is no one who has guardianship anywhere in this whole region [of Lviv]. She’s in limbo."" CHICAGO MOM FLIES TO HELP UKRAINIANS AT BORDER While the temporary facility in Lviv is physically holding the young woman, the people there are also saying they have no decision-making power when it comes to her release, said Thompson. The facility is apparently demanding a signoff from the girl's orphanage in Donetsk — although that facility is no longer operating because of the war. Human trafficking concerns  Thompson has a larger worry that she shared with Fox News Digital. ""There are [orphans] being taken out of Ukraine who are not accounted for,"" said Thompson. She is determined the girl known as ""M"" will not become one of them.  EVERYDAY UKRAINIANS STRUGGLING TO STAY ALIVE GRATEFUL FOR HELP, PRAYERS Thompson said some orphans and orphan groups have already been transferred to Austria, Spain, Greece, Germany and Switzerland, though Ukrainian orphans were supposed to all be registered and travel only to Poland.

       (Colleen Thompson) ""I have at least 300 families on my spreadsheet"" who are in the process of adopting children from Ukraine, said Thompson; she's part of a network of adoptive parents in the U.S.  She's concerned that adoptive families whose children are moved to countries that disallow international adoption  may lose those little ones forever. ""It’s like they’ve just erased all the Americans,"" said Thompson. She said many of the mid-adoption-process American families have hosted Ukrainian children before and had home studies completed; some were also in the final stages of their adoptions and were awaiting paperwork. UKRAINIAN EXCHANGE STUDENT IS PROUD OF HIS COUNTRY AMID WAR ""A group [of orphaned children] were taken by bus from Lviv [on Monday] straight to Austria,"" said Thompson. She said Americans in the process of adopting children from that group are following that bus to Austria ""so they can make sure their kids don’t just disappear."" Added Thompson, ""Kids are falling through giant cracks in the system.""     
      This is one of the hallways of the current orphanage in Ukraine where Colleen Thompson's future daughter has been staying during the war.
       (Colleen Thompson) Most American adoptive families of Ukrainian orphans are in Poland right now, said Thompson. She's among the few who are actually in Ukraine. ""You can get across the border with literally no documents,"" said Thompson. The group her daughter-to-be is with, said Thompson, have no documents with them — nor do they have a chaperone. Four adults at the temporary orphanage are helping to care for the children. ‘Scariest stuff’ ""This is the scariest stuff I’ve witnessed in a group setting, with children just disappearing,"" said Thompson, referencing the way groups of orphans have been bused to other countries amid the war. ""I’m also scared they’ll come with a bus and try to take ‘M,’"" she said.  Thompson believes no one is maintaining a central database to keep track of the whereabouts of Ukrainian orphans.      
      These people are trying to escape harm in Ukraine; here, a man is shown carrying a young child to safety.
       (Francesco Malavolta) She bases this opinion, in part, on interactions she's had with a woman who identified herself as ""Tatiana"" from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).  ""Tatiana"" had asked Thompson for details about children in an orphanage from Mariupol, who — amid the war — were to be transferred to Greece. Though Thompson said the OSCE rep told her they planned to bring a group of children to Greece, the woman known as ""Tatiana"" apparently did not know the names or ages of the children. Further, Thompson said, Greece does not allow for international adoptions.  While some Ukrainian orphans are in the midst of being adopted by American parents, Thompson said ""Tatiana"" could not tell her what would happen to those mid-adoption-process children if Ukraine falls to the Russian while the children are in Greece.     
      The girl known as ""M"" is shown here; her adoptive mother has been trying to get to her for weeks amid the war. Said Thompson to Fox News Digital, ""This is our child. She has never had anybody say to her, ‘You matter.’"" She added, ""I am standing here saying, ‘You matter. And I am not leaving without you.’""
       (Colleen Thompson) ""This is our child,"" Thompson emphasized. ""She has never had anybody say to her, ‘You matter.’ I am standing here saying, ‘You matter. And I am not leaving without you.'  Added Thompson, ""I may not be doing it gracefully right now, but I am standing up for her."" 'Praying for peace very meaningful for me' Thompson said she attended Mass this past Sunday —  the second Sunday of Lent this year  — at a cathedral in Lviv.      
      Colleen Thompson spent some time in prayer in this church in Lviv, Ukraine, this past week. She is hoping to see her future daughter this week — and praying she can get her back to the U.S. with her. 
       (Colleen Thompson) ""It was an emotional service for me, and I needed that time in prayer,"" she told Fox News Digital.  ""After Mass, I was able to spend some time appreciating the beauty of the church,"" she added.  ""Even with the statues above the altar covered and some of the windows boarded [in preparation for a possible Russian invasion] — it was inspiring,"" said Thompson.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   A  Ukrainian  member of parliament is warning that cities like Kyiv will be a ""second Aleppo"" unless the West steps up and backs its vocal support of Ukraine with significantly more action than it is already taking to combat the  Russian  invasion. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Oleksandra Ustinova said that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed so far in the Russian invasion and that number could rise dramatically as Russia launches attacks on cities like Kharkiv and Kiev. ""It’s a disaster, Kharkiv is in ruins and this was the second-biggest city in Ukraine with a two million population, it’s literally in ruins,"" she said. Aleppo, one of Syria's largest cities, was largely destroyed in the country's civil war a decade ago. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES     
      Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksandra Ustinova cited estimates that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in the Russian bombardment. 
       (Oleksandra Ustinova) Ustinova said the army has stopped the Russians coming into city, but the sky is open, meaning Russia can deploy missile and bombs that are hitting the civilian population sheltered in those cities. She provided photographs to Fox News that show children being sheltered underground and receiving treatment for their injuries. ""The first few days  Putin  was targeting army objectives, infrastructure objectives like airports, army bases, electric stations, now he is just shooting the civilian population,"" she said. ""They're targeting kindergartens, preschool…orphanages, maternity hospitals residential areas, that's why we have so many civilians killed."" ""So his strategy is to get as many people killed as he can and put us at the table for negotiations,"" she said. The invasion of Ukraine has seen an outpouring of support from the West, including  multiple waves of sanctions on banks and oligarchs  that have hit the Russian economy. Meanwhile, politicians and public figures in the U.S. and abroad have been vocal in their support.     
      Ukraine has accused Russia of war crimes by targeting kindergartens and child care centers.
       (Oleksandra Ustinova MP) On Tuesday, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. was applauded at the State of the Union by lawmakers, many of whom were wearing Ukrainian lapel pins.  President Biden , meanwhile, touted the sanctions his administration has imposed and the unity among NATO allies it has sparked. ""In the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security,"" he said. However, Ukrainian officials have been sounding the alarm that more needs to be done from the West, including more sweeping sanctions, more technology and a no-fly zone implemented over Ukraine. ""I saw there was a union in supporting Ukraine,"" Ustinova said. ""The question is how far the West can go in this support. Are they ready to pay 20-30 cents extra for gas in this support? So far from what I can see, no. So I'm sorry, but Ukrainians will not applaud it, Ukrainians are literally putting their lives for democracy in the world at the moment, and the world is not willing to pay extra for gas and oil."" RUSSIAN TROOPS CLOSE IN ON UKRAINE'S LARGEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AS AUTHORITIES WARN OF POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER Ustinova said the sanctions were not nearly strong enough because they are specifically carved out so they do not target the energy sector ""The sanctions that were implemented on Russia avoided the energy sector, it means you keep buying oil and gas from them and the rest of the world does. This is the number-one income for Putin and his army,"" she said.     
      Ukrainian cities have come under heavy bombardment from Russian forces. 
       (Oleksandra Ustinova MP) She said the much-touted ban on seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system does not scratch the surface. ""They switched off seven banks out of more than 300 that Russia has, that's basically, it’s not even strong sanctions,"" she said. ""We need secondary sanctions that any bank that works with a Russian bank will be sanctioned as well, it means that all the Western banks would refuse to work with any Russian bank, and that's how we can isolate their banking system."" BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HALTS ICE DEPORTATION FLIGHTS TO UKRAINE AMID RUSSIA INVASION Ustinova stressed that in the 1990s Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for guarantees about its sovereignty -- guarantees from the West that are now not being met. ""We did that because we were promised by the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia that they would protect us in case there is a threat to our sovereignty. Well, I'm sorry it's not happening, you’re not even willing to pay extra money for gas,"" she said.     
      Children have sheltered underground in Ukraine amid the Russian invasion.
       (Oleksandra Ustinova MP) Noting Biden’s promise that U.S. troops would not be sent into Ukraine, Ustinova said that Ukraine is not asking for that -- instead asking for Iron Dome-type technology, a no-fly zone and stronger sanctions on Putin.

   Kyiv, bracing for a potentially catastrophic  Russian  attack, is the spiritual heart of  Ukraine . Among the sites at risk in the Ukrainian capital are the nation's most sacred Orthodox shrines, dating back nearly 1,000 years to the dawn of  Christianity  in the region. The sites, along with other landmark shrines in Kyiv, are religiously significant to both Ukrainian Orthodox and Russian Orthodox. They also stand as powerful symbols in the quarrel over whether the two groups are parts of a single people — as  Russian President Vladimir Putin  has claimed — or are distinct but related Slavic nations. The landmarks include the golden-domed St. Sophia's Cathedral and the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, a sprawling underground and above-ground complex also known as the Monastery of the Caves. Others include the multi-towered St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery and St. Andrew’s Church.

       (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka, File) RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces damaged another monument — Ukraine’s main Holocaust memorial, Babi Yar — prompting international condemnation. ""What will be next if even Babi Yar (is hit)"" asked Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  on Wednesday. ""What other ‘military’ objects, ‘NATO bases’ are threatening Russia? St. Sophia’s Cathedral, Lavra, Andrew’s Church?"" There is no indication the Russians intentionally targeted Babi Yar. Nor is there any confirmation that the Russians plan to target any of the sacred sites in Kyiv. But civilian buildings have already been hit in other cities, and Kyiv's major shrines sit in elevated locations that could leave them especially vulnerable. Case in point: The Assumption Cathedral in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was damaged in the recent attacks, reportedly with stained-glass windows broken and other decorations damaged. The cathedral, which is under the Moscow-affiliated Orthodox church, was Kharkiv’s tallest building until sometime in the 21st century. The risk is even greater in Kyiv. ""We’re talking about a very old city,"" said Jacob Lassin, a postdoctoral research scholar at the Arizona State University’s Melikian Center for Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies. ""The center part is densely packed. Even if you’re trying to hit one thing, you could easily hit something else."" The symbolic value of the shrines is powerful even to people who don’t share the religious faith they commemorate. ""The idea that the main symbol that stood in your city for 1,000 years could be at risk or could be destroyed is very frightening,"" Lassin said.

       (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky, File) RUSSIAN JOURNALIST ESCAPES COUNTRY OUT OF FEAR FOR HIS LIFE The symbols matter not only to the Ukrainian people but to Putin, too. He justified the invasion with baseless claims he was countering ""neo-Nazism"" in Ukraine — this in a country with a Jewish president. Babi Yar, a ravine in Kyiv, is where more than 33,000 Jews were killed within 48 hours in 1941 when the city was under Nazi occupation. The killing was carried out by SS troops along with local collaborators. It was one of the largest mass killings at a single location during World War II, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. It is ""at once an accursed and a sacred place,"" American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris said. Just last year, Zelenskyy took part in the inaugural ceremony of a memorial there. Whether Kyiv’s Orthodox shrines come under direct attack or receive collateral damage, such an action would be a ""total refutation"" of another of Putin’s claims — to be defending Orthodox Ukrainians loyal to Moscow's patriarch, Lassin said. ""It would literally be destroying the main seat of Russian Orthodoxy according to his own rhetoric,"" Lassin said. The shrines' oldest parts date back to the medieval Kievan Rus kingdom, soon after its adoption of Christianity under Prince Vladimir in the 10th century. Putin has claimed the kingdom is the common ancestor of today's Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainians counter that theirs is a distinct nation now under fratricidal attack from its Slavic neighbor. The cathedral and nearby monastic complex represent ""a masterpiece of human creative genius in both its architectural conception and its remarkable decoration,"" says a summary by UNESCO, which lists them as World Heritage Sites.

""The huge pantheon of Christian saints depicted in the cathedral has an unrivaled multiplicity among Byzantine monuments of that time,"" UNESCO says.

   A senior defense official on Thursday lashed out at  China’s silence  over the illegal invasion of Ukraine by  Russian forces  after more than a week of deadly missile strikes.

""And for all their bluster about wanting to see a peaceful outcome here – they've done nothing to propose or suggest or show an interest in becoming involved in any kind of diplomatic solution."" China on Wednesday abstained from voting with another 141 nations, including the U.S., to pass a United Nations General Assembly  resolution  that condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion and demanded he immediately withdraw his troops. Of the 181 nations present for the vote, only five countries – Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria – opposed the resolution while 35 nations abstained. China justified its decision not to vote in favor of the non-legally binding resolution by claiming the draft was not properly consulted on by all member nations.

""The top priority right now is to ease the situation on the ground as much as possible."" China has condemned the severe sanctions that Russia has faced from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and dozens of European nations – claiming they have only added fuel to the fire.

   In a new  Fox Nation  production available now, subscribers are given an in-depth look at the tumultuous and often violent history of the nation now under siege by  Russian  forces.  ""Ukraine Origins""  offers viewers a tragic tableau of gut-wrenching legacies intersecting with some of the most defining moments of European history.  "" Ukrainian  history is marked by some real challenges, some real horrible scenes, some real horrible episodes,"" said Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor during the opening moments of the special.  BILL HEMMER DIVES INTO THE MACHINERY BEHIND THE RUSSIAN MILITARY FORCE One of the worst episodes can be traced back to the 1930s, when the  Soviet Union,  now known as Russia, first sank its teeth into Ukraine.   Joseph Stalin,  who was interested in the potential benefits of collectivism, wanted to replace Ukraine’s family-owned farms with state-run businesses. Simultaneously, he also wanted to punish and rid the land of Ukrainians who posed a threat to his totalitarian government. So he created a famine that killed nearly 4 million Ukrainians, the  special  explores. This was not a famine created by the environment; rather, from a man clamping down on his neighbors by imposing crippling economic policies.  ""Many Ukrainians today will remember this from what their parents and grandparents told them. This is still real for them,"" added Taylor.     
      Ukrainian servicemen stand by a destroyed house near the frontline village of Krymske, Luhansk region, in eastern Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 19.
       (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) After the ravages of the famine and World War II, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gifted the  Crimean  Peninsula to Ukraine as a gesture of goodwill. It meant nothing. ""It was all part of the Soviet Union. So, it was symbolic,"" said Taylor.  But, in 1986 the Soviet Union’s long stranglehold on Ukraine began to loosen as the credibility and strength of the socialist nation came under intense scrutiny by  Europe  and the rest of the world.  FOX NATION'S 'WHO CAN FORGET 1986?' RELIVES CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER ""The explosion of the nuclear reactor at  Chernobyl  was a devastating traumatic experience for Ukraine. It was a major embarrassment as well,"" said Global Affairs analyst Jonathan Wachtel.  The RBMK reactor explosion, a result of flawed reactor design, inadequately trained personnel, and resilience to free-flowing information by the Soviets, created an environmental catastrophe. Nuclear radiation was carried through the sky and land across Ukraine and into chunks of Europe.  The  impact of the explosion  on the health of Europeans is still not fully known to this day.    Video ""The Chernobyl disaster was one of the things that shook people’s confidence in the Soviet Union. And in the structure, the administrations, in the institutions. It was a failure. It was a failure of design, a failure of emergency management, it was a failure of trust."" Three years later, the Soviet Union collapsed. However, the former nation’s nuclear arsenal remained. CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION ""Ukraine had the largest number of these nuclear weapons on its soil,"" said Taylor. ""And the question was, what to do with these nuclear weapons?"" The  United States  subsequently sent an envoy to Kyiv to discuss the ruminations of nuclear conditions. But, what became of the nuclear stockpile? Were they handed over to the U.S.? Do they still remain in Ukraine? Or has Russia stockpiled them, along with other weapons, in their war against Ukraine?  To learn the full story, stream "" Ukraine Origins "" available now on  Fox Nation.

   As Russia’s war with Ukraine enters its second week more than 1 million refugees are spilling over the Western European embankment. It is the region's largest conflict since World War II and it has kicked off a wave of panic and anxiety that has spread across the globe.  This is likely what Putin wants. Why? RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Let’s take a look.  Russia has the military resources (conventional and asymmetric) to secure Ukraine decisively and quickly. This hasn’t happened. Here are three theories why:  1. Putin is pushing the pawns around like a chess master to ratcheting up the pressure and tension to strengthen his negotiating position.  By annexing the strategically important areas of Ukraine like Sevastopol in Crimea and rending the rest as an unarmed vassal state completely dependent on Russia for security Putin creates a Texas-sized buffer zone against an imagined future attack by NATO.     Video In this imagined war, most of the fighting and the resulting devastation would occur on the wide steppes of Ukraine rather than in Russian territory. The Dneiper river also makes for an ideal natural line of defense to stop a NATO army marching on Moscow. 2. Putin’s senior military leaders have bungled what could have been a quick victory and power grab.  They bought into their own propaganda that Ukraine and its people saw themselves as culturally Russian and wanted to be a part of Western Europe rather than a Russian-dominated East.  BIDEN SHOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO RUSSIAN PEOPLE, ASK THEM TO DENOUNCE PUTIN'S UKRAINE WAR They believed that they would walk into the country and be greeted as liberators from the pro-Western Zelensky government.       
      Ukraine's biggest national flag flies in Kyiv on Feb. 26, 2022.
       ( ) For this reason, they employed an armed force intended for a soft occupation rather than his most capable combat units. They also underestimated the will of the people of Ukraine to resist forced assimilation into the Russian sphere and the ability of their own troops to go from the mindset of,  ""We saving Ukraine!"" to, ""We are conquering Ukraine!""  Chechnya is just about two-thirds the size of New Hampshire and Russia fought a nearly 20-year war trying to prevent its independence after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.    There are many Ukrainians living in Russia and vice versa, this war has a stain of fratricide on it.  3. Putin deployed his military on the border expecting that the threat of invasion would scare Ukraine and the West into submission to his demands and when it didn't work his generals devised an ad hoc invasion to make good on their threat.

HELPING UKRAINE REFUGEES: NON PROFIT PROVIDES EMERGENCY WATER ACCESS FOR THOSE IN NEED The first scenario about is the most likely scenario given Putin’s record as a cold and calculated leader who has ambitions to restore Russia to its USSR size and glory. However, in just about any of these scenarios Ukraine is very likely to win in the end How come?  Because wars in this part of the 21st Century are no longer conventionally fought and won with the traditional army of tanks planes and infantry fighting battles. They are dispersed, asymmetric, and happen in the shadows of city streets and on the internet.  An interconnected economy means Putin faces sanctions in a modern world where global banking and supply chains can be turned off with a keyboard click rather than bombers destroying his factories and railroads and submarines sinking his merchant ships to cripple his ability to make war. ZELENSKYY SAYS IT'S A 'PITY' US SUPPORT CAME 'AFTER' RUSSIAN WAR BEGAN History has also taught us that a small motivated insurgency can outlast and beat back a much larger adversary. It’s why guerrilla warfare occurs so often in the world today. It’s because it works. A country like the United States may be able to extend the length of an insurgency but as we saw in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, they are all but impossible to defeat.    Video The only way is to occupy the entire country with a massive force that will get the edges dulled from a fiercely loyal insurgency with purpose (repel Russia). You then have to take complete control the food, water, electricity and heat for the entire population, so that you can strangle them for aiding the insurgency.  It's a brutal, medieval way of war and typically the harder it gets on the population, the more the insurgency forges into hard steel.  Chechnya is just about two-thirds the size of New Hampshire and Russia fought a nearly 20-year war trying to prevent its independence after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Conventional military operations lasted a year and then there was a nine-year active insurgency followed by a low-level insurgency that only ended in 2017. Upwards of 250,000 people died. Russia admitted to losing some 6,000 Russian soldiers but the actual number may be much higher.   Video Ukraine by comparison is the size of Texas and has a population of 44 million who so far have fought with great bravery and determination and may have inflicted as many as 3,000 casualties on Russia, in a week. The amount of damage a small determined insurgency can do was apparent to me when I was a young sniper on board the USS Cole, doing overwatch, noticing how two terrorists in a small boat almost sank a billion-dollar warship while it was in port. In the long grinding war of an insurgency, Russia faces years of killing Ukrainian civilians and insurgents along with the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers.  Given the number of Ukrainians living in Russia, its own territory is likely to see terrorist attacks again just as they also occurred during the Chechen conflict.       
      Thousands of Ukraine supporters marching to the White House.
       ( ) Putin’s only real choice is to push hard-lined negotiations followed by a complete force withdraw or risk being sucked into a dystopian war. His reputation, legacy, and the perception of Russia as a major power is at stake here, and pulling back bloody and beaten by Ukraine would be a devastating blow to all.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The die is cast and Russia will have to learn again the hard way about the modern way of insurgency warfare in the 21st century. This is why Ukraine eventually wins an irregular war but at what cost is yet to be seen.   ",2022-03

       Murkowski told Politico that banning Russian oil was the most significant tool the U.S. has left to throw at Russia. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked about what it would take to ban imports from Russia during Thursday's White House press briefing. ""What would need to happen in order to prompt a final decision on an oil ban?"" NBC's Kristen Welker asked.  ""I don't know if we look at it exactly through that prism ... We have not held back in taking significant, historic steps that are crippling the Russian economy right now,"" Psaki responded.  ""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people,"" she added. CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked if the administration has moved any closer to banning oil coming from Russia and Psaki said that she doesn't have an assessment on it. Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich also pressed Psaki on Russian oil imports.  ""During those years where it would take to bring down prices as you're saying, we should just continue to buy Russian oil?"" Heinrich asked.

""What this is all a reminder of in the president's view is our need to reduce our reliance on oil. Europeans need to do that, we need to do that.

51,"Iran nearing nuclear threshold, with US options to stop it narrowing, report warns",Adam Shaw,2022-03-03 15:39:00,"  close     Video   We're going to see a 'nuclear breakout' from Iran: Gen. Kellogg   Retired Lieut. Gen. Keith Kellogg discusses the implications of Biden administration lifting some sanctions from Iran and unfreezing billions in assets on 'Sunday Night in America.'  NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   FIRST ON FOX :  The Iranian regime  is closing in on the nuclear threshold, and the options available to the United States to stop Tehran from going nuclear are quickly narrowing, according to a new report released Thursday. The report by the Washington D.C., based Foundation for Defense of Democracies  (FDD) warns that the regime ""is approaching the point at which no outside power could prevent it from building nuclear weapons."" HOUSE REPUBLICANS WARN BIDEN AGAINST ANOTHER NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN ""As Tehran approaches that threshold, the United States will face an increasingly difficult choice between allowing the regime to cross over it or taking assertive measures – including potential military strikes – to stop Iran from going nuclear,"" the report by fellows Andrea Stricker and Anthony Ruggiero says. The report comes the same day as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it believes Iran has increased significantly its stockpile of highly enriched uranium – in breach of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which both the U.S. and Iran subsequently left. The Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018 over concerns that it didn’t do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. The U.S. pulled out and subsequently slapped a number of sanctions on Iran, which, in turn, increased its nuclear activity.

       The Biden administration has since tried to re-enter the deal and talks are  ongoing in Vienna  with diplomats from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia trying to bring Iran and the U.S. back into the deal. The FDD report warns that, with the talks being drawn out by Iran, it is giving the regime more room to position itself to reach the nuclear threshold. Already it has enough uranium to produce weapons-grade uranium for at least four nukes and is expanding ballistic missile programs that it could use as delivery vehicles. ""At present, if the regime decides to make its first nuclear weapon, it may need as little as three weeks to produce enough fissile material,"" it says. The authors also note the uncertainty from the incomplete intelligence reporting by the IAEA, which acts as the U.N.’s atomic watchdog. The Vienna-based agency said this week it has been unable to verify the exact size of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium due to limitations Tehran imposed on U.N. inspectors last year and that its monitoring and verification activities continue to be ""seriously affected"" by Iran's decision to stop letting inspectors access the agency's monitoring equipment. The FDD report says the 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), legitimized Iran’s advances toward the nuclear threshold, and while it prohibited weaponization, ""the deal’s weak monitoring and verification provisions made this irrelevant."" RET. GEN. KELLOGG: WE COULD SEE A ‘NUCLEAR BREAKOUT’ FROM IRAN Since President Biden took office, the report notes, Iran has been increasing its enrichment of uranium toward weapons-grade purity, and says that should have provoked a ""strong reaction"" from the Biden administration and the IAEA – but it did not.   Video ""By prolonging negotiations in Vienna, the Islamic Republic brought its breakout time close to zero while earning billions of dollars from oil exports thanks to Biden’s relaxation of sanctions as a goodwill gesture."" Now, the U.S. reportedly acknowledges that going back to the JCPOA’s ""breakout"" time of 7-12 months is not feasible, and it is more likely to be 6-9 months under a new deal – with the FDD report warning that an agreement that allows advanced centrifuges to remain would solidify that timeline. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAIVES SANCTIONS ON IRANIAN CIVILIAN NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES AS DEAL TALKS HANG IN BALANCE  The authors state that, with a rapidly advancing Iran combined with uncertainty surrounding its intentions and activities, Washington’s options are narrow. ""Amid this uncertainty, President Biden might have to choose between carrying out military strikes based on incomplete or conflicting information or acquiescing to Iran’s development of nuclear weapons,"" the report says. ""It would be preferable to keep Tehran far away from the threshold so that an American president never reaches this wrenching decision point."" It warns of a ""flawed premise"" shared by the Iran deal and the Biden administration that Iran can keep its uranium enrichment program while also being kept away from the nuclear threshold.  Instead, the authors argue, the U.S. should move to restore an international consensus that Iran cannot be trusted with an enrichment program, and launch an economic, financial and political pressure program to force it back to the negotiating table – a program that includes restoring all prior sanctions on Iran. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the meantime, the report says the U.S. should consider the use of cyber-attacks and sabotage campaigns on nuclear sites to delay Iran’s progress. ""The Biden administration should take all related measures necessary to ensure that the world’s most prolific state sponsor of terrorism can never reach the nuclear threshold,"" they argue.

   A senior defense official on Thursday said the U.S. continues to believe that  Russian forces  in the north of Ukraine are ""stalled,"" while other cities in the country remain under ""heavy"" shelling.  Ukraine has endured over a week's worth of bombardment by Russian troops, but Ukrainian forces continue to hold off major Russian advancements.

       (Chris McGrath/Getty Images) RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""We continue to see them resist and defend their territory and their resources quite effectively,"" the senior defense official said.  Roughly 90% of Russia's 150,000-strong force – built up along Ukraine’s border in the lead up to the invasion – is  believed to have entered Ukraine from the north, east and south. Despite repeated efforts by Russian forces to make it to Kyiv, a 40-mile-long convoy headed straight for the capital city has been stalled for three days. Reports have surfaced suggesting that everything from weather to mechanical errors have halted its progress and Russian troops remain roughly 15 to 20 miles outside of Kyiv. ""We certainly believe it is their intent to encircle the city from multiple directions,"" the senior defense official said. The official noted that Putin’s troops have not made significant advances in encroaching on the city.  However, they warned that just because Russia is advancing at a pace slower than originally believed ""doesn't mean that they aren't making any progress."" Heavy shelling has hit cities like Chernihiv and Kharkiv, located in the north of Ukraine, and over 480 Russian missiles have been levied throughout the country – hitting Ukrainian military points, government buildings and residential areas.

       (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) It remains unconfirmed how many deaths have been caused by the invasion, but the United Nations said that during the first five days of fighting 227 Ukrainian civilians were killed and 525 injured. Casualty numbers remain conflicted, however.  Ukraine's State Emergency Service  on Wednesday claimed that at least 2,000 Ukrainians had been killed, while the  foreign ministry  alleged that more than 5,800 Russian soldiers have perished.  Moscow  alleged  that roughly 500 Russian troops had died so far, along with 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers and ""nationalists."" PUTIN CLAIMS INVASION OF UKRAINE GOING ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE But it is not just the northern regions of Ukraine that are taking a beating. The city of Kherson, a Black Sea port that sits roughly 75 miles north of occupied Crimea, was reportedly invaded by Russian troops Wednesday, according to the city's Mayor Igor Kolykhayev. Roughly 300 people are believed to have been killed during the invasion and Kolykhayev said many of the bodies were  rendered unrecognizable  due to Russia's high-powered weapons. The U.S. senior defense official on Thursday said the U.S. could not ""independently"" confirm whether Russian forces had officially taken the city but noted that Russian troops in the south have not met the same ""challenges"" as those in the north. ""They launched these offenses in the south out of Crimea, where they have been occupying for eight years,"" the official said, noting that Russia already had built up infrastructure and a force presence in the region.

   Even Hamilton Beach couldn’t make enough mixers to keep up with the mixed messaging on Capitol Hill this week.  Congress  initially seemed divided about  COVID protocols  before  President Biden’s   State of the Union  speech. All  House  and  Senate  members were invited this year – compared to the 200 last year due to the pandemic. Initial guidelines dictated members had to sit spaced apart in the chamber. Even some members would sit in the gallery above rather than on the floor. No handshakes or backslapping. All members had to have a negative COVID test and wear a mask to take part. Democrats  hold the majority in the  House  and  Senate .  President Biden  is a Democrat. Democrats faced a conundrum. They’re trying desperately to ease the nation into some degree of normalcy and demonstrate a path out of the pandemic – especially ahead of the midterms. A fully-masked State of the Union speech would not present that optic.  In a memo, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker declared that lawmakers who refused to don a mask or adhere to other protocols risked getting kicked out of the speech.

       RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES We now live in the age of performative politics and  TikTok . One could only imagine how some GOP lawmakers would have  relished  the opportunity to make a scene getting bounced from the speech over COVID practices. Such dramatics would go viral and resonate in some conservative districts. Republicans would embrace casting blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who they criticize regularly for ""locking down the Capitol."" The House Ethics Committee has already fined Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., more than $100,000 for failing to wear a mask in the House chamber.  The Ethics Committee just announced this week that the Sergeant at Arms Office fined Greene for three violations alone on January 20. But the Capitol Attending Physician along with many other jurisdictions, began to dial back masking mandates on March 1, the day of the speech.  And so, no masks were required for State of the Union. Sure. A few wore masks on their own. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., ""because we all need to remember that the immunocompromised and those over 60 remain at higher risk of severe illness."" He said it was important to wear a mask ""for those who are vulnerable.""  Reps. Al Green, D-Tex., and Jim Langevin, D-R.I., were also spotted with masks. So, the State of the Union speech seemed and looked kind of normal. It wasn’t completely full. Congressional officials only permitted about 600 persons in the chamber. They can typically pack in 1,600 for a completely bulging State of the Union in a non-pandemic period.

       (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool via AP) WHITE HOUSE ASKS CONGRESS FOR $10B IN UKRAINE AID AS PUTIN'S BRUTAL WAR RATCHETS UP But everyone was back to handshakes and up-close chats. President Biden lingered in the chamber for 17 minutes after his remarks concluded, signing copies of the speech and talking with lawmakers. Unartfully, Democrats got the political optic they needed. But something else happened on State of the Union day which never unfolded before during the pandemic. A record six lawmakers tested positive for COVID. Reps. Dwight Evans, D-Penn., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., Ted Deutch, D-Fla. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., all tested positive. No more than two members ever tested positive on any one day during the entire pandemic. Granted, there may have been so many positive tests because members sought out tests to gain admittance to the speech. But six positives – just for members – is significant. Congress has proven itself to be a reliable barometer as to where the country stands with COVID. A spike in cases among members usually mirrors a spike in cases around the country. A good example came in December. Lawmakers began contracting COVID just before Christmas as the omicron wave spread. The numbers shot up on Capitol Hill in January, mimicking national coronavirus stats. Then the numbers dipped precipitously in Congress – matching the decline around the country.  Either way, the outbreak of cases, pitted against an unmasked speech, doesn’t mesh. Then there is the internal squabbling on both sides of the aisle which also sends mixed messages. Democrats find themselves at odds over addressing energy needs amid the war in  Ukraine . The price for a barrel of oil skyrocketed to $111 Wednesday.  Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. , is pushing for an increase in domestic oil production. Republicans are appropriating the Ukraine crisis to push the Biden Administration to approve pipeline construction and leases for drilling.  But there’s a schism. Manchin’s ideas run crossways with progressives and those pushing the Green New Deal. Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. , said she was disappointed President Biden didn’t address climate change in the speech. Senate Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,  sidestepped a question from yours truly when asked if Manchin’s energy ideas were problematic for the core of the Democratic Party.

We only get one percent of imports from  Russia ,"" said Schumer. ""The real problem with gas prices is gouging and monopolies. Democrats are focused on those two issues. We are focused very strongly. You’re going to hear a lot more from us on those issues in the future.""  But there was dissonance on the GOP side, too.  At the outset of the Cold War, late Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, R-Mich., said that foreign policy ""stopped at the water’s edge."" In today’s toxic political environment, the water’s edge qualifies as an EPA Superfund site.  Fox News  asked House Minority Leader  Kevin McCarthy,  R-Calif., if there was danger for the GOP to hypercriticize President Biden during an international crisis or if they could strike a balance. Especially for State of the Union. ""Are we going to sit down and be quiet? No,"" replied McCarthy. ""We’re not going to sit quietly by."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,  R-Ky., said there was ""broad support"" for President Biden’s approach to Ukraine. ""But what took him so long?""

Republicans and Democrats may disagree vehemently on a great many subjects – ranging from the riot at the Capitol to executive branch nominees. But after some initial grousing, Congress came together over Ukraine. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., was born in Ukraine under the Soviet regime in 1978.

   The Biden administration on Thursday appeared to split from its party after it said blocking  Russian oil imports  was not in its ""strategic interest"" as  Moscow pummels  Ukrainian cities.  Earlier this week,  GOP senators  introduced legislation that would bar the U.S. from importing any more Russian oil in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s continued assault on Ukraine.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Lisa Murkowski had garnered support on both sides of the aisle for a separate bill that would seek similar Russian oil bans.  ""I'm all for that. Ban it,"" Speaker of the House  Nancy Pelosi  told reporters Thursday. Though she added that she would not support a move to reopen drilling on federal lands. The U.S. and its Western allies have bombarded Russia’s economy with a litany of crippling sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Russian banks and businesses and social and government elites, including Putin.  Canada  went a step further and announced this weekend it would ban petroleum imports from Moscow in retaliation for Russia’s deadly invasion, a move more easily conceivable in Ottawa as it hasn’t  imported crude oil  from Russia since 2019. The U.S. imports the majority of its oil from Canada and Mexico with Russia accounting for just  3%  of all U.S. crude oil imports in 2021.  Despite the relatively low amount of petroleum imports, the White House has said no to an oil import ban, citing concerns of increased prices at the pump.

""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people,"" she added. ""And it's as simple as less supply raises prices, and that is certainly a big factor for the president at this moment."" Psaki argued that because barring oil imports may raise prices globally this could have an adverse effect and actually drive more income for Putin. It is unclear to what extent prices would be affected by blocking Russian oil imports but nations worldwide would need to take a more collective stance to effectively target Putin’s top moneymaker. Europe imports 40% of its energy needs from Russia, but top European Union officials argue they don’t need to block oil imports to target Putin’s oil revenue. The EU joined its Western allies in sanctioning Russia, which included banning any shared technologies with Russia on modernizing its refining abilities.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., is calling for an ""Operation Warp Speed"" project for U.S. domestic  energy  production, arguing the United States needs to speed up its energy exports much like how the federal government fast-tracked the development of life-saving  COVID-19  vaccines.  ""We need an Operation Warp Speed for how we permit energy projects – not just for traditional fuel, but also for nuclear and also for renewables,"" Cassidy told Fox News Digital in an interview. PELOSI FAVORS BANNING ALL RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES There's an urgency to boost domestic supplies because much of the world relies on energy from  Russia , which is waging a brutal war against Ukraine. There's  bipartisan support  to stop imports of Russian oil into the United States, but Europe relies heavily on Russian energy and can't easily turn off the spigot without having alternatives ready.     
      Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.
       (Reuters) ""They're going to need to buy gas from somebody besides the Russians, which means we have to increase production, as do others,"" Cassidy said. ""We need to compress the timeline by which we can approve pipelines, LNG (liquefied natural gas) export facilities, etc, so that we can actually get the gas to them as soon as possible."" Europe imports 40% of its energy needs from Russia, compared to less than 5% for the United States.  BIPARTISAN PRESSURE TO BAN RUSSIAN ENERGY IMPORTS GROWS ON BIDEN Cassidy intends to introduce his energy vision ""soon,"" but the gist is that the United States has to start thinking globally about its energy because it impacts the economy and international security.  The crisis is ""as existential as COVID"" for Ukraine and perhaps the world, Cassidy said, just hours before the largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine was on fire after getting  shelled by Russian forces .  The United States and Europe have already implemented major sanctions on Russia, which haven't stopped Vladimir Putin from his ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Now the conversations in Congress have turned to squeezing Russia in the energy sector as another way to stop the war.

Joe Manchin and Alaska Republican Sen.

He thought he could do it in a few days. He thought the Ukrainian people would welcome him. He believed his own propaganda and disinformation, which you just covered so well. And so, what's he left with? He's left with more devastation. And this follows kind of the playbook of the Russians. I mean, they've enabled serial episodes of mass homicide in the Syrian Civil War. And if you think back to Chechnya, the Chechnya interventions in the 1990s, Putin presided over the last one in 1999 where they essentially dealt with Chechnya rebels in Grozny by just leveling the city. So, I mean, there's tough times ahead for the Ukrainian people. They deserve all the support we can give them. But I don't think, you know, I don't think Russia could be able to accomplish its objectives, but he can certainly inflict a heck of a lot more pain and suffering and make what is already a humanitarian crisis much worse.

   Russia ’s cruel invasion of Ukraine has upended the global order. President Vladimir Putin’s war crimes make him an international pariah alongside the world’s worst autocrats like Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.  This dramatic change in our understanding of Putin means some U.S. policies must also change, specifically in Vienna as world powers try to revive the failed Iran nuclear deal. The U.S. and its European allies must walk away from the talks now before a new agreement revives and strengthens Putin’s ally Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM WARNS OF WORLD WAR III IF PUTIN, CHINA AND IRAN ‘GET AWAY WITH IT’     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin during their meeting in Moscow, Russia
       (Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Biden rightly proclaimed ""throughout our history, we’ve learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos; they keep moving."" Any new nuclear agreement recommended to the U.S. by, among others, Russia is inherently untrustworthy. The illogic—some might say foolhardiness—of relying on Putin’s Russia in the talks in Vienna after that same country and tyrant have invaded Ukraine without cause is striking. In Beijing a month ago, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping formalized an alliance in a remarkable meeting and jarring joint communique. They made it clear that the purpose of their partnership is to dislodge the U.S. from its leadership of the international order that created security and prosperity around the world for 75 years. Putin and Xi also redefined ""democracy"" to their benefit and freedom’s detriment. It is no longer a system like ours, they say, that is characterized by the rule of law, human rights, opportunity, and governments that govern with the consent of the governed. Rather, the Russian and Chinese definition of democracy is simply a government that works, regardless of whether its citizens have any freedom or economic opportunity. This is a direct global challenge to our founding values and form of government, which even though currently divided by partisanship, is infinitely preferable to their autocratic, kleptocratic, repressive regimes.

       (Photo by Alexei DruzhininTASS via Getty Images) To start the nuclear talks in Vienna, the U.S. accepted a demeaning demand from Iran that its representatives would not sit in the same room with representatives of the U.S. government. While the Europeans serve as intermediaries to bring the latest Iranian proposals to the American delegation, Russia and China are playing leading roles in bridging gaps as U.S. delegates wait at another hotel. But the Russians and Chinese do not wish us well—having recently declared ideological and geopolitical war on us—and that is one of the reasons the U.S. will not do well in any agreement that emerges from Vienna. Beyond the recent Putin-Xi union and the current war Russia started in Ukraine, our relations with Russia and China have become increasingly hostile: with Russia over its anti-American involvement in many places around the world, and its willingness to imprison or kill its political opponents. China’s repression of the Uyghurs and Hong Kongers, its unfair international economic activities, and its threats to democratic Taiwan have put it in conflict with the U.S.   Video It is not surprising, therefore, that Russia and China have both become partners of the anti-American government in Tehran. Russia has joined forces with Iran and Syria against the Syrian people bringing about the deaths of more than a half million Syrians and tangibly supports Iran’s military. China circumvents our sanctions laws and illegally buys billions of dollars of oil from Iran annually. Russia and China are thoroughly biased participants in the negotiations in Vienna, not neutral mediators, yet we remain dependent upon them. How can the American people possibly trust an agreement with Iran that Putin and Xi helped shape to their liking? How can we put our trust in the leaders of a country like Iran that continues to attack our allies in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as well as American military installations in the region, threatens Israel with nuclear obliteration, and enriches uranium and builds missiles in violation of the previous nuclear agreement? How can we imagine that an agreement that is supposedly in our security interest and that of our allies could possibly emerge from such an unfair negotiation with such an untrustworthy country?

Iran’s nuclear enrichment, long-range missile development, and support of terrorism must end.

   Developments this week indicate  Russia is losing  the  information war  at home, and  President Vladimir Putin  is not able to fully control the narrative surrounding his  invasion of Ukraine .  Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told Fox News Digital that it might be a bit of a stretch to say that Russia is ""clearly"" losing the information war, but signs indicate there is definitely ""trouble.""  ""A few days ago … the official Russian censorship agency came out with a warning to all media outlets that said ‘only trustworthy sources are allowed to be used when reporting on this special military operation, and if you don’t do that we will take you off-air,’"" which led to the forced  closure of two independent news networks , including Dozhd TV – known in English as Rain TV.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Tikhon Dzyadko, overnight chief editor of Dozhd, wrote on Telegram on Wednesday that he was fleeing the country over fear for his life, saying it was ""obvious that the personal safety of some of us is now under threat.""

   I have never wanted to be so wrong in my life. On March 7, 2014, I created the Facebook group called ""1,000,000 people around the world in support of  Ukraine ’s fight for freedom.""   I created it initially to help raise awareness of the annexation of  Crimea  and to fight the information war against the Russia propaganda that, back then, was being accepted as truth much more than it is today.  I like to think we played a small role in that.   I had hoped that once Americans understood why Ukraine was important, that we would intervene to help Ukraine get her  territorial integrity  restored. Unfortunately that never happened. Now the group I founded is now growing by leaps and bounds but tragically for the wrong reasons because of the all-out war in Ukraine. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  I’m a first generation Ukrainian-American.  I am a lifelong New Jersy resident, father, and a student of military history, specifically World War II.

       My family was forced to move to Poland from Ukraine prior to World War II, and is of Lemko origin.  I’ve always been extremely proud of my heritage and my people. I founded the group after watching the shootings of the Heavenly Hundred on the Maidan on February 22, 2014 and the takeover of Belbek (the military base in Crimea) without a shot being fired.

       ( ) After a week of fighting the world has seen that the Ukrainian army is much stronger than most expected.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has vastly underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, he is not just fighting the regular army but the entire nation.    According to the Wall Street Journal, fifteen percent of the armed forces fighting in Ukraine right now are female. Videos of true heroism are all over the place.  The legendary ""Ghost of Kyiv"" is real and not merely a legend.  President Zelenskyy has become a hero to not only his people but to the free world. Ukrainians are fighting not only for themselves but for all of us.   Video The United States was part of an agreement more than 25 years ago called the Budapest Memorandum that obligates not only America, but several other nations (including Russia!) to come to the defense of Ukraine if their territorial integrity was violated.  This was done in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons in 1994, the third-largest in the world at that time. UKRAINE WILL ULTIMATELY WIN THE IRREGULAR WAR WITH RUSSIA Now that the country is facing an existential threat what has happened? As a Ukrainian-American I can tell you that Ukrainians don’t want troops on the ground, but airstrikes against lethal weapons that go against the Geneva Convention, including TOS-1A’s (thermobaric rocket launchers) are crucial, as well as a no-fly zone to protect against constant aerial bombardment.   Video TOS-1A’s are devastating weapons that cannot be defended against. They essentially are napalm rockets that basically suck oxygen out of the air and vaporize people.    Is the free world prepared to witness massive amount of civilian deaths? The Ukrainian army can try to fight this conventionally, but are dealing with a force of evil, Putin, who will destroy Ukraine if he can’t conquer or subjugate it. Civilian deaths will start to mount significantly in the coming days.

99,How dangerous was Russia's nuclear plant strike?,Associated Press,2022-03-04 08:14:00,"  close     Video   Russia captures Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant   Russian military forces have taken control of a major nuclear power plant in Lviv, Ukraine, Fox News' Jonathan Hunt reports. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Europe's  largest nuclear power plant was hit by  Russian  shelling early Friday,  sparking a fire  and raising fears of a disaster that could affect all of central Europe for decades, like the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown. Concerns faded after  Ukrainian  authorities announced that the fire had been extinguished, and while there was damage to the reactor compartment, the safety of the unit was not affected. But even though the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is of a different design than Chernobyl and is protected from fire, nuclear safety experts and the International  Atomic Energy Agency  warn that waging war in and around such facilities presents extreme risks. One major concern, raised by Ukraine's state nuclear regulator, is that if fighting interrupts power supply to the nuclear plant, it would be forced to use less-reliable diesel generators to provide emergency power to operating cooling systems. A failure of those systems could lead to a disaster similar to that of Japan's Fukushima plant, when a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 destroyed cooling systems, triggering meltdowns in three reactors.     
      This image made from a video released by Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant shows bright flaring object landing in grounds of the nuclear plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine Friday, March 4, 2022. 
       (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant via AP) RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES The consequence of that, said Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , would be widespread and dire. ""If there is an explosion, that's the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe,"" he said in an emotional speech in the middle of the night, calling on nations to pressure Russia's leadership to end the fighting near the plant. ""Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops. Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station."" WHAT HAPPENED? After taking the strategic port city of Kherson, Russian forces moved into the territory near Zaporizhzhia and attacked the nearby city of Enerhodar to open a route to the plant late Thursday. It was not immediately clear how the power plant was hit, but Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said a Russian military column had been seen heading toward the nuclear facility and that loud shots were heard in the city. Later Friday, Ukrainian authorities said Russia had taken over the nuclear plant. Plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that early Friday morning, shells fell directly on the facility and set fire to one of its six reactors. Initially, firefighters were not able to get near the flames because they were being shot at, Tuz said. After speaking with Ukrainian authorities on Friday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said a building next to the reactors was hit and not a reactor itself. ""All of the safety systems of the six reactors at the plant were not affected at all and there has been no release of radioactive material,"" he said. ""However, as you can imagine, the operator and the regulator have been telling us that the situation naturally continues to be extremely tense and challenging.""     
      IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi speaks at a press conference about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine in Vienna, Austria, Friday, March 4, 2022. 
       (AP Photo/Lisa Leutner) MILA KUNIS, A 'PROUD UKRAINIAN, AND HUSBAND ASHTON KUTCHER LAUNCH FUNDRAISER TO MATCH $3 MILLION IN DONATIONS Earlier this week, Grossi already had warned that the IAEA was ""gravely concerned"" with Russian forces conducting military operations so close nearby. ""It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them,"" he said. WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED? The reactor that was hit was offline, but still contains highly radioactive nuclear fuel. Four of the other six reactors have now been taken offline, leaving only one in operation. The reactors at the plant have thick concrete containment domes, which would have protected them from external fire from tanks and artillery, said Jon Wolfsthal, who served during the  Obama administration  as the senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council. At the same time, a fire at a nuclear power plant is never a good thing, he said. ""We don't want our nuclear power plants to come under assault, to be on fire, and to not have first responders be able to access them,"" he said. Another danger at nuclear facilities are the pools where spent fuel rods are kept to be cooled, which are more vulnerable to shelling and which could cause the release of radioactive material. Perhaps the biggest issue, however, is the plant's power supply, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the  University of Southern California  who has studied both the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, raising a concern also voiced by Wolfsthal and others.

       (REUTERS/Stringer) UKRAINIAN MP WARNS KYIV WILL ‘NEXT ALEPPO,' CALLS ON WEST TO STEP UP AS HORRIFIC IMAGES EMERGE The loss of off-site power could force the plant to rely on emergency diesel generators, which are highly unreliable and could fail or run out of fuel, causing a station blackout that would stop the water circulation needed to cool the spent fuel pool, he said. ""That is my big — biggest concern,"" he said. David Fletcher, a University of Sydney professor in its School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, who previously worked at UK Atomic Energy, noted that even shutting down the reactors would not help if the cooling system failed in such a way. ""The real concern is not a catastrophic explosion as happened at Chernobyl but damage to the cooling system which is required even when the reactor is shut down,"" he said in a statement. ""It was this type of damage that led to the Fukushima accident."" WHAT CONCERNS REMAIN? Ukraine is heavily reliant on nuclear energy, with 15 reactors at four stations that provide about half the country's electricity. In the wake of the attack on Zaporizhzhia, U.S.  President Biden , British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others called for an immediate end to the fighting there. Following a conversation with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, IAEA Director Grossi appealed to all parties to ""refrain from actions"" that could put Ukraine's nuclear power plants in danger. I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO LEAD THE FIGHT FOR UKRAINE'S FREEDOM Shmyhal called on western nations to close the skies over the country's nuclear plants. ""It is a question of the security of the whole world!"" he said in a statement. Ukraine is also home to the former Chernobyl nuclear plant, where radioactivity is still leaking, which was taken by Russian forces in the opening of the invasion after a fierce battle with the Ukrainian national guards protecting the decommissioned facility. In an appeal to the IAEA for help earlier this week, Ukrainian officials said that Chernobyl staff have been held by the Russian military without rotation and are exhausted. Grossi earlier this week appealed to Russia to let the Chernobyl staff ""do their job safely and effectively."" During fighting on the weekend, Russian fire also hit a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv and a similar facility in Kharkiv. Both contained low-level waste such as those produced through medical use, and no radioactive release has been reported, but Grossi said the incidents should serve as a warning. ""The two incidents highlight the risk that facilities with radioactive material may suffer damage during the armed conflict, with potentially severe consequences,"" he said. James Acton, the co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the simple key to keeping the facilities safe was to immediately end any military operations around them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Under normal circumstances, the likelihood of a reactor losing power and of the emergency diesel generators being damaged and of not being repaired adequately quickly is very, very small,"" Acton said. ""But in a war, all of these different failures that would have to happen for a reactor to become damaged and meltdown — the likelihood of all of those happening becomes much more likely than it does in peacetime."" Mitsuru Fukuda, a professor at Nihon University in Tokyo and expert on crisis management and security, said the Zaporizhzhia attack raises broader questions for all countries. ""Many of us did not expect a respected country’s military would take such an outrageous step,"" he said. ""Now that (Russian President Vladimir)  Putin  has done it, not only Ukraine but the international community, including Japan, should reevaluate the risk of having nuclear plants as potential wartime targets.""

   The already challenging path to bringing home Americans jailed in  Russia  and  Ukraine  is likely even more complicated now with a war overwhelming the region and increasingly hostile relations between the  United States  and the Kremlin. Marine  veteran  Trevor Reed  and corporate security executive Paul Whelan are each serving lengthy prison sentences in Russia, but their families have long held out hope for some sort of deal — including a possible prisoner exchange — that could get their loved ones home. Now, though, that seems a much harder ask. ""I can’t help but think that this is not going to help Trevor get released sooner, obviously,"" Reed's mother, Paula Reed, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

       (AP Photo/LM Otero, File) MAKSIM CHMERKOVSKIY ON LEAVING UKRAINE: ‘I FEEL GUILTY’ The war with Ukraine has not only occupied global attention, but it has also led to punishing economic sanctions by the U.S. and escalating Russian aggression in the face of international condemnation over its invasion. Though the conflict has not closed off avenues for bringing home Reed and Whelan, the prospect of concessions by either side anytime soon is eclipsed by the likelihood of continued antagonism by Russia. ""If this becomes long and drawn out, and they take over Ukraine, then the Western countries and the United States are going to be at odds with Russia for a long time,"" said Reed's father, Joey Reed. ""That could lead to additional charges against our son, if he lives, and keep him there indefinitely, which is not uncommon in Russia."" He said he was particularly concerned about a loss of communications between the two superpowers that could foreclose any possibility of the U.S. government getting him home. ""We've been told that even during the Cold War, they kept channels open. Even Kennedy was able to talk to Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis,"" Reed said. ""Anyone that's advocating for closing embassies and cutting them off, that's a gigantic mistake when two major nuclear powers are not speaking and are at odds with each other."" State Department principal deputy press spokeswoman Jalina Porter, asked by the AP Thursday about how the war affected the cases of all three men, said only that the administration’s top priority is the ""safety and security of all Americans,"" including Reed and Whelan. ""This is something that the secretary works on day in and day out,"" she said. KAMALA HARRIS SLAMMED FOR FOCUS ON EQUALITY ACT AMID RUSSIA INVASION: ‘THIS IS WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT’ Reed, who is from  Texas , was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2020 on charges that he assaulted  police officers  who were driving him to a police station after picking him up following a night of heavy drinking at a party. He has struggled with  health issue s behind bars, most recently coughing up blood this week, his father said. He is regarded by the  U.S. government  as a wrongful detainee, as is Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage-related charges that his family says are entirely bogus. Whelan's sister, Elizabeth, said she's been ""doom-scrolling"" news about the war on Twitter like everyone else, concerned about the impact of the war on her brother and the possibility of another ""Iron Curtain"" falling in the region. She said the U.S. could use the conflict as a fresh opportunity to press for the release of Reed and Whelan by making it a condition of any lifting of the sanctions against Russia, though it is not clear that that would happen.

""I can't imagine that all of these oligarchs whose families are now being affected, whose assets and goods are now being affected, wouldn't consider the release of Paul and Trevor a very small price to pay in order to get some relief themselves,"" Whelan said. Ukraine, meanwhile, is holding  North Dakota  farmer Kurt Groszhans, accused in a plot to assassinate a current member of the country's political cabinet. His family and supporters say the charges are trumped up, and were designed to silence Groszhan's own allegations of government corruption in Ukraine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kristi Magnusson, Groszhan's sister, said in a statement provided to AP that she was concerned that the State Department was not ""advocating for his release because it would be inferring that Ukraine is engaged in corrupt activities right at a time when State is focused on being as supportive as possible of Ukraine against the Russians. ""We support the Ukrainian people against Russia as well, but our brother is a sitting duck in that prison and we need him to be released so at least he can try to survive on his own,"" she added. Unlike Reed and Whelan, the U.S. has not designated Groszhans as a wrongful detainee.  ",2022-03

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine  is the largest conflict that Europe has seen since World War II, with  Russia  conducting a multi-pronged offensive across the country.

Here is a look at some of the weapons being used in the conflict. RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATE

       (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service photo via AP) WARPLANES AND MISSILES The Russian military has used warplanes and Kalibr (Caliber) cruise missiles to hit facilities throughout the country. The Kalibr is a precision weapon, but Ukrainian military facilities and government buildings apparently targeted by those missiles in Kyiv and Kharkiv are located close to residential areas, resulting in civilian casualties. The same applies to missiles carried by Russian warplanes, which targeted military infrastructure in strikes that also involved collateral damage. To hit key targets, the Russian military also has used Iskander missiles that have a range of up to 500 kilometers (around 300 miles) and carry a much more powerful warhead that can destroy big buildings and some fortified facilities. Some Iskander missiles were reportedly fired from the territory of Russian ally Belarus, which has served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  and other officials have accused the Russian military of indiscriminately shelling residential buildings, schools and hospitals around the country.

The Soviet-designed Grad (Hail), Smerch (Tornado) and Uragan (Hurricane) multiple rocket launchers are designed to fire a salvo of powerful rockets to destroy concentrations of troops or military equipment. Their use against populated areas inevitably causes heavy casualties and major damage to civilian infrastructure. The Russian military also has a wide range of powerful Soviet-designed artillery units, which were bizarrely named after flowers, such as self-propelled 203-mm Peony and 152-mm Hyacinth and Acacia self-propelled howitzers. Moscow has claimed it was only targeting military bases and infrastructure, but the AP has documented massive damage to civilian infrastructure and residential areas in Kyiv, Kharkiv and numerous other cities and towns across Ukraine. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainian forces have widely deployed heavy weapons in residential areas to use civilians as shields, a claim that couldn't be independently verified. The  U.N.  human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, speaking at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Thursday, said ""most civilian casualties were caused by the use of heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and air strikes in populated areas, with concerning reports of use of cluster munitions striking civilian targets.""

       (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP) Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of using cluster munitions, accusations the Kremlin has denied. Such weapons are designed to target enemy troops and weapons over a broad area, and their use in populated areas inevitably would lead to mass casualties among civilians. Cluster bombs , rockets and artillery shells open in the air, releasing submunitions, or ""bomblets,"" that are dispersed over a large area and simultaneously hit multiple targets. Beyond the initial impact, bomblets have a high rate of failure to explode, posing a long-time threat of killing and maiming people for a long time after they were fired. Thermobaric weapons consist of a fuel container and two separate explosive charges, with the first detonating to disperse the fuel particles and the second igniting the dispersed fuel and oxygen in the air, creating a blast wave of extreme pressure and heat that creates a partial vacuum in an enclosed space. That makes the weapon particularly deadly for people in an enclosed space. LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLS ON RUSSIANS TO ASSASSINATE PUTIN: ‘THE ONLY WAY THIS ENDS’ The Pentagon has said that Russian mobile launchers for thermobaric weapons were spotted inside Ukraine, but couldn't confirm their use. The Ukrainian military has relied on the same assortment of Soviet-built multiple rocket launchers and howitzers that the Russian military has. It doesn't possess sophisticated long-range precision weapons like Russia's Iskander ballistic missiles and Kalibr cruise missiles.

   The conflict in Ukraine ""heightens the risk"" of war between China and the U.S., a political science professor told Fox News.  Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts University, said China could take action in Taiwan while the U.S. is distracted with Russia's siege on Ukraine. He said conflict between the U.S. and China would most likely break out if the authoritarian superpower were to take military action in Taiwan. ""The United States and China, I think, are at very high risk of conflict,"" Beckley, the co-author of the upcoming book ""Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China,"" told Fox News. ""Not just economic competition or ideological competition, but an actual war."" Beckley told Fox News that a slowing Chinese economy, rising sentiments of Taiwanese independence and increasing international pressure to contain China’s growth make conflict more likely.

""The Russia conflict plays into this because of course it’s a big distraction for the United States.""  In October, President Biden  pledged to defend Taiwan if China attacked .  The U.S., under the Taiwan Relations Act, provides defensive weapons to Taiwan, but it is not obligated to provide military support if China were to invade.     
      President Xi
       (Huang Jingwen/Xinhua via AP)) Beckley told Fox News that the conflict in Ukraine limits the resources the U.S. can dedicate to protecting Taiwan from China. ""If Russia and China are each fighting back-to-back in their own regions, that's going to overstretch American forces, give them each opportunities to make inroads in their own regions and I think heightens the risk of a conflict over something like Taiwan this decade,"" Beckley told Fox News.  Beckley also noted that  Russia  and  China  share mutual interests based ""based on geopolitics, on energy, and on a common ideological aversion to the current international system.""  Beckley called trade between the two nations a ""natural partnership based on an absolutely vital commodity."" China imports over 80% of the  oil  and natural gas that it consumes and over half of Russia’s government revenue stems from selling gas and oil to foreign countries, according to Beckley.  The two countries also share an interest in ""pushing back against the liberal international order that the United States and its mostly democratic allies sustain,"" Beckley said. The Chinese-Russian relationship features an ""asymmetry in power"" based on China’s military and economic might, according to Beckley.  ""China’s  economy  is 10 times the size of Russia’s,"" Beckley told Fox News. ""China spends four times as much every year on its military as Russia does, and China is really a multi-dimensional, great power."" ""As a result, Russia is always worried of becoming the junior partner in the relationship, and China is always worried that it will give more than it gets,"" Beckley continued.

       (Alexei DruzhininTASS via Getty Images) Beckley added that there are schisms in Russia and China’s geopolitical interests including border disputes, Central Asian spheres of influence and historical hostilities. Chinese financial interests counter Beijing’s diplomatic support of Russia, according to Beckley. Chinese banks have ""walked back"" some of their transactions with Russia in ""basic, tacit compliance"" with recent sanctions.  ""China, on the one hand, wants to support Russia but is not willing to go to the full extent as an ally would because it worries that it'll get cut off from the Western economic system and invite hostility towards itself,"" Beckley told Fox News.  China has not imposed sanctions on Russia,  according to Reuters .  Beckley told Fox News that there are three strategic rationales for this policy.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "" First of all, I think the Chinese are worried that if they are to make moves on Taiwan or to get more aggressive or simply a spark the ire of the United States and its allies, they too could be subject to similar sanctions,"" Beckley said. ""And so they want to start undermining the legitimacy of this sort of ganging up on a great power.""

   The  World Health Organization (WHO)  warned this week that the  conflict  in  Ukraine  could lead to increased  COVID-19  transmission.  Speaking at a Wednesday news briefing, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said  Ukraine had experienced a surge of cases before  Russia's  invasion.  UKRAINE NUCLEAR AUTHORITY GIVES UPDATE ON ZAPORIZHZHIA POWER PLANT: NOW IN RUSSIAN HANDS Low rates of testing, he said, mean there is likely to be a significant undetected transmission of the  virus  and – coupled with low  vaccination  coverage – the increased risk of ""large numbers of people developing severe  disease ."" ""Mass population movements are likely to contribute further to transmission of COVID-19, potentially increasing pressure on  health  systems in neighboring countries,"" Tedros noted.  ""Anytime you disrupt society like this, and put literally millions of people on the move, infectious diseases will exploit that,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said.  ""[People are] highly susceptible to the impacts ... of being infected themselves, and it's much more likely that disease will spread,"" he noted. Ryan said there's ""no question"" that COVID-19 will exploit that ""in the coming weeks.""  United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a  statement Thursday that 1 million people have fled Ukraine in just seven days. ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one,"" he said.  Tedros also tweeted that the WHO is providing health assistance to these refugees on the ground in Poland, Romania and Moldova. The WHO has  released  $5.2M from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies and launched an  appeal  for $45 million for ongoing support in Ukraine and $12.5 million to support neighboring countries to care for refugees.  COVID-INFECTED PATIENTS AT RISK FOR 20 TYPES OF HEART AND VASCULAR DISEASE: STUDY It  estimates  that 12 million people inside Ukraine will need relief and protection, while more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees may need the same in neighboring countries in the coming months. COVID-19 transmission is not the only major health concern, and images show young children being treated in Kyiv hospital  basements  to escape the shelling.  The WHO has called for critical medical supplies to safely reach those who need them, and Tedros  noted  that at least three major oxygen plants in Ukraine have closed.  In a  statement , Tedros and Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, the WHO regional director for  Europe , wrote that life-saving medicinal oxygen supplies in Ukraine are ""nearing a very dangerous point.""  ""Trucks are unable to transport oxygen supplies from plants to hospitals across the country, including the capital Kyiv. The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours,"" the doctors said in a Feb. 27 statement. ""Some have already run out. This puts thousands of lives at risk.""

It’s more of like a security feature after 9/11.

   FIRST ON FOX:  A new nuclear agreement with  Iran  is expected within days, a European diplomat told Fox News on Friday – coming after weeks of renewed talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The diplomat cautioned, however, that any deal involving Iran, China, Russia, and the U.S. could always unravel. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Iran’s chief negotiator told reporters that a deal would be done within 24-48 hours. IRAN NEARING NUCLEAR THRESHOLD, WITH US OPTIONS TO STOP IT NARROWING, REPORT WARNS  The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) set limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for a significant rollback of international sanctions. The Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the deal amid concerns that the agreement did not do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions -- including the sunset clauses on restrictions. Iran eventually pulled out of the deal after the Trump administration re-imposed sanctions as part of its maximum pressure campaign, and Tehran has been ramping up its enrichment since then. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said this week it believes Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but that it is unable to verify the exact size of the stockpile due to limits imposed on inspectors by the regime. The Biden administration has sought to re-enter the deal and  talks began in Vienna  last year to revive the deal. Those talks initially stalled amid demands for significant sanctions relief by Iran’s hard line regime.  As for the question of Russian diplomats negotiating in Vienna during a European flight embargo on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the diplomat told Fox that there can always be exceptions for diplomats.   Video With Russia’s involvement in the deal, it raises the possibility of financial benefit for Moscow in a new deal, like payments to take Iranian uranium. The diplomat told Fox that the West will find a way to enable the deal, and says the concerns are ""nothing that can’t be overcome."" BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAIVES SANCTIONS ON IRANIAN CIVILIAN NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES AS DEAL TALKS HANG IN BALANCE The State Department did not comment when asked whether the Biden administration has concerns about needing Russia’s cooperation or having to carve out sanctions to enable to agreement.  Last month, Secretary of State  Antony Blinken  signed a waiver that restored the ability of foreign companies and other countries to participate in civilian nuclear and safety projects in Iran without facing U.S. sanction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A senior State Department official told Fox News Digital at that time that the waivers were due to growing non-proliferation concerns with respect to increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium by Tehran, and that without the waiver, ""detailed technical discussions with third parties regarding disposition of stockpiles and other activities of nonproliferation value cannot take place.""

""They did it in Chechnya, attacked multiple hospitals in the capital during the war in there 20 years ago."" ""More recently, in Syria, they targeted hospitals in Idlib, in the northwest, in Aleppo and destroyed many hospitals,"" Rubenstein added. The United Nations  found  that ""pro-government"" forces in Syria carried out aerial and ground attacks in 2020 on civilian markets, refugee camps, and most notably hospitals. The attacks on civilian populations included the use of cluster munitions, similar to the Russian use of cluster munitions on Ukrainian civilian areas, according to the report. Cluster munitions are explosives that contain smaller bombs. They can strike wide areas and raze entire civilian neighborhoods.

They waited and waited and finally, they couldn't wait any longer. And so this is why Joe Biden is such a failure as president in foreign policy.

The battle for Kyiv will decide the course of the war and set Europe’s security challenges for a generation. Putin's model of glory is the 1945 Red Army conquest of Hitler's Berlin. As the Red Army wiped away Nazis in World War II, so Putin want to see his armies to sweep across Ukraine.  This is a delusional conquest.  There are no Nazis in Ukraine.  Ukraine is full of patriots who want democracy.      
      Vladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after TIME magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader. 
       (Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) The city fight is familiar ground for Putin. He craves this battle. Twisted Putin thinks he will become greater than Lenin and Khrushchev by standing up for Russia and taking back all of Ukraine. World opinion on casualties won’t affect him. A Russian flag over smoking rubble is his goal.  BIDEN SHOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO RUSSIAN PEOPLE, ASK THEM TO DENOUNCE PUTIN'S UKRAINE WAR President Biden and Europe and the world have at most a few days left to make sure Ukraine's fighting forces are supplied for what lies ahead.  It may soon be down to hours.  Tanks are already probing Kyiv suburbs. At some point, the Russian convoy north of Kyiv will move down to encircle the city.

       (REUTERS/Maksim Levin) First, Ukraine must keep a supply route open out to the west even under attack.  Fighting for Kyiv will consume Ukraine’s weapons and supplies, fast.  Ukraine’s armed forces claim they’ve destroyed many Russian tanks and vehicles, which is good, but it also means they are using up Javelin anti-tank missiles. The U.S. and NATO should do whatever it takes to help Ukraine hold airfields and roads in Ukraine’s west.  Few Russian forces are in that area so far. Next, Ukraine says they are going on the counter-offensive.  As the Russian convoy north of Kyiv moves south, they must pick their targets carefully.  Yes, Ukraine should strike Russian tanks, but their overall aim should be to break up and harass Russian formations by hitting resupply vehicles, too.  AFTER UKRAINE INVASION, U.S. SHOULD WALK AWAY FROM NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN Ukraine can also disrupt Russian command and control.  For example, that Russian supply convoy north of Kyiv has a mobile command post, with officers near it, and a known electronic signature squawking out even if they try to mask it. All are targets.    Video Of course, Ukrainian forces will find their own communications disrupted by street-to-street fighting around buildings and by Russian electronic warfare. The U.S. and NATO can help, with links to up to satellites, drones or other radio relays to stay in contact.  The one thing that would stop Putin from taking Kyiv is a strong no-fly zone. All week Zelensky and his officials have repeatedly asked NATO for help to ""close the skies."" The answer’s been no.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER If Kyiv is encircled, it’s not over.  Ukraine’s defenders may end up attacking Russian forces in the city while other Ukrainian forces hit the siege lines from outside.    Video Senior Russian commanders know in their bones that a pitched fight in Kyiv will be hell.  The Russian army in 1942-1943 swallowed up entire German divisions at Stalingrad.  Today’s Russian generals had grandfathers and great-grandfathers in that fight.  Their defense of Stalingrad was glorious.  Now the tables are turned.  The Russians invading Ukraine are on the wrong side morally – and tactically.  If NATO keeps helping, Russia will lose the city fight.

   Russian state  media  is spreading misinformation about the location of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in what analysts said is an attempt to discourage resistance fighters and erode support for Ukraine around the globe. A story published by the Russian News Agency Tass this week quoted a Russian lawmaker saying Zelenskyy ""hastily fled"" Kyiv for Lviv in far western  Ukraine , despite photos and video clips showing him leading Ukraine's defense from its capital.     
      In this Feb. 27, 2022, photo taken from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to the nation in Kyiv, Ukraine. 
       (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP, File) It's one of many distorted claims to emerge from a Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign that aims to strengthen domestic support for the invasion and undermine the resolve of Ukrainians. But the same tactics that have sustained such propaganda for years are running into a far more complex reality where the claims can be instantly and credibly rebutted on social media. Videos and photos of Zelenskyy in Kyiv have quickly become some of the defining images of the invasion, rallying support for Ukraine at home and abroad and challenging Russia's attempt to control public perception. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  By claiming he's fled Kyiv, Russia hopes to undermine Zelenskyy's status as a Ukrainian hero while also suggesting legitimate sources of news and information can't be trusted, according to Sarah Oates, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies Russian propaganda. To Oates, it's a move that smacks of desperation by a Russian propaganda machine that can't compete with viral images of Ukrainian defiance. ""They're flailing. They've been doing this for decades, and they have a very well-oiled delivery system, but right now their content just isn't working,"" Oates said. ""The Ukrainians may be completely outgunned by traditional military, but they are winning the propaganda war.""

       (Presidency of Ukraine/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Some of the most popular posts falsely claiming Zelenskyy has fled are clearly aimed at an international audience. The news outlet Sputnik ran translated versions of the story not only in English and Spanish but also Portuguese and Vietnamese. A Spanish-language TikTok video created by Sputnik — set to the grooves of the American band Twenty One Pilots — has racked up more than 2.3 million views. Zelenskyy has declined American offers to help him evacuate the city. ""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" Zelenskyy said last week, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. BIDEN SHOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO RUSSIAN PEOPLE, ASK THEM TO DENOUNCE PUTIN'S UKRAINE WAR Despite the evidence that Zelenskyy remains in Kyiv, Sputnik and Tass have not removed their claims or added corrections. The story has also been republished in Italy, India and China. The false story began spreading on Twitter on Friday when George Papadopoulous, a former aide to ex-President  Donald Trump , posted a link to the claim in an Italian publication. Papadopoulos served prison time for lying to the FBI during its investigation into Russia's meddling on behalf of Trump in the 2016 election. ""Breaking: Zelensky, after saying he would not abandon Ukraine, has fled the country,"" Papadopoulous tweeted. He did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Friday. Claims that Zelenskyy has abandoned the capital aren't the only narratives Russia is trying to use to lower Ukrainian morale, according to Roman Osadchuk, a Ukraine-based analyst with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. He said Russian forces have also tried to spread claims that Ukraine has surrendered. Early in the  invasion , a fake account said to be controlled by Zelenskyy appeared on the platform Telegram telling Ukrainians to surrender to the invaders. ""Attacking morale seems to be really important for the Russian forces,"" Osadchuk said Friday during an online discussion about the conflict.

       (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) After the  European Union’s  president called for a ban on Russian state media, a wave of tech companies blocked the channels from their platforms within the EU. They include Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as TikTok and Google, the owner of YouTube. TikTok, which boasts more than one billion users worldwide, has emerged as perhaps the leading front in the information war that's running parallel to the military invasion, according to Ciaran O'Connor, an analyst who researches online disinformation at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue. TikTok's loose content moderation policies when compared to Facebook or YouTube make it a more effective means of spreading misinformation and propaganda. One favored tactic used by Russian state media is to highlight pro-Russian comments from Western leaders to divide its opponents, O'Connor said. For example, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti uploaded a TikTok video clip this week featuring Trump's recent praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It has been viewed more than 4 million times.

   On a day when  NATO's  Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg once again  ruled out a no-fly zone for Ukraine , a new suggestion for a humanitarian no-fly zone has been floated by NATO’s former supreme allied commander in  Europe , retired Gen. Philip Breedlove.  Breedlove told Fox News Digital that something more has to be done to help the Ukrainian people against Russia’s ongoing military offensive. Breedlove, a retired four-star U.S.  Air Force  general who was the NATO supreme allied commander from 2013-2016, asked, ""At what point does the west determine that we have to do something a little more concrete to aid the Ukrainian people?"" RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES ""What is it that we stand for? And what is it that we accept when it comes to Russia destroying a nation and terrorizing a people?""

      Retired U.S. General Philip Breedlove, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, in a November 2014 file photo. 
       (REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov) Breedlove said the fastest way to get his plan up and running for a humanitarian no fly-zone would be through ""a coalition of the willing,"" which he said would be a step down from a military no-fly zone and have different rules of engagement. Having recently voiced support for a military no-fly zone he also warned of the dire consequences that would come with it, noting that it would be tantamount to war. ""If you declare a military no-fly zone, you have to be ready to defend it.""  He explained how the humanitarian zone would work. ""The rules of engagement would be that we are constructing a humanitarian operation to allow for humanitarian relief corridors and all other manner of things on the ground below them. We are not going to fire on our opponent unless our opponent fires on us. And so, we tell the opponent that this is a humanitarian no-fly zone. We will not fire on your ground stations unless you fire on us, and we will not fire unless fired upon."" Breedlove, a Distinguished Chair for the Middle East Institute's Frontier Europe Initiative, told Fox News Digital that ""it would be something where we would transmit to our opponent what we are doing in order to stay out of a more bellicose posture. But it would be really up to the opponent how it would proceed if we went in there and tried to have a no-fly zone over the western half of Ukraine.""  Western Ukraine has so far not seen or felt the Russian offensive and it’s where many Ukrainians have fled to. He noted the extent of how it would help save civilians but said it still comes with many risks attached to it. ""We could get medical supplies and relief in, and humanitarian and medical tragedy out. If we set that up and then the opponent fired on us, then we would be in a situation where it would not be easy or perfect either, but it is definitely a step down from a military no-fly zone where we absolutely would go in and enforce it and take those strikes that would be required to make sure that no one else could fire on us in the no-fly zone.""     
      NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg took questions from reporters Friday, March 4, 2022.
       (NATO) FLORIDA STUDENT ON  HOW HE'S TRACKING RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS' PRIVATE JETS On Thursday, the U.N. refugee agency said that 1 million people had fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion last week, also warning that number could eventually rise to 4 million as the bloodshed worsens. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  again called for a no-fly over his country, Thursday, and as it continues to be rejected by NATO and the West, Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society in England, told Fox News Digital that there was a clear disconnect between the narrative that ""Putin must fail, and then failing to take the full extent of actions that might lead to this outcome."" Mendoza has another idea of how to implement a military no-fly zone which would be concentrated in the country’s west: ""It is clear that a no-fly zone and safe haven established in western Ukraine by NATO forces would mark a sensible escalation of NATO action in support of a free Ukraine, while eliminating the concern that we would be going immediately toe to toe with Russian forces located in the north, south and east. As such it is the obvious next step to wrest the initiative in this invasion back from Mr Putin, who currently enjoys the luxury of dictating the scale and pace of action.""  Mendoza argued ""The western Ukraine option has been wrongly subsumed in the more general no-fly zone debate. If the Biden Administration were wise, it would get ahead of the game on the former and start lobbying allies now as it is likely that a future atrocity by the Russians will lead to huge public pressure to act in a meaningful way, and this option makes strategic sense without the danger of escalation."" Just this week  Germany  announced that it was sending more military aid to Ukraine including surface-to-air-missiles and anti-tank weapons. Meanwhile  Great Britain , a stalwart member of NATO, announced it too was sending more lethal defensive weapons to Kyiv.

""Some of this may be late in the game, but any military assistance that can be given by NATO remains absolutely vital for Ukraine's defense.""  Gardiner said that going forward he expects that NATO will show, ""a far greater degree of urgency and more strategic planning going into sending the defensive weapons that Ukraine needs. Much of this should have been done months ago, even years ago.""

DOUGLAS MURRAY:  If people could point me to one thing Kamala Harris has solved, there might be reason for the Europeans to have hope … You know very well, nobody can point to one thing she solved. She was given the southern border crisis. Two million illegal migrants came across the southern border in the last year. So that's just one of the crises she's failed to solve. And look at anything else she's been given in her strange portfolio — not solved any of it. So who do you send to solve the most intractable problem of the moment and the potential for World War III, but Kamala Harris. … It's possible [President Biden] is expecting that Kamala will say so many banal things for such a long time that the conflict will be over by then. Remember, she went to Munich the other day, and she told the Europeans that they had to remember they were in Europe, and that there was a war, and therefore this meant there was a war in Europe. War's bad, and Kamala told them that, and she told them where they were, and that war was bad. So if we can expect more of that from her, then yes, it's possible that Joe Biden simply sent her to just keep this running 'til the end.  WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:   Video  ",2022-03

   SEOUL, South Korea —  North Korea on Saturday  fired a suspected ballistic missile into the sea, according to its neighbors’ militaries, apparently extending its streak of weapons tests this year amid a prolonged freeze in nuclear negotiations with the United States. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a single launch of a presumed ballistic missile from an area near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang toward the country’s eastern waters, but it didn’t immediately say how far the weapon flew. Japanese Defense Minister  Nobuo Kishi said the missile likely landed outside the country’s exclusive economic zone, and that there were no immediate reports of damages to vessels. He said early assessments suggest the missile flew about 300 kilometers (180 miles) eastward at a maximum altitude of 550 kilometers (340 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. CHINA'S XI JINPING STRESSES COOPERATION WITH NORTH KOREA'S KIM UNDER ‘NEW SITUATION’: STATE MEDIA The flight details were similar to  North Korea’s previous launch on Sunday  that was also conducted from the area of Sunan near Pyongyang. North Korean state media said that launch was designed to test a camera system it plans to install on a spy satellite that is under development.

       South Korea’s presidential office said national security adviser Suh Hoon will preside over an emergency National Security Council meeting to discuss the launch. There was no immediate comment about the launch by the U.S. government or military. ""The missile was fired just as the international community is responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while also in the middle of the Beijing Paralympics,"" said Kishi, who canceled an appearance at a military academy graduation to respond to the launch. ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" he told reporters. ""The missile was fired just as the international community is responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while also in the middle of the Beijing Paralympics. This is absolutely unacceptable.""   — Nobuo Kishi, Japanese defense minister  It was North Korea’s ninth round of weapons launches in 2022 as it continues to use a pause in diplomacy to expand its military capabilities while attempting to pressure the Biden administration for concessions. The launch came as South Koreans waited in long lines at polling stations Saturday morning to participate in early voting ahead of a presidential election next Wednesday. The voting follows months of bitter campaigning in which the two major candidates have clashed over whether South Korea should continue to pursue engagement with the belligerent North or take a harder line to check its nuclear threat. The North’s other tests this year included a purported hypersonic missile and its first launch since 2017 of an intermediate range missile potentially capable of reaching Guam, a major U.S. military hub in the Pacific. Analysts say North Korea could up the ante in coming months and possibly resume its testing of major weapons like intercontinental ballistic missiles as it tries to move the needle with Washington, which is now preoccupied with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and regional competition with China. During a ruling Workers Party conference called by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, Politburo members issued a veiled threat to resume the tests of nuclear devices and ICBMs, which Kim had unilaterally suspended in 2018 to make room for diplomacy with then-President Donald Trump.

       (Associated Press) But negotiations remain derailed after the collapse of Trump and Kim’s second meeting in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility, which would have amounted to a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Biden administration has offered open-ended talks with Pyongyang but shown no willingness to offer badly needed economic benefits unless the North takes real steps to cut down its nuclear weapons and missile program. The North’s claim that it is testing camera systems for spy satellites suggests it could possibly conduct a banned long-range rocket test disguised as a space launch to advance its weaponry and apply more pressure on Washington. Some analysts predict that North Korea will launch a rocket carrying a satellite ahead of a major political anniversary in April, the birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un.

Russians [have been] trying to essentially … from the very beginning … destroy our sovereignty, our independence, our will to become [an] independent nation. And they demand things which will never pass … These are things that basically destroy any chance for Ukraine to be its own state. So as far as conversation there, … I would point to these peace talks. We need to give them their bodies, and we have so many Russians [who] died already in Ukraine. The transfer of these bodies needs to be organized, and that's something to discuss [in] these negotiations. Also, we have hundreds of their P.O.W.s, and they have some of ours. We need to talk about that, too. … But as far as the actual ending to the warfare, unfortunately [the] Russians aren't giving it a chance.  … [T]hey have been shelling that biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. The fact of the matter is, this is the way of them to [try] to hold Europe hostage. To say, ""You do anything, and we will blow this up. We will show you what [it] actually is [like] to fight with the Russians."" Essentially, that's the reality of what's happening. They have been reportedly mining the nuclear station.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Retired U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding told "" The Ingraham Angle "" on Friday that although there are trained operatives who could coordinate a  no-fly zone , it could lead to a conflict between the United States or Europe and  Russia  involving nuclear weapons. ROBERT SPALDING:  For the aircraft involved, most of the risks would be where are you going to deploy, out of what airfields are going to use? In addition, you need tankers, so those are typically pretty large aircraft that are easy to shoot down. You also need AWACS to identify aircraft that are flying around. And then on the battlefield, it's likely that you have surface-to-air, mobile surface-to-air missile systems that are moving around. So establishing a no-fly zone, while it's pretty straightforward, would have some complications and risks to the air crews of the tankers of the AWACS and of course, to the fighters that are there to enforce it. So it's easy to do in terms of actually executing it, but it's complicated in terms of getting all the pieces in place and making it happen. WATCH THE FULL SEGMENT BELOW:   Video  ",2022-03

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said there is a ""reasonable basis"" to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine.  ""The next step is to proceed with the process of seeking and obtaining authorization from the pre-trial chamber of the court to open an investigation,"" Khan said. Dustin Lewis, research director at the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict, told Fox News Digital the ICC will now investigate the allegations.  ""With respect to the situation in Ukraine, the ICC prosecutor may investigate allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide,"" Lewis said.

       (Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) He said evidence of the war crimes can be submitted by any person, government or nongovernmental organization. Any person or entity, including a government or an NGO, may submit evidence to the ICC prosecutor. It is the responsibility of the prosecutor to ascertain the reliability and probative value of the evidence obtained by the office. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told reporters Monday that Russia used a vacuum bomb, a violation of international law. ""They used the vacuum bomb today,"" Markarova said. ""The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large."" The bomb is considered a thermobaric weapon that absorbs oxygen out of a given area, which then causes a blast which is capable of vaporizing humans. Russian forces continue bombarding Ukraine's two largest cities, Kharkiv and Kyiv. While Lewis says it's impossible to predict the amount of time that an ICC investigation could take, past investigations could indicate that it may be years before the investigation into the situation in Ukraine is complete.

But if previous ICC investigations are a guide, an investigation concerning the situation in Ukraine might take many years,"" Lewis explained. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are state party members of the ICC, the court operates on the basis that it can prosecute individuals who are found to be responsible for a crime under the court's jurisdiction, regardless if that person is a citizen to a state party of the court. ""The ICC may exercise jurisdiction only over individual humans; it has no jurisdiction over states such as Ukraine and Russia,"" Lewis said. ""The ICC operates on the basis that it may prosecute anyone who is responsible for committing a crime falling within the jurisdiction of the court, irrespective of whether the person is a national of a state party to the court. Under that approach, the ICC may institute proceedings against a Russian or a Ukrainian national for a crime falling within the court’s jurisdiction allegedly committed on the territory of Ukraine during the current armed conflict.""

""The ICC is not permitted to conduct trials in absentia; in other words, the accused — whether a national of Russia or any other country — must be in the court’s custody to be prosecuted at trial.

Alexey Kovalyav, an editor at an independent news outlet in Russia and a fellow at the World Press Institute, said he left the country in a Friday tweet. ""Never thought it'd come to this, but I did have to leave Russia, crossing the border on foot in the middle of the night, with my panic-packed bags on my back and my dog in tow,"" he wrote.

""We’re in conversations with lawmakers about how to secure the funding, but it’s urgently needed."" Some of the consequences could be felt later this month. ""This is an urgent request and this is what is at stake in our fight against COVID,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday. A  request  sent to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) seeks $22.5 billion in immediate COVID-19 response needs with an ask for $10 billion to provide support to  Ukraine  following  Russia's  invasion.  ""I urge the Congress to address these critical and urgent needs as part of a comprehensive government funding bill ahead of the March 11th funding deadline,"" OMB acting Director Shalanda Young said in the Wednesday letter, noting that ""additional needs may arise over time"" due to the ""rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine.""

The Health Resources and Services Administration will be forced to begin winding down claims for COVID-19 treatment for uninsured people this month in Congress doesn't provide more money.

   PROGRAMMING ALERT: WATCH SEN. JONI ERNST DISCUSS THIS TOPIC AND MORE ON "" FOX NEWS SUNDAY "" ON SUNDAY, MARCH 6. The shock and horror of Russian President  Vladimir Putin 's lawless and bloody invasion of Ukraine are giving way to the fog of war. Exact data on casualty counts, the progress of the Russian advance, and the durability of the Ukrainian resistance remain unclear. Still, if the Ukrainians continue to increase their rate of lethal weapons deployment as they have in the last 72 hours, resupply becomes extremely urgent.  The  Ukrainian military  is in dire need of more lethal aid today. If they don't get more weaponry, ammunition, communications equipment, and medical supplies, then the probability of Russian triumph in a matter of weeks will significantly increase. Before invading, when weighing and determining his ultimate  endgame , Putin wasn't worried about his army's capacity to eventually take Ukraine,  mano a mano .  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The Russian military is three times the size of Ukraine's, and they have an even greater weapons advantage over Ukrainian forces. Putin bet against the Biden administration's resolve to proactively shield the American economy from Russian influence, to reverse course on a doctrine of appeasement that drove our disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, and, ultimately, our president's will to support and defend an agreement-bound partner.

Video Fast forward three years: Ukraine was still fragile, working through the challenges of establishing and sustaining democratic government while sitting atop the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons abandoned in the final days of the Soviet Union.  So, the United States intervened. In exchange for protection by the greatest superpower in the history of the world, Ukraine dismantled and surrendered its entire nuclear armament. That agreement—known as the Budapest Agreement—made the world safer, and Ukraine became an economic and security partner to the United States.

   The largest nuclear power plant in  Europe  is now in Russian hands. Europe exhaled when the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that the fire at the plant on Thursday night caused by Russian shelling was extinguished, that its six reactors were intact, and that there was no release of radioactive material from the plant. But while the prospect of nuclear meltdown has receded for now, Russian President  Vladimir Putin ’s nuclear blackmail of Ukraine and the West continues.

But the plant is no ordinary target.    Video Attacking a nuclear plant is an international war crime. And it will be added to the growing list of such crimes perpetrated by Russia’s president for which he may one day be held accountable when his aggression against Ukraine ends.  RUSSIAN TROOPS NEAR ANOTHER UKRAINE NUCLEAR PLANT, IN YUZHNOUKRAINSK, UN ENVOY SAYS Had the fire spread and containment of the radioactive material failed, the spread of radioactivity throughout Europe could have made the 1986 accident at Chernobyl pale by comparison. ""This is terrorism,"" said Joseph Cirincione, the former head of the Ploughshares Fund, which focuses on nuclear nonproliferation and conflict resolution.   Video While the goal of Putin’s attack on the plant is unclear, Cirincione said that Russia may have seized the plant to cut off electricity to Ukrainians to force them to surrender, literally, ""to freeze Ukraine."" If that is so, the attack on Zaporizhzhia may not be the only such assault on a nuclear facility.  RUSSIA USING UKRAINIAN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT TO TRY TO 'HOLD EUROPE HOSTAGE': UKRAINIAN MP Clearly the IAEA is concerned about another attack, though the agency seems uncertain about how to stop one.

   FIRST ON FOX:  Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is pledging support for Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  in the country's fight against Russia, beginning with an immediate ban on Russian oil and gas. Zelenskyy  on Saturday spoke to U.S. senators and House members virtually as  Congress  weighs additional aid requests to help the country fight off a brutal  Russian invasion .  During a call with Fox News Digital immediately following the senate's zoom with the Ukrainian leader, the senator spoke of Zelenskyy's ""tremendous courage."" RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES ""I thought it was very informative call. Obviously, he is showing tremendous courage both personally and then on behalf of the Ukrainian people. I mean, the people of Ukraine are such incredible fighters, and I think you could just see this certainly brave stand that they're making,"" Hawley said.     
      Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seen in a Zoom call with U.S. senators on Saturday, March 5, 2022. 
       ( Sen. Marco Rubio) Zelenskyy requested more lethal aid from the United States, including fighter planes, and a no-fly zone, which NATO rejected yesterday, Hawley said. The most interesting thing Zelenskyy said, according to Hawley, was immediately enacting tougher sanctions, starting with a ban on Russian oil imports. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., asked him about a possible oil ban. Zelenskyy ""emphasized that getting tougher on the sanctions was very important,"" Hawley said. ""And he said repeatedly that an embargo on Russia and particularly their oil and natural gas, was absolutely critical."" ""I couldn't agree more on the need to sanction oil and natural gas on the need to stop the United States importing it,"" Hawley added. ""And I cannot believe that the Biden administration continues to keep our energy production turned off and allow the Russians to move forward."" The Missouri senator also told Fox News Digital that Zelenskyy expressed that he had wished sanctions by the U.S. on Russia had come earlier, which may have prevented a war from beginning in the first place. US SENATORS TO MEET VIRTUALLY WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY Hawley said the leader ""had hoped and wished that sanctions would have come earlier. And of course, he's exactly right if we had sanctioned Nord Stream 2 in particular…let's remember, Joe Biden came to office and lifted the sanctions on Nord Stream 2."" The senator pointed out that all Democrats voted against enacting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in December, which he said has been ""a very, very costly mistake on their part and is certainly something that they're going to have to answer for.""

       (AP Photo/John Raoux) Hawley demanded the Biden administration stop imports of Russian ""blood oil"" immediately. Hawley said he will ""continue to try and open up U.S. energy production and continue to try to get stops, American imports of Russian oil and natural gas. And I amazed at every passing day that this administration will not sanction their energy sector and will not open arms up. I just think it's indefensible, indefensible that we were importing hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day from Russia. This is blood oil and this is financing the war."" ""And yet Joe Biden won't do anything about it, and he will not turn on our energy production. And it is absolutely indefensible that is costing the people of Ukraine. It is costing them lives. At this point, it is costing the American people, our security and both in terms of our national security as well as economic security. And it is the president has got to reverse course on this. His position is totally indefensible."" The senator concluded by saying Zelenskyy was very ""resolute"" and is committed to carrying on the fight against Russia.

   Ukraine President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  asked  Congress  for more lethal aid, more planes, more sanctions and to shut down Russian oil exports during a virtual video call with lawmakers Saturday as Washington weighs more aid to help Ukraine fight off a brutal  Russian invasion .  Zelenskyy spoke on a Zoom video call with more than 280 senators and House members. He wore a military green T-shirt, spoke aside a Ukrainian flag and appealed to the U.S. lawmakers for more help. ""He spoke from the heart,"" Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said on Fox News Channel, adding that Zelenskyy also requested to close the skies with a no-fly zone.   RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES The meeting comes as NATO rejected a Zelenskyy request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to provide air cover for the Ukrainian people. Zelenskyy slammed the decision, but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that having alliance planes over Ukrainian airspace could spark a new world war. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the Article 5 provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked all member countries will take action to assist.

       ( Sen. Marco Rubio) A Senate source told Fox News Digital that in addition to the no-fly zone discussion, Zelenskyy asked for more planes and expressed concern that the United States was standing in the way of other NATO nations sending planes.  Zelenskyy said Poland is ready to send planes, specifically Russian-made MiGs which Ukrainians can fly, but the U.S. had not signed off because of fear it would be seen as an escalation, a source told Fox News.   Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also said the U.S. is standing in the way of ""other NATO nations sending MiG’s,"" in a video he posted after the Zelenskyy call. But a U.S. defense official denied the U.S. is blocking European nations from sending warplanes to Ukraine.  ""If Poland wants to send its warplanes to Ukraine, it can. The US is not blocking them from doing so,"" the official told Fox News. The lawmakers were moved by Zelenksyy's appeal and showed bipartisan support for Ukraine and approving more U.S. aid.   ""President Zelenskyy made a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer.""  On the video call, Zelenskyy called the Russians ""devils,"" according to Daines, and described the horrors of the war and how Russians are killing and shelling civilians. He said children were killed in kindergartens and at a special needs school, three nuclear plants have been attacked, and the Russians won't let fire departments extinguish fires, according to another Senate source. ""Don’t allow brave and strong people who share your values to be exterminated,"" Zelenskyy told lawmakers, according to the Senate source. Zelenskyy said he needs more lethal aid to push back on Russian President Vladimir Putin, another Senate source said. He also demanded the U.S. cut off Visa and Mastercard in Russia and that the U.S. must embargo Russian oil. ""President Zelenskyy made it clear that Putin's forces are barbarous, and that Ukraine needs immediate resources to help control airspace for defense and humanitarian purposes,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told Fox News Digital. ""He also expressed that it is imperative that the West help."" The Ukrainian president also told senators, ""If you had started sanctions months ago, there would not have been war,"" according to a third source within the Senate. US SENATORS TO MEET VIRTUALLY WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reacted to that comment on Fox News Channel and explained that sanctions work best when they are in coordination with allies, but the problem was U.S. allies did not believe Putin was going to invade, like the U.S. was insisting.  Kaine said he had never seen ""a wider gulf between the US and our allies"" prior to the invasion when it came to Putin's intentions.    Video ""Yes, earlier sanctions might have worked better,"" Kaine told Fox News Channel. ""But we weren't on the same page until the invasion happened.""  Zelenskyy said during the call that Ukraine has a strong relationship with Poland and the humanitarian assistance and military assistance flows easily. Zelenskyy told the lawmakers that Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko doesn't control the Belarus troops, Russia is ordering their military. Earlier Saturday, Zelenskyy urged Russia and Belarus to cooperate on providing humanitarian corridors, so civilians can escape the war zone.

Prince Michael  allegedly told the reporters  by Zoom that he would give their company his royal endorsement in a recorded speech for a $200,000-fee.

Outlet RIA claimed that a nationalist battalion ""blew up a house in Mariupol"" and claimed that Russia continued to observe the temporary ceasefire, citing the Russian Defense Ministry. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said in a statement that it believed the Russian ceasefire was ""likely an attempt to deflect international condemnation while resetting its forces for renewed offensive activity."" ""By accusing Ukraine of breaking the agreement, Russia is likely seeking to shift responsibility for current and future civilian casualties in the city,"" it said.  The accusations show how fragile the ceasefire is amid a constantly accelerating humanitarian crisis in Ukraine as the war enters its 10th day.

The FIA ruled Friday all drivers must agree to its principles of peace and neutrality and ""acknowledge the strong commitment made by the FIA to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine."" Mazepin  posted on Twitter  he had agreed to the stipulations and was disappointed in Haas' decision. ""While I understand the difficulties, the ruling from FIA plus my ongoing willingness to accept the conditions proposed in order to continue were completely ignored and no process was followed in this unilateral step,"" Mazepin wrote.

   Russian  President  Vladimir Putin 's invasion of  Ukraine  is just one example of how he will undermine other nations to achieve his ultimate goal, and, unless America and other European nations begin taking action, it won't be the last time he will take military action in the face of resistance, according to a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer. While there is difficulty across the globe to push back against Putin's current war with Ukraine,  Rebekah Koffler , a former DIA officer and author of "" Putin’s Playbook : Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" spoke with Fox News Digital about the need for America and other European nations to act quickly to implement a ""deterrent strategy"" to Russia's aggression.     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed into law legislation that could punish journalists with up to 15 years in prison for reporting so-called ""fake"" news about his military invasion of Ukraine.       
       (Yuri Kochetkov/Pool) UKRAINE HUMANITARIAN CEASEFIRE WITH RUSSIA NOT HOLDING: LIVE UPDATES Describing the strategy, Koffler said it would be similar to the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) strategy which was used heavily during former President Reagan's administration amid the Cold War to prevent a nuclear war. The MAD doctrine was developed when the U.S., USSR, and other allies kept large quantities of nuclear weapons so that they were capable of destroying different regions if they were attacked. Putin is steps ahead of America on a number of issues as a ""direct result of [Russians] doing their homework,"" Koffler said, adding that Americans can push back against a lot of ongoing problems from Russia if we ""start doing our homework again and actually putting both intellectual and financial resources into a counter strategy to Putin's playbook."" Speaking about research which suggests a war between Russia and the United States is inevitable, Koffler said it is time for other NATO countries to step up and pitch in with defense efforts as she reflected on statements made by Putin in 2015. ""Fifty years ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one thing: If a fight's inevitable, you must strike first,"" Putin said at the time, referencing a place from his childhood.

Discussing Putin's ultimate goal, Koffler said Putin aims to have ""neutral pro-Soviet states, ideally pro-Russia governments"" that he can control. Briefly describing the actions she believes America should take to resist Putin's tactics, Koffler placed great emphasis on energy independence, securing networks from cyberattacks, and safety for American satellites, which she said are ""extremely vulnerable."" ""It's not an easy thing to do,"" she said of the cost to secure networks, noting that ""security was an afterthought"" when the internet was created. ""Our satellites are extremely vulnerable because of the same thing that can be done to our networks – cyber attacks.""

   To Olena, it feels like  Vladimir Putin  has been chasing her for years. Fed up with Putin’s government, the  Russian  citizen left her native country six years ago and moved to Ukraine, where she helped raise funds for women and children whose homes had been destroyed in years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region. Then, this week, she was on the move again — fleeing her adopted home of Kyiv ahead of Putin’s invaders.

So I chose to vote with my legs and leave."" She moved to Ukraine, she said, because she was inspired by the Maidan revolution of 2014, when sustained protests forced the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych. ""As long as Putin is in power, I will never go back,"" she said.

   After fleeing her home in now- Taliban  controlled Afghanistan, Mozhgan Entazari did everything she could to find a new one for her family in the sunny, palm tree-lined communities of Southern California. The 34-year-old mother of two scoured options on Zillow with her husband, while the family lived at a hotel in Irvine, south of  Los Angeles . She spent $200 for an Uber ride to see an apartment 90 minutes away only to find it had been rented. Entazari needed a place not just for her immediate family but for seven members of her extended family.     
      Afghan refugee Mozhgan Entazari, right, talks about the challenge to find proper housing for her family in Southern California, during an interview at a hotel lobby in Irvine, Calif., Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2022.
       (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) In the end, it took four months. On Sunday, they will move into a five-bedroom house in Corona, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of LA, which is renting for $4,000. The family’s struggles are emblematic of what tens of thousands of Afghans are finding since they moved off U.S. military bases and into American cities and towns following last summer’s dramatic airlift operation. Many hope to settle in Southern  California  and the  Washington, D.C ., area, where Afghans previously established vibrant communities with Halal grocery stores and mosques. But these communities also are among the country’s priciest housing markets, and units, especially those suitable for often larger Afghan families, are in short supply. Resettlement agencies report it’s taking longer to get refugees out of temporary housing like hotels, Airbnbs and churches. 1,3 Entazari will share a roof with her husband and kids, along with her mother, teen sister and her brother and his family. Without a job, credit history or co-signer, she said it was incredibly difficult to find housing. And without an address, she said she and her husband couldn’t get jobs and her kids couldn’t enroll in school. ""All our life depends on housing,"" Entazari said in Farsi through a volunteer interpreter. They had to pay two months of rent to move in, and are getting help from an organization that will fund a portion of the monthly rent until next year.

       (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) The search for housing for Afghans comes amid a tightening housing market as the U.S. crawls out of the  pandemic . The nationwide vacancy rate for rental units dropped about one percentage point, to 5.6%, in the last quarter of 2020, according to recently released U.S. Census data. The typical U.S. rent was up nearly 16% to more than $1,850 in January compared to last January, according to the online real estate marketplace Zillow, which launched an effort in November to help connect landlords with newly arrived Afghans. In northern Virginia, Ahmad Saeed Totakhail was lucky to find permanent housing in Dale City, a suburb about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Washington. His sister, who housed him until he got a place of his own, lives there. He was hired to work in nearby Arlington, by the same nonprofit that employed him in Kabul. The area’s stunning mosques and plentiful Afghan eateries have softened the blow of leaving his homeland. But he was shocked by the high price for his family’s safe haven — $2,000 a month for rent. ""It’s quite expensive,"" he said. ""I have friends here. I have my relatives here. But we never discussed the economics."" RUSSIA IN FOR NASTY GUERRILLA WARFARE CAMPAIGN THAT WILL BLEED THEM DRY, FORMER GREEN BERET SAYS About half of all Afghan immigrants to the United States, many who came decades ago, live in five major metropolitan areas — Washington, Sacramento, California, San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, according to the Migration Policy Institute. As a result, these areas are often attractive for Afghan newcomers, and many list the names of relatives or acquaintances already living there as contacts when resettlement agencies are considering where to send them.

      Totakhail is one of numerous Afghan refugees who has settled in northern Virginia and says the readymade network of support in the local Afghan community makes it a great place to be despite the high cost of housing. 
       (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) But with some 76,000 Afghans arriving in the United States since the Taliban takeover of their country last year, many of these cities are reaching their saturation point, said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service. The resettlement agency has teamed with Airbnb to provide temporary housing while talking to property management companies to find a more permanent solution. They’ve opened offices in more affordable markets to meet the housing demand. But the places also must have a robust job market and institutions and businesses that support Afghan families, such as mosques and Halal markets, she said. The U.S. State Department says it doesn’t track how many of the  Afghans  are in temporary accommodations. The top states for Afghans arriving following the Taliban takeover are Texas (nearly 10,500); California (over 8,200), Virginia (over 5,100) and Washington (over 2,800), according to State Department data. Near the nation’s capital, Lutheran Social Services has helped settle more than 4,000 Afghans since last summer. For many, the benefits of a community that is like ""a second Kabul"" outweigh the high housing costs, said Zabi, a housing coordinator for LSS and relatively recent refugee from Afghanistan who asked to be identified by his nickname because he still has family who could be targeted there because of his prior work with the U.S. military. Zabi is working to convince area landlords and property owners that Afghan refugees are worth granting some leeway. ""They’re gonna pay their rent, that’s for sure,"" he said, adding many find employment quickly, with help from the agency and the existing Afghan community. HOW HUNDREDS OF AFGHANS WERE SAVED FROM THE TALIBAN BY VETERANS IN A DIGITAL DUNKIRK: THE LAST 96 In Newburyport, Massachusetts, churches opened their doors to temporarily  house  four Afghan families. The Rev. Jarred Mercer said helping them set down permanent roots is daunting given the high cost of living in the largely white, affluent community near the New Hampshire state line. He and another pastor are working with city officials and hope to bring local property owners and nonprofits on board to help tackle the housing question. In the meantime, they’ve raised funds and formed volunteer committees to coordinate everything from teaching English classes to driving the families around town. ""They’re getting more and more entrenched in town, especially the children, and it would just be more trauma to uproot them and start the whole process over again,"" Mercer said.

Sadozai, who came to the country as a refugee four decades ago from Afghanistan, said she’s been doing this work for years and never faced so many hurdles. She said she was able to help Entazari and her family move out of the Irvine hotel partly because of luck: An Afghan man she had helped find housing four years ago reached out to her about a Syrian friend who had a house for rent.

TPS protects nationals of designated countries living in the U.S. from deportation if they are eligible and allows them to apply for work permits and to travel freely.

We're approaching the two-week mark of fighting, but despite all the press conferences, the tweets, the official statements, the debates, votes, and opinions, there are still a lot of very serious, open questions about how Vladimir Putin can keep his war machine supplied and funded. The fight can't go on indefinitely, so what's Putin's plan here? Question 1 here: First, the level of engagement by the Russian Air Force has been surprisingly minimal. … Military analysts are puzzled by Putin's failure to use all of his air assets to create his desired dystopian hellscape on the ground in Ukraine. Why is that?  … Second, is Putin being strategic here and calculating with his ground forces? Also, if he's holding his ground forces back in this convoy, why? Is he bogged down? Did they not prepare? Does he really — another question here — want to destroy major cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv? Does he want to obliterate ports while planning to occupy them later? Kind of an asinine goal, right? Can he afford to rebuild them later? The answers to these questions are still unknown, but they have to be asked, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

       What is the status of a potential humanitarian corridor? Humanitarian  corridor is the only achievement from our negotiations. We have so many people stuck in the cities, children, women, and foreign students from China, India, Pakistan from Turkey. We agreed with the Russian side that we will do a humanitarian corridor under Red Cross supervision.  The main fear for the military people is that when we have a ceasefire on the sector, sides might use this to regroup military forces and get some competitive advantage. When we release a ceasefire both sides have to stop moving military troops.   Which towns are we talking about?   In the East. It's Mariupol, one of the hottest spots, where we have 200,000 people and a small village of Volnovakha, we have about 25,000 people. We prepared buses and trains, and we also have lists of foreign students. We don't yet have an exact list for local citizens, but we have a local administration supporting this. If both sides confirm the ceasefire early in the morning, we will start the evacuation process.  Next round of talks with Russia is scheduled for Monday. Any progress so far? I would not say we are moving fast because we have a lot of people killed every day, especially civilians. It's tough, honestly, but we are still demonstrating some progress. At least, two groups are listening to each other and actively discussing different things.    The only parts which are almost impossible to agree on are Crimea and so-called republics that Russia insists that we recognize as independent. This is not acceptable within Ukrainian society. And it's not about the politicians, it's about Ukrainian people who will never let this happen. This is the main challenge and, honestly, we still don't know how we could overcome those barriers.    What are the major issues that you are not willing to compromise during these negotiations?   The territorial integrity of Ukraine.   I don't think that we have a choice now to even discuss some models where we would recognize those territories. Our position is firm. We are ready to discuss any other dynamic options, but not recognition of those territories.   How about NATO membership? Is it something you are ready to negotiate about?    The response that we are getting from the  NATO  countries is that they are not ready to even discuss having us in NATO, not for the closest period of five or 10 years. We would not fight for the NATO applications, we would fight for the result, but not for the process.   We are ready to discuss some non-NATO models. For example, there could be direct guarantees by different countries like the U.S., China, U.K., maybe Germany and France. We are open to discuss such things in a broader circle, not only in bilateral discussions with Russia, but also with other partners.  RUSSIA INVASION: REFUGEES FLEEING UKRAINE MARK LARGEST, FASTEST DISPLACEMENT PATTERN SINCE WWII NATO voiced its decision yesterday, saying they will not implement a no-fly zone over the Ukrainian sky. What is an alternative to it?    We started to get some military advantages and Russia started to use aviation heavily. In the first days, they destroyed all of our air defense facilities. They are basically flying in empty sky, they dominate the sky. Once we stop their domination in the sky, we will fight back on the land. Even considering the fact that their army is five or ten times bigger than ours, we are pretty sure that we will fight back and put them away back to the place where they started from. That's why the no-fly zone is so important, it saves so many lives.  We know that the recent surveys show 70 percent of  U.S.  citizens, American people, are supporting that we should stop Russian planes. It could be done in different ways -  not only by providing the guarantees that NATO is afraid of, but also by providing Ukraine with air defense weapons, so that we can defend ourselves. We don't need NATO planes, give us air defense rockets and we will do the job ourselves.   We are hearing that former U.S. President  Donald Trump  is planning to visit Kyiv together with a couple republican congressmen to show their support to Ukraine. This is a good sign. Politicians are beginning to listen to what American citizens support and they support providing additional weapons to brave Ukrainian soldiers. I think eventually. Politicians will make that decision.  David, you are from Abkhazia yourself, [a Georgian region under Russian occupation]. Tell me how it felt to sit across the table from negotiators of the Russian government, while your both homelands are under Russian occupation? It's crazy, when I was 12 years old I had to leave my country and run away just because the Russian soldiers invaded my country. I moved here, I grew up, I built my own business, I started up my family and got kids in Ukraine. I was strong in Ukraine. And then the same happens here, same people. For me, it's very personal. At 12, I could not fight back and now - at 42 I will fight back for sure and I'll do my best to stop them.   You showed up at the negotiation meeting in all-black street style outfit with a baseball cap on, that photo went viral on social media. Was there a message you were trying to relay? I decided that we need some creative solutions. All you see is old school diplomats wearing black ties and talking from the paper, they just read instructions from Moscow. In peaceful conditions, I never wear these caps. But because we have to shake hands and we have to follow certain protocols, I decided to use my baseball cap to show my real attitudes to this country. And I will not stop using it until we find peace in Ukraine’s interests.  There is no dynamics, no flexibility on their side. Every time I offer some deviations of processes, they say they need to contact Moscow. On our side, we have more freedom, more choices, because we need the result, we don't need to demonstrate the process. If it's just to demonstrate the process, we would prefer to skip it and honestly tell our people that this process is not workable. I said from the very beginning that the negotiation process shall be on the win-win conditions, not listening to their ultimatums under the gun. If you want to continue this strategy, we will just stand up, go home and we will fight back.   RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: PHOTOS SHOW HARSH REALITIES OF UKRAINIANS UNDER SIEGE You sound very energized and optimistic. Is this the overall morale in Ukraine now? The morale is crazy right now, president  Zelenskyy  has 95 percent support. This is an unprecedented support and he has it because he is not leaving the country, he is not leaving Kyiv.    A couple of days ago, we had a real talk and decided to stay in Ukraine until the last minute. And if we have to die, we will become symbols and all other Ukrainians will fight back until the last drop of their blood. This is a strong, strong sign to Russia.   Russian soldiers have low levels of morale because they send young people who don't know why and for what they are fighting here.  Though they have these planes and equipment, our people are still fighting and we have millions of people who are ready to fight. We just need more weapons to give them and I'm pretty sure that we will win.  If there is anything you’d like American citizens to hear from you?  I would like to thank every American who supports Ukraine right now. I know there are millions, tens of millions of them. Some even come here willing to sign up in battalions and ready to fight the Russian army because they see that Russia invaded us with no reason.

191,Former US secretary of defense details if Putin has territorial ambitions past Ukraine,Fox News Staff,2022-03-05 22:21:00,"  close     Video   Robert Gates: Putin will need to do this to secure Ukraine   Former U.S. secretary of defense lays out what needs to be done and the risks Putin has to take to secure Ukraine. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told "" One Nation with Brian Kilmeade "" on Saturday what Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to achieve to secure  Ukraine  and install a puppet government. ROBERT GATES:  He has nowhere near enough troops to put down a rebellion among millions of people in Ukraine, so he's going to have to keep a significant military force in Ukraine. He's probably going to have to increase it if he wants to hold on to that country, even if he imposes a puppet government, he's going to have to keep forces there to keep that government in power. So I think between having his hands full in Ukraine and the risk of a true war with NATO, I think he'll be very cautious about doing anything that crosses borders of NATO countries. Now I do think in the Baltic States, there is the chance that he will use intelligence means — cyber, covert operations and so on — to try and create unrest in those countries. Thirty percent of the population in Estonia and Latvia, both are Russians. And so I can see him trying to create problems in the Baltic countries, but I don't see him invading, and I would just make one final point. I think that what's really important here are the troops that the United States has sent, and it's not just the 101st Airborne and the 82nd Airborne, it's sending heavy armored brigades. This is serious stuff, and that's what's needed to send a signal to the Russians that crossing into a NATO country, we mean business. And I think sending even more of those armored brigades would be a good idea. WATCH THE FULL SEGMENT BELOW:   Video  ",2022-03

KEITH KELLOGG:  It's pretty simple. We are heading into act II of a multi-act play. It's probably a Greek tragedy when you look at it.

He's probably going to have to go back to the old Soviet-style use of artillery, which will be massive, and start to take down that city. And he's going to use every weapon he has … which will include cluster-bombs to take down that city. It's a city of about 3 million.  … Putin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back then. We didn't. We waited. And part of the reason we said, is because we believed if we did, it was going to be escalatory. Well, now we're too late. But if we had been reacting, let's say, six weeks ago … we could have trained up pilots [who] are current pilots in the Ukrainian Air Force on things like the A-10 and then transfer those weapons systems to … Ukraine.

   TEL AVIV — Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held talks with  President  Vladimir Putin  Saturday in the Kremlin over  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , and then spoke with  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky , an attempt to mediate a conflict that has caused growing civilian casualties and refugees. Before Mr. Bennett’s visit, diplomacy by President Biden and European leaders failed to stop Mr. Putin from invading Ukraine or rolling back his tanks. In the face of massive Western sanctions,  Mr. Putin has found himself increasingly cut off from the world , with few avenues for diplomacy and with his country’s economy unplugged from much of global commerce. Mr. Bennett’s meeting with Mr. Putin took place ""with the blessing of the U.S. administration,"" said Mr. Bennett’s office, which also noted that it coordinated with Germany and France. After seeing Mr. Putin, Mr. Bennett left Moscow for Berlin, where he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the prime minister’s office said. Mr. Bennett was joined by Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who was born in the now Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and assisted with the translation. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES The nearly three-hour conversation with Mr. Putin touched on the safety of Ukraine’s Jewish population and  international talks over Iran’s nuclear program , Mr. Bennett’s office said. On Saturday, new demands from Russia—a party to the nuclear talks—threatened to derail efforts to restore the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a pact that Israel opposes. Sabbath flight to Moscow Mr. Bennett flew to Moscow as Russian troops continued to meet fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces, and an agreement to evacuate civilians from two besieged cities fell apart. Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor last week has caused civilian casualties and sparked the largest movement of people in Europe since World War II as Ukrainians flee the bloodshed.

       The meeting comes about a week after Mr. Bennett, in a call with Mr. Putin, offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Putin said during that call that he was ""ready for negotiation,"" a senior Israeli official said. Throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel has found itself caught between powerful opposing forces. Israel’s most important ally, the U.S., and pro-Western Ukraine, with a large Jewish population, have pushed Israel to side strongly with the Ukrainians. At the same time, Mr. Bennett’s government has worried that taking sides would jeopardize its relationship with Russia, which allows Israel the freedom to bomb Iranian positions in Syria.     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in Sochi, Russia, Oct. 22, 2021. 
       (Sputnik/Evgeny Biyatov/Kremlin via Reuters) Mr. Bennett has faced pressure domestically to boost support to Ukraine. Israel has so far refused a Ukrainian request for weapons and other military equipment, such as helmets and protective vests, Ukraine’s ambassador, Yevgen Korniychuk, said earlier this week. But Israel has condemned Russia’s invasion and voted for a  United Nations resolution demanding an end to the offensive . Mr. Bennett, an observant Jew, flew to Moscow during the Sabbath, underlining the urgent nature of his mission. Israel has worked to maintain good relations with the Kremlin and has been keen not to anger Moscow during the conflict. Russia’s launch of a military intervention in Syria in 2015 turned it into an important player in the Middle East. Israel sees Russia’s presence there as a moderating influence among Islamist militant organizations such as Hezbollah and Iran’s increasingly aggressive stance. Mr. Putin’s stated aim of his invasion and decapitation of the Ukrainian government is denazification of the country, despite Mr. Zelensky’s Jewish origins. Since Russia struck a television tower earlier this week in Kyiv’s Babyn Yar area, the site of one of the worst massacres during the Holocaust, international Jewish condemnation of Russia’s invasion has grown. Negotiations since December Mr. Bennett’s efforts follow a series of negotiations and letters exchanged between Washington, Moscow and European capitals since mid-December, when Russia demanded written guarantees that NATO wouldn’t expand eastward and  that NATO withdraw troops and missiles from countries that joined the alliance after 1997. As Russia built up close to 200,000 troops on the Ukraine border, Germany’s Mr. Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron were among the leading Europeans to visit Moscow in recent weeks, seeking to persuade Mr. Putin that his security concerns about Ukraine and NATO’s expansion could be dealt with through dialogue. Mr. Scholz sought to float some form of initiative based around the idea that Ukraine was unlikely to become a NATO member for many years. Mr. Macron suggested some form of neutrality for Ukraine had come up in talks. Ultimately, the Kremlin didn’t budge on its initial demands and Mr. Putin went ahead with his invasion even while discussions were continuing with the Europeans and days before Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to meet his French and U.S. counterparts in Europe. ""Yes, there was duplicity. Yes, there was a deliberate choice to launch the war when we were still negotiating peace,"" Mr. Macron said in late February after a meeting of EU leaders on the Ukraine crisis.

       (Associated Press) Both Messrs. Macron and Scholz have spoken to Mr. Putin in recent days, urging him to stop the violence. For Mr. Bennett the stakes are also high. In addition to Israel’s close relationship with Russia and Ukraine and its efforts not to anger Washington by sitting on the fence over the crisis, Mr. Bennett’s visit comes at a critical moment in the Vienna talks on restoring the nuclear deal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Israel has long opposed the 2015 pact and is pressing its partners to ensure that if the deal is restored, pressure is kept on Iran to fully cooperate with international inspectors in Iran and to ensure Iran doesn’t cheat. Russia has played a leading role in negotiating the restoration of the deal between the U.S. and Iran. However on Saturday, Mr. Lavrov threw a new hurdle in the way of a deal, demanding guarantees from Washington that powerful Western sanctions against Russia over its Ukraine attack won’t disrupt trade between Russia and Iran under a restored agreement.

""But within the framework of international cooperation, I think we can keep delivering weapons to Ukraine."" The Russian invasion has prompted 1.4 million refugees to flee the violence,  according to reports . Many of those traveled across Ukraine’s border with Poland.

(AP) The Russian Federation budgets for  roughly $60 billion to $70 billion  per year to fund its military, which helps finance salaries and training costs, maintain gear and facilities and develop or buy new weapons, gear and vehicles. If the military is not translating that into its war effort, it raises questions about whether Russia’s corruption has undermined its combat ability. Rebekah Koffler , a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, said that Russia has a habit of holding onto outdated equipment, but corruption is ""absolutely"" affecting everything, including the military, with both private businessmen and the mafia taking cuts.  AMERICAN BASKETBALL STAR BRITTNEY GRINER DETAINED IN RUSSIA ON DRUG CHARGES, FACES UP TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON ""Corruption is so rampant,"" Koffler told Fox News Digital. ""There’s not the same scrupulousness in Russia – it’s former Soviet Union, and it’s not even in the culture to check the expiration because no one would trust it anyways."" The setup in Russia  between the oligarchs  – billionaires who control whole sections of Russian industry – and  the mafia  is fairly unique compared to the West. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr told Fox News Digital that while there is no specific organized crime ring in the military, it’s ""certain"" organized crime operates in the Russian military to some degree.  ""We talk about how the U.S. military is a reflection of U.S. society, and we had this issue with gangs in the military not terribly long ago,"" Spoehr explained. ""By that same notion, it would be astonishing if there wasn’t organized crime in the Russian military because Russian society is rife with organized crime. It’s almost like another economy the way Russia operates.""  He said the Russian military prioritizes its navy over its army, which may contribute to the poor rations and guns seen on social media. But he added that while the Russian military ostensibly acquires new weapons and equipment through its bureau of acquisitions, there is no doubt ""a certain amount of corruption.""  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: PHOTOS SHOW HARSH REALITIES OF UKRAINIANS UNDER SIEGE ""There is graft, malfeasance, all those kinds of things,"" Spoehr said. ""So people are skimming off the top, maybe in some cases accepting shoddy goods, sometimes enriching themselves by directing contracts to their favorite oligarch – all that stuff happens.""  But Spoehr stressed that strategic issues and logistical shortcomings are likely more responsible for Russia’s shocking performance in Ukraine than any possible corruption.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dan Hoffman , a Fox News contributor and former CIA station chief in Moscow, argues that we can’t know to what degree corruption has impacted the Russian military – only that the troops are ""challenged"" and cannot say what the cause is.  He argued it is just as likely that the planned revitalization of supplies and forces following the Georgia invasion in 2008 never took hold as it should have, or it could be that the military hadn’t tried to stage a full invasion since World War II and wasn’t prepared for the realities of such an operation.   ",2022-03

   If you need further proof of the widening chasm between former Vice President  Mike Pence  and his one-time boss, former President  Donald Trump , look to Pence’s speech this weekend at the  Republican  National Committee’s (RNC) retreat for top GOP donors.  ""There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom,"" Pence said at the RNC’s gathering in New Orleans, according to excerpts of his speech obtained by Fox News and to tweets by the former vice president.

PENCE, IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, CALLS ON BIDEN TO HIT RUSSIA HARDER Pence didn’t refer to Trump by name, but his targeting of those in the GOP who haven’t condemned Russian President  Vladimir Putin ’s deadly invasion of neighboring  Ukraine  follows recent remarks by the former president describing Putin’s ""genius"" and ""savvy"" in launching the attack. At a speech a week ago at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, Trump reemphasized his stance toward the Russian leader, telling the crowd that Putin was ""smart."" Trump was scheduled to speak at the RNC donor retreat on Saturday night. Pence also swiped at Trump during his speech over the former president’s constant re-litigating of his 2020 election loss to now  President Biden  and his repeated claims, without providing concrete proof, that his defeat was due to massive voter fraud. ""Elections are about the future,"" Pence said, emphasizing comments he made in a December interview with Fox News. ""My fellow Republicans, we can only win if we are united around an optimistic vision for the future based on our highest values. We cannot win by fighting yesterday’s battles, or by re-litigating the past."" 2024 WATCH: DIVIDE BETWEEN PENCE AND TRUMP WIDENS Trump and his former vice president could potentially face off if both decide to bid for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Trump has repeatedly flirted with making another White House run, and Pence is making the early moves that could eventually lead to a bid of his own.

       ( (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)) Pence, who has been crisscrossing the country to help fellow Republicans running in the November elections,  told Fox News  during a stop in New Hampshire in early December that after the midterms are over, ""we’ll do as our family has always done. We’ll reflect and pray and consider where we might next serve."" For four years, Pence served as the loyal vice president to Trump. But everything changed on Jan. 6, 2021, as right-wing extremists – including some chanting ""hang Mike Pence"" -  stormed the U.S. Capitol  aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory that was overseen by Pence.

And last month, in his strongest language to date, Pence rebuked his one-time boss, calling him out by name while discussing Trump's claim that Pence could have overturned the results of the 2020 presidential election.

       (Stephen M. Dowell/Lake Buena Vista Sentinel via AP) ""There are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of Congress, I possessed unilateral authority to reject electoral college votes,"" Pence said near the end of a speech at a Federalist Society conference in Florida in which he mostly took aim at the Biden administration.  PENCE BOOKS BACK-TO-BACK TRIPS TO SOUTH CAROLINA ""I heard this week, President Trump said I had the right to ‘overturn the election’. President Trump is wrong … I had no right to overturn the election,"" Pence said to applause from the crowd of conservative lawyers. Christie, Hutchinson, to New Hampshire Former New Jersey Gov.

       (Fox News ) Fox News reported on Thursday that the former two-term governor and 2016 GOP presidential candidate will speak on March 21 at ‘Politics and Eggs’ at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College. The speaking series over the past two decades has become a must stop for White House hopefuls visiting the Granite State. Six years ago, Christie’s presidential run crashed and burned after a disappointing and distant sixth-place finish in New Hampshire’s presidential primary, where he’d placed all his chips. CHRIS CHRISTIE PUSHES POST-TRUMP VISION OF THE GOP Unlike nearly all the other potential 2024 Republican presidential contenders, Christie has no problem speaking publicly about his likely national ambitions, telling Fox News in November that ""having run already, I’m not going to run for the experience. I’ve had the experience. If I run, I run because I think I can win, and I think I can make a difference."" Fox News also reported that term-limited Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas will speak at ‘Politics and Eggs’ on April 25.

Amy Klobuchar  of Minnesota this weekend became the latest alum of the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination race to return to New Hampshire. Kloubuchar on Saturday was in the coastal city of Portsmouth to headline a major New Hampshire Democratic Party dinner and fundraiser. New Hampshire’s a key general election battleground and while Klobuchar’s mission was all about the 2022 elections, her trip did spark a touch of 2024 buzz as speculation persists that 79-year-old Biden may not seek reelection for a second term even though he's repeatedly said he'll run again. Klobuchar’s no stranger to the Granite State. She had a solid third place finish in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary – just a few points behind  Sen. Bernie Sander s of Vermont and now Transportation Secretary  Pete Buttigieg .

   ""It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera."" Those words from the  Metropolitan Opera  manager Peter Gelb makes it sound like soprano Anna Netrebko has died or lost her voice in some accident.  In reality, Netrebko was canceled for failing to  denounce Vladimir Putin . As with the criminalization of support for Putin in some countries, the termination of Netrebko is an attack on free speech.  It is perfectly bizarre for the Met to stand against tyranny by  attacking free speech , the very right that combats tyranny in all forms. This is not just the day that the music died for Netrebko, it is the day that free speech died at the Met. DEFENDING RELIGION IN UKRAINE – RUSSIA'S PUTIN DISTORTS SHARED CHRISTIAN ROOTS TO JUSTIFY WAR Despite my strong support for Ukraine and condemnation of Putin, it is important for advocates of civil liberties and free speech to be vigilant in calling out such abusive measures. It is during wartime and periods of social discord that the greatest abuses can occur for those with dissenting or unpopular views.     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulates Anna Netrebko after awarding her with the People's Artist of Russia honor in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Feb. 27, 2008.
       (AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky, File) Before addressing this latest controversy, it is also important to respond to what has become a rationalization on the left for attacks on free speech in recent years: the First Amendment only protects speech from government crackdowns.  The First Amendment is not the full or exclusive embodiment of free speech. It addresses just one of the dangers to free speech posed by government regulation. Many of us view free speech as a human right. Corporate censorship of social media clearly impacts free speech, and replacing Big Brother with a cadre of Little Brothers actually allows for far greater control of free expression.     
      Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy testifies in Washington, March 8, 1950, before a Senate subcommittee investigating his charges about communist infiltration of the State Department.
       (AP Photo/Herbert K. White) As I have noted earlier, while liberal writers and artists were blacklisted and investigated in the 1950s, liberal activists have succeeded in censoring opposing views to a degree that would have made Sen. Joe McCarthy, R-Wis., blush. Rather than burn books, they have simply gotten stores to ban them or blacklist the authors and artists. For these companies, there is no value to protecting the speech rights of dissenting voices with powerful politicians, academics and even some in the media demanding more censorship. No way forward? How about a free speech path where you allow an artist to perform for her art alone   Now back to the Met. According to media reports, Met officials ""made several attempts to convince Netrebko, who has made statements critical of the war, to rebuke Putin but failed to persuade the singer."" That sounds a lot like coerced speech: say these words or you can no longer sing at the Met. That sounds a lot like something Putin is doing in Russia as we speak. Saying, ""Well, we are not Putin"" is not enough when you are acting in the same way by punishing political viewpoints. Netrebko has had 192 performances at the Metropolitan Opera, and is one of the world's most celebrated singers. Did she lose the ability to hit such high notes due to the low note she strikes on politics?

       (Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images) Other Russians have faced backlash over their past praise of Putin or failure to condemn him now. One such example is Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin.  Frankly, I have never been a fan of Ovechkin not only because I am a Blackhawks fan, but he has previously praised this blood-soaked tyrant. However, I would be the first to oppose any effort to bar him from the ice due to his political views (as tempting as they may be at the next game against Chicago). Unlike the Met, hockey officials generally supported the players. Yet, Gelb bizarrely says, ""Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward.""    Video No way forward? How about a free speech path where you allow an artist to perform for her art alone. Gelb and others can then use their free speech to condemn Putin or criticize Netrebko without silencing her on the stage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Netrebko has publicly stated, ""I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression, and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now to save all of us. We need peace right now."" Even that statement should not be necessary as a condition for her to perform. Are all opera singers now expected to repeat mantra-like the view of the Met or the majority?   Video When many artists opposed the Vietnam War, there was widespread support for their free speech rights in opposing blacklisting. The same was true during the McCarthy period. Now, the very same people who celebrate such struggles as defining moments in our history are seeking to cancel artists for their political views. In this case, Netrebko is not even being targeted for saying something offensive but rather for not repeating the position of the majority on the war.  Years ago, I wrote that there was a dangerous trend toward compelled speech: ""The line between punishing speech and compelling speech is easily crossed when free speech itself is viewed as a threat."" We appear to have crossed that line. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the end, the Met succeeded in silencing a talented artist because she would not use her voice to support the view of the majority. In doing so, the Met embraced orthodoxy over art. I have previously noted that the growing anti-free speech movement among artists and writers is self-destructive. Artists against free speech is like athletes against fitness. Artists need free speech to be able to create and perform freely. To see artists leading an anti-free speech movement is a form of self-condemnation. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY  ",2022-03

I would take nothing off the table, but I would be very clear that we are going to support the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian president, his government every way humanly possible. Zelenskyy was very clear, he says we don’t need you to fight our fight, we don’t need you to fly our planes or fly your planes into our war zone.

   NATO  members have a ""green light"" to send fighter jets as part of their military aid to support  Ukraine  against the  Russian  invasion, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday. ""That gets a green light,"" Blinken said in an interview with CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""  ""In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if in fact they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians,"" Blinken added.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES The decision comes amid a push to provide weapons for Ukrainian forces as they continue to fight against the superior firepower of the Russians.  The U.S. has been reportedly considering a deal with  Poland  to send U.S. warplanes to Warsaw to replace any Soviet-era fighter jets the NATO country sends to Ukraine.  Under the proposal , the Ukrainians would receive Russian-made MiGs that Poland inherited after the Cold War ended, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Schumer said he supported the U.S. giving other nations – like Poland -- help if they decide to supply Ukraine with Soviet-era jets.  Schumer noted the jets are owned by Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe and that Ukrainian pilots are trained to use them. ""These planes and other capabilities are very much needed,"" Schumer said, according to the  New York Post . ""Today, I am urging the administration to explore all feasible options for the transfer of these specific aircraft to Ukraine."" ""The US could commit to helping restore a donor country’s fleet in return for the transfer, and I offer up full support for this to happen,"" he added. ""We must help Ukraine from the ongoing Russian bombardment and siege with planes, and other capabilities."" Meanwhile, Zelenskyy's call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine continues to draw no support.  In a video posted to Twitter Sunday morning, Zelenskyy delivered a message bearing subtitles in English that said, ""We repeat everyday: ‘Close the sky over Ukraine!'"" The White House said it has not agreed to the no-fly restrictions because they want to keep the U.S. out of direct conflict with Russia.  Russian President Vladimir Putin  said that Moscow will view any attempt by other countries to establish a no-fly zone as active "" participation in the armed conflict ."" ""The reason why that has not been a step the President has been willing to take or we have been interested in taking is because a no-fly zone requires implementation. It would require, essentially, the U.S. military shooting down Russian planes and causing a —  prompting a potential direct war with Russia, something  — the exact step that we want to avoid,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing Thursday.  US, POLAND IN TALKS TO HELP UKRAINE ACQUIRE WARPLANES On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Yael Eckstein, president and CEO of The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ), told Fox News Digital via an email exchange this weekend amid her latest trip to Europe that she ""thought she had seen it all."" She elaborated, ""I have worked in  the humanitarian aid field  for over 16 years. I thought I had seen it all. But in the past seven days,"" she added — referring to Russia's assault on Ukraine — ""I have witnessed suffering and desperation that I have never seen in my lifetime."" Eckstein said that for her, ""the most heartbreaking thing was seeing orphans whom The Fellowship supports [caught] in the middle of a war zone.""  RUSSIA ATTACKS UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Amid that suffering and desperation, however, comes a dramatic story of planning, escape, care and — at least for now — a semblance of calm during the storm that is most of Ukraine right now. And it wouldn't have happened if not for the support, the prayers and the help of many people, including those who have donated to important charities over the years.  Rescue flight: Sunday, March 6  The Fellowship shared with Fox News Digital details of the successful rescue of about 100 children from Ukraine over the past few days — and the latest news about where they've landed.  UKRAINE MOTHER DESCRIBES RUSSIA'S ATTACKS AS ‘EVIL’ It all began in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, where a woman named Malcki Bukiat was running an orphanage for children from ""socially challenged families,"" The Fellowship reported to Fox News Digital. Some of these children are orphans; others had parents who couldn't care for them. For the bulk of the year — from the age of 4 years old until age 17 — the students lived at the orphanage.     
      Yael Eckstein is a mother of four and president of The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. She and members of her team and others helped arrange for the dramatic rescue of children and orphans from Ukraine on Sunday, March 6, 2022, amid the tragedy and violence of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. 
       Yet when the war on Ukraine began, Bukiat ""found herself responsible for the lives of the children at the orphanage,"" as well as for the children of two other Jewish families that lived together with the school community — plus her own five children.  Said Bukiat, ""We knew the situation [was] very dangerous. We saw that it became even worse in the last day, before we left. We were theoretically ready to take the kids toward the border — but, practically, it was very complicated.""  Awakening to the sound of explosions one morning at 5 a.m., Bukiat said she knew she had to evacuate the children immediately.

       (REUTERS/Maksim Levin/File Photo) ""When you have to organize a trip of nearly 60 children — not including [your own] children [and other children] — with their basic needs, their documents and the papers from families, and at the same time you have to try to keep them calm and mentally balanced, it is not easy,"" she said.  ""It took us a couple of hours. We told the kids to take only the most important things: clothes, personal medicines. We prepared some food for the way, as we knew the way was going to be very long,"" she added. ""And we left Zhytomyr, moving to the west, in [a] bus."" ""The [children] were very scared and some of them cried"" during the trip westward.    The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, along with Chabad, planned this rescue mission for these children. The group mapped out the route based on what they knew about the path and the terrain — and about the bombings that were going on in Ukraine. A journey of hope — toward safety  Bukiat shared that during this bus trip, ""it was very difficult to keep the children calm. They were not used to seeing tanks, military vehicles and soldiers. They were very scared and some of them cried,"" she said.  ""They needed us to support them, and we had to convey calmness to protect them from trauma."" The trip took 15 hours, Bukiat said.      
      These Ukrainian children and others were evacuated from the Zhytomyr children's home — and in this image, are shown sheltering in Chernovtsi, in western Ukraine.
       (The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews) ""The traffic jam was endless. Thousands of people were trying to escape to the borders. People were out of gas, food and water,"" she said.  ""Some of these [travelers] had been [on the road] for three days or more,"" she said, ""hiding from bombs and rockets in the open areas because they couldn’t arrive [at proper] shelters."" She said that ""in the gas station, each vehicle could buy only 10 liters of gas. Thank God, we had our gas tank full.""  ADOPTIVE MOM SHARES MESSAGE FOR PUTIN: ‘UKRAINE IS UKRAINE! LET IT BE’ Throughout this rough journey, things were ""not easy"" for Bukiat, she said. She finally realized that she needed help. So ""I gathered the elder children, ages 14-15, and I [told] them I needed them to take care of the little ones. Everybody got an important role, and they did a fantastic job. We declared that our slogan was ‘everybody for everybody,’ and the children acted according to this principle.""     
      Children from an orphanage in Zhytomyr (in western Ukraine) are shown here. A rabbi reported that 60 children, ages 6-17, were evacuated on Feb. 24 to Chernivtsi, which is close to the border with Moldova. The children woke up on Feb. 24, 2022, to sounds of explosions. They decided to act immediately to evacuate all the children to a safer region. They tried to organize another bus for Jewish families in Zhytomyr to send them even further west. IFCJ has supported this children's home for many years.
       (The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews) She said they drove through open areas, ""and it was scary. We passed checkpoints, we met some other people and I could not always be sure if they were harmless or dangerous,"" she added.  ""The [journey] was challenging. We prayed a lot.""  Bukiat said the group then ""finally arrived at the area of the [Carpathian] mountains, where Chabad members rented us a hotel. The first thing we needed"" to do, she said, was ""get some necessities — clothes, toothpaste, shampoo — all the different things that the kids [had left behind, at the orphanage]."" PRAYERS FOR UKRAINE: AMERICAN FAITH LEADERS SHARE FERVENT CONCERNS   After that, she said the adults created ""a day program that was the closest we could do to the one they were used to. The best way to calm the children,"" she said wisely, ""was to bring them back to their routine.""     
      Some of the travelers who made their way from an orphanage in western Ukraine, amid the shellings and bombings from Russia, are shown here — with the ultimate goal of safely reaching Israel, where people were waiting to help them and care for them during this traumatic time. 
       (The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews) Bukiat said that on Sunday, however, she ""began to feel that the situation [had become even] worse than before. We heard more explosions and people who came to the hotel told us that this area wasn't safe anymore. We decided that there was no choice — we [had] to take the kids to the other side of the border."" The group made its way to Romania, across the border — and Bukiat reported that there, all the children were ""safe."" From that point, the group prepared to fly to Israel. UKRAINE'S ORPHANS ARE TOP OF MIND FOR ADOPTIVE DAD AND HIS ORGANIZATION Bukiat shared this important note about the treacherous trip: ""You know, I didn’t [see] any difference between my own biological children and the schoolchildren. We were raised on the Jewish brotherhood principle — every Jew is precious to me. You ask me if I was scared at some point. Yes, I was, of course.""     
      This little one got out of Ukraine safely, with the help of many people and multiple organizations. 
       (The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews) Yet ""I am a believing woman,"" she added. ""And, you know, you can believe in God and you can fully trust God."" She said she fully ""trusted God"" and said she felt that ""everything [would] be all right."" Final leg to Israel ""These innocent children endured days of fear and treacherous travel,"" said members of The Fellowship. The groups worked nonstop for days preparing for the trip. ""I shed tears of joy when I heard they crossed the border out of Ukraine,"" said Yael Eckstein.   On Sunday, March 6, the children finally arrived in Israel, via several flights. The trip was a joint operation by Israel’s Aliyah and Absorption Ministry, the Jewish Agency, and The Fellowship, the latter group explained.      
      The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews was one of the groups that helped arrange this successful flight amid multiple challenges in Ukraine. Vulnerable Ukrainian children are now being cared for in Israel.
       (The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews) The Fellowship also told Fox News Digital that it worked tirelessly with government officials to ensure that the children had the travel documentation necessary for the trip.  Upon arrival, they were greeted by The Fellowship's Eckstein — as well as by Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. EVERYDAY UKRAINIANS STRUGGLE TO STAY ALIVE, ARE GRATEFUL FOR HELP, PRAYERS The orphans will be staying, for now at least, at a school campus in Israel. The Fellowship team is providing ""immediate temporary housing and aid for their basic essentials,"" the group said. In total, approximately 300 immigrants made it safely to Israel as part of this overall operation.

       (The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews/Office of the Prime Minister of Israel) ""Thank God that generous friends, especially Christians, had already provided over $3 million to help Ukraine's Jews over the last week,"" Eckstein told Fox News Digital earlier.  ""We are so grateful they've helped us help them — but we're going to need more."" ‘Blessed to be able to bring them home' Eckstein also told Fox News Digital, ""I followed their evacuation closely from Israel, with anticipation and prayer. I shed tears of joy when I heard they crossed the border out of Ukraine."" ""Now,"" she added, ""The Fellowship is so blessed to be able to bring them home to Israel, where they will be cared for and loved."" She said her Fellowship group was able ""to do this lifesaving work quickly and effectively because we’ve been on the ground in the former Soviet Union for 30 years."" Added Eckstein, ""We have the vast network of staff, partners and volunteers to get things done efficiently and effectively, even in a time of war.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The war in  Ukraine  is another indicator of our new cold war, which pits the U.S. and its allies against what I label the alliance of evil, Russia and China, which will create levels of anxiety not experienced since the end of the old Cold War. This new cold war is different from the old war which was mostly about ideology, communism versus democracy, pitting the U.S. and the former Soviet Union in a death struggle. Today’s conflict is between opposing world views, liberty versus authoritarianism. RUSSIA SEEKING ‘LEVERAGE’ BY SEIZING NUCLEAR POWER PLANT: US DEFENSE OFFICIAL     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin during their meeting in Moscow, Russia.
       (Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) The old Cold War rose from the ashes of World War II. Recall that President Franklin Roosevelt aligned us with Soviet Russia only because Adolf Hitler attacked Russia, which temporarily put aside our concerns about the communist regime. However, tensions quickly rose after the war when Russia seized much of Eastern Europe and detonated a nuclear bomb, which resurrected then-fresh memories of our devastating bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cold War paranoia of a Soviet invasion and nuclear annihilation impacted our lives at school and work with mandated duck-and-cover drills, evacuations, and the sound of air raid sirens. Families built backyard fallout shelters, communities designated air raid facilities and the government proliferated educational films on how to survive a nuclear blast. There were warnings about communists in government which fed suspicions even about our neighbors’ sympathies. Tension increased as the nuclear arms race reached a pinnacle in 1962 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev sent nuclear-tipped missiles to Cuba. President John F. Kennedy responded by blockading Russian ships heading to Cuba. That confrontation was the closest the Cold War came to escalating to a full-scale Armageddon.   Video The arms race also was linked with our space programs. In 1961, the Soviets put Yuri Gagarin into orbit, shocking the world and the U.S. responded by accelerating our program because of a concern the Russians would militarize space. Fortunately, the U.S. and Russia never directly fought the other. However, the period was marked by proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, Cambodia and Congo. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan came to office just in time to demonstrate unflinching fortitude and clarity of aim to lead the West to end the Cold War, by addressing the fight on many fronts. Most importantly Reagan knew that any appeasement to Moscow was as good as aiding a ruthless enemy. Today, a new existential conflict is threatening the world thanks to the alignment of the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation. Last month, China’s President Xi Jinping and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin met in Beijing, where they released a joint communiqué, which former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) labeled ""… a declaration of ideological and geopolitical war against the US….""   Video There are at least 6 indicators of that new cold war, which I address in my 2018 book, ""Alliance of Evil."" Consider some recent examples of Chinese and Russian behavior associated with a few of those indicators. Diplomatic indicator Relations between the U.S. and both Russia and China are in the toilet. For example, on Feb. 26, 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, said Moscow may react to Western sanctions imposed for the Ukraine invasion by severing all diplomatic ties. World order indicator Many Western leaders indicate that China and Russia are seeking to ""replace the existing international rules"" with their own. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Moscow of a ""blatant attempt"" to revamp global order. She said that Russia and China want to ""replace the existing international rules – they prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination."" Economic indicator Both Russia and China are persistent violators of economic and trade agreements. China seeks ascendancy as the world’s dominant producer of industrial goods and is doing that by violating many World Trade Organization rules, cornering global markets on key commodities, conducting financial warfare using mercantilist behaviors and manipulating its currency. President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, that touches many countries, is a ""debt trap,"" according to British MI6 chief, Richard Moore. It leaves behind half-built bridges, overbudget railways and mountains of debt, Moore said.   Video Defense budget indicator Both Russia and China spend more of their gross domestic product on defense than the global average, and much of their security investment is hidden, which makes comparisons with the U.S. meaningless. Chinese defense spending has dramatically increased each year (15.8%) over the past three decades, by more than 250% over the past decade, according to IHS Janes. China’s defense budget amounts to 2.5% of GDP, according to the Pentagon. Large, sophisticated military indicator Thanks to heavy investment, both Russia and China are building large and sophisticated militaries to contest the US on a peer basis. The Pentagon’s 2021 report on China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) indicates it fields the largest force in the world and seeks ""complete PLA modernization by 2035."" Further, as evidence of its global ambitions, the ""PLA [is] developing capabilities to conduct joint long-range precision strikes across domains, increasingly sophisticated space, counterspace, and cyber capabilities, and accelerating the large-scale expansion of its nuclear forces.""   Video Nuclear forces indicator Although Russia has a giant nuclear arsenal (6,800 warheads), and threatens to abandon the New START treaty which limits each country, China is creating a serious new threat. The PLA is modernizing and rapidly expanding its nuclear forces – land, sea and air delivery platforms. It has increased it capacity to produce plutonium-239, necessary to build nuclear weapons. Further, the 2021 Pentagon report indicates the regime is expected to accelerate weapons production to at least 1,000 warheads by 2030.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   ""I’ve read most of everything he’s written,""  President Biden  said of  Russian  President  Vladimir Putin  last month. ""He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about."" Many experts believe that Biden is right. In an often cited and perhaps highly revealing comment years ago, Putin said that he believed the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.  Putin currently has his hands full with a stronger-than-expected resistance to his war on Ukraine – including at home – though his massive military is expected to eventually prevail. Most believe, however, that it's not a matter of if, but rather when and where, the Russian president begins pressuring, coercing or attacking other countries as he tries to reconstitute something akin to the Soviet Union. The Baltics Many are keeping one eye on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as Putin wages his war on Ukraine. That's because the three Baltic States sit sandwiched between Russia, its close ally Belarus, the Baltic Sea and the Russian territory of Kaliningrad.      
      A map shows the boundaries of the former Soviet Union, with NATO ""Baltic"" states highlighted. Many speculate those countries could face covert action and cyberattacks from Russia soon.
       (Fox News) RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Because all three countries are NATO members, it's not expected that Putin would take physically aggressive action against them, according to Penn State professor emerita of political science  Donna Bahry .  ""The Baltics are vulnerable, but a direct Russian military strike against NATO countries seems unlikely for now,"" Bahry told Fox News Digital. ""That doesn’t rule out Russian efforts such as cyberattacks and other covert actions. In fact, all three Baltic countries have experienced cyberattacks from Russia for some years."" Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler also told Fox News Digital that a military attack is highly unlikely. But she said Putin may hit the Baltics with ""non-kinetic actions"" that could include not only cyberattacks but electronic warfare, ""any kind of destabilization like covert ops,"" or even staging a protest. ""He is not gonna go with military operations or any kind of kinetic action against any NATO country such as the Baltics,"" she said. ""But as the conflict escalates, and especially if he's on the losing side, I fully expect him to ratchet up non-kinetic actions."" RUSSIA HIKES KEY RATE TO 20%, TELLS COMPANIES TO SELL FX R Street Institute Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats Director Tatyana Bolton, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that while Putin's timeline may not be immediate, she believes Putin wants to eventually gain control of the Baltics. She said the West should do everything in its power to salvage Ukraine, which she said would be key to deterring any future Putin attack on the Baltics.

       (Yuri Kochetkov/Pool Photo via AP) ""This could take months or years, but I think that's exactly what he's trying to do. He's trying to take one piece at a time to reassemble what he believes was the greatest country in the world,"" Bolton said.  Koffler also said it's highly unlikely Russia would take kinetic action soon against other NATO members or any other ""truly Western country."" This would include, she said, non-NATO members Finland and Sweden, despite speculation about Putin's interest in the Swedish island of Gotland.  Other post-Soviet states   Moldova and Georgia may face a more immediate threat than the Baltics, Bahry and Koffler said.  Any area where the Russians have their quote-unquote peacekeeping forces… or anything that has disputed territory [is vulnerable].   — Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler ""Will Putin now move quickly against other post-Soviet states? More military attacks on other post-Soviet countries seem unlikely for now,"" Bahry said. ""But Putin could ramp up pressure on the countries with closer ties to the EU, such as Moldova and Georgia -- for example, by recognizing the independence of Transnistria or annexing South Ossetia."" Koffler said those former Soviet states are indeed ""vulnerable,"" because they are not in NATO and because they have disputed territory. UKRAINE FM SLAMS ‘TRAITORS TO HUMANITY’ FOR LEAVING RUSSIA SWIFT LOOPHOLES: ‘MONEY SOAKED IN OUR BLOOD’ ""Definitely a threat to Moldova,"" Koffler said. ""Any area where the Russians have their quote-unquote peacekeeping forces… or anything that has disputed territory such as Transnistria in Moldova, such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia."" Koffler said those areas ""could be on the target list, including on this phase of the operation, especially if he is perceiving that he's on the losing side."" What could hold Putin back from going after those areas, Koffler said, is the fact so much of his military is preoccupied in Ukraine for now.      
      The boundaries of the former Soviet Union are shown on a map. Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler said any former Soviet state that's not in NATO is vulnerable to Russian action right now. 
       (Fox News) What the West can do Despite the fact that kinetic action is unlikely, Koffler said it is still critical to ""shore up"" the Baltics with Western troops. But she said that must be done carefully ""so that Putin doesn't interpret our actions as offensive instead of defensive… Remember, he's paranoid.""  Retired CIA station chief Dan Hoffman also acknowledged the trouble with the perception of NATO building up troops in the Baltics. He said a buildup of Western forces in those three states bordering Russia would feed into the ""enemy at the gates"" propaganda Putin uses on his people. But, Hoffman said, it's still critical to increase the western military presence in the Baltics.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Even if there’s a 2% chance Putin invades Estonia, you better be there and ready with a whole lot of troops or else that’s 100% of you getting your a-- kicked,"" he said. Bahry said ""NATO would have difficulty countering a direct Russian strike on the Baltics right now,"" but that the SWIFT sanctions the West is imposing are ""a big step."" In the long term, Bahry said, energy independence may be the West's best move to counter Russia.  ""European countries should be diversifying both the types and supplies of energy they use, to reduce dependence on Russian gas exports,"" she said. ""That’s not just an energy security issue for Europe. It’s also a way to reduce the flow of revenue going to the Russian government and its military.""  ",2022-03

Think about that.  … What does this have to do with the United States? Do you think Putin is going to be happy with Ukraine, any more than he was happy with Crimea, any more than he was happy with Georgia? He’s told us what he wants to do!

   The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes after  Russian  President Vladimir Putin approved a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Feb. 24, a somber reminder of the number of war crimes committed over the last century. The  United Nations  says that war crimes  must  occur during an armed conflict, and examples may include murder, cruel treatment and torture, taking of hostages, intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, and more. One expert previously told Fox News Digital that the ICC will investigate potential war crimes committed by individuals. ""With respect to the situation in Ukraine, the ICC prosecutor may investigate allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide,"" Dustin Lewis, research director at the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict, said.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In other words, it may institute proceedings only against individual humans. The ICC has no jurisdiction over the entities with which those humans may be affiliated, such as a government or a military,"" he added. Here's a look at some war crimes of the past century: Armenian Genocide From 1915 to 1916, hundreds of thousands of Armenians died after the Ottoman Turks began mass deportations from eastern Anatolia, which resulted in mass numbers of people dying from starvation or disease, according to the  BBC . Before beginning the mass deportations, the Young Turk regime hanged hundreds of Armenians in the streets of Istanbul, according to Yale University. The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that the number of deaths were ""more than a million,"" but that number is disputed. Armenians claim that the number of deaths is 1.5 million, while the Republic of Turkey says that it's 300,000. Multiple senior Ottoman officials were tried in connection with the genocide. For example, Mehmed Kemal, a local governor, was found guilty at the trial and was hanged for his involvement in the mass killing of Armenians, according to the report. While Turkey doesn't deny the staggering number of Armenian deaths, its government says that the ""Armenian deaths do not constitute genocide,"" according to Radio Free Europe.

       (Photo by Hayk Baghdasaryan\TASS via Getty Images) German War Crimes during World War II While many war crimes were committed during World War II, the most heinous was the Holocaust, when the Nazi German regime killed six million European Jews. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler considered the Jews an inferior race who were a threat to German racial purity, and enacted laws that targeted Jews, excluding them from German society, according to the United States Holocaust Museum. In September 1941, every person designated as a Jew in Nazi Germany was required to wear a yellow star, which made them a target, according to  History.com . Between 1941 and 1945, during World War II, Nazi Germany began the Holocaust death camps, where six million Jews were killed. Officials in Germany transported Jews to these death camps, where they were deprived of food, water, bathrooms, heat, and medical care, according to the  United States Holocaust Museum . It wasn't until May 1945 when the Holocaust came to an end, when the Allied Powers began to overrun concentration camps and then liberate those who had survived, according to the museum. Algerian War The Algerian National Liberation Front fought France between 1954 and 1962 in the Algerian War, and historians estimate that around 250,000 to 300,000 Algerians died during the war, the  University of North Carolina  says. In 1954, the National Liberation Front launched a number of armed revolts throughout the country and demanded that the nation be declared independent, and France sent troops to the country to monitor the situation, according to  the Atlantic . By August 1945, the National Liberation Front targeted civilians and incited a mob that killed more than 120 people, according to the report. In response, French troops and ""vigilante committees"" killed between 1,200 and 12,000 Muslims. After years of battles and hundreds of thousands of civilians killed, the French declared a ceasefire and the Algerian people voted to become independent of France in 1962. One French officer, Paul Aussaresses, admitted to torturing as well as killing Algerian prisoners of war, according to the  BBC . A French court convicted Aussaresses of defending the usage of torture in 2002. The post-war amnesty prevented Aussaresses and others from being tried for war crimes, according to the BBC. Russo-Georgian War The Russo-Georgian war began on August 8, 2008, when  Russian  forces moved into Georgia and began the first war in Europe of the 21st century, according to the  Atlantic Council . During the conflict, which lasted five days, several hundred civilians and military members died, according to the  Brookings Institute , but the fighting displaced between 100,000 and 200,000 individuals. The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into war crimes committed during the war, but has faced several challenges. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in January 2021 that Russia was responsible for several human rights violations during the war, which includes murdering Georgian civilians, as well as looting and burning homes, according to the  Guardian .

The war, which lasted 20 months, killed an estimated maximum of 100,000 people. It lasted from 1994 to 1996. The second war between Russia and Chechnya began in the summer of 1999, as Chechen fighters battled with troops from Russia on the border of Chechnya-Dagestan, according to the BBC. During that summer, the Chechen rebels battled in Dagestan in an attempt to create an Islamic state. The second war went from 1999 to 2000, with Russia declaring direct rule over the country. Human Rights Watch alleged that Russian forces committed ""grave abuses,"" which include war crimes, during the war. In a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Peter Bouckaert, a researcher at  Human Rights Watch , presented evidence of the war crimes. Bouckaert stated that Russian forces conducted a ""carpet-bombing campaign,"" which resulted in the ""vast majority"" of civilian deaths during the war. ""The Russian forces have used powerful surface-to-surface rockets on numerous occasions, causing death tolls in the hundreds in the Central Market bombing in Grozny and in many smaller towns and villages,"" Bouckaert said.  He added that Russian forces turned much of Chechnya into a ""wasteland.""

   Vladimir Putin  could never rest easy without the Russian flag flying over Kyiv. Never doubt for a second that Xi Jinping feels the same way about Taiwan. The president of China certainly hopes, in his lifetime, to see the communist flag flutter above Taipei. So the obvious question is whether the current conflict holds any lessons for  China and its cause . It does – but they might not be the ones Beijing expected.   Video Putin would not have  moved on Ukraine  if he didn’t think a weakened, distracted and divided Europe, paired with a feckless American president, would not stand in his way. The response from Beijing, of course, was – what’s not to like? Putin was doing Xi’s dirty work for him. A rattled Europe would be more open to Chinese efforts to expand its influence in Europe, as well as push out and marginalize the Americans. DEFENDING RELIGION IN UKRAINE – RUSSIA'S PUTIN DISTORTS SHARED CHRISTIAN ROOTS TO JUSTIFY WAR But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the time is right to take Taiwan. For one thing, China already thinks the West is weak. Nothing that has happened in the last few days gives it any reason to advance its own timeline. Consider as well the logistics problem. As Asia expert Walter Lohman has noted, ""Unlike Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Chinese move on Taiwan involves it getting past hundreds of miles of water."" If Beijing wants to take Taiwan by force, it won’t act until it’s convinced it can win decisively and quickly. Beijing thinks the West is only going to get weaker, so time is on its side.   Video RUSSIA ANNOUNCES CEASEFIRE TO ALLOW FOR EVACUATIONS: LIVE UPDATES The lessons Xi and his cronies are learning, however might not be the ones they saw coming.  What happens when victories are not quick and decisive? Putin may well conquer Ukraine, but if he does, it will only be after an expensive, debilitating campaign that devastates his conquests while delivering a staggering hammer blow to his own economy. Win or lose, Putin will have big burden to bear. The lesson for Beijing may be to wait a bit.    Beijing is also learning lessons about the value of Putin as ally. Rather than dividing and weakening Europe, Putin has given NATO a reason to be NATO again. European countries are stepping up to spend more on defense. Congress is likely to press the Biden administration to strengthen both the U.S. military’s conventional and strategic posture. Beijing has also had to spend geopolitical capital to side with Russia. Fending off responsibility for the Uyghur genocide (which they can hide behind the Great Firewall) is one thing, but defending Russian war crimes, which play out on Twitter and YouTube, guts China’s credibility of claims that it’s a ""responsible"" power.   Video Further, Beijing’s buddy in Moscow is going to be an economic basketcase. Even if Beijing wants to bail them out with their patent debt trap, that is going to cost a lot of money – likely more than the Chinese Communist Party can spare. Buying up Russia at fire-sale prices might be more than even Xi can manage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Here is an even bigger lesson Xi did not anticipate. He has been thrilled to watch the West commit economic suicide with its ""climate action"" plan that impoverishes their economies (while doing little to address climate issues) even as the China economy thrives, powered by ever more coal-fired plants. What if this war actually causes the West to wake up and adopt policies that deliver reliable, affordable and abundant energy (without Russian oil and gas)?   Video Let’s be honest. Even before Putin attacked Ukraine, Beijing was right to think the West was in the process of geopolitical suicide. Not one Western leader showed Putin any backbone. They still cling to their climate-action nonsense. We still talk a lot about protecting supply chains, and then Congress offers to subsidize costs for high-tech companies knee-deep in China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yet the resistance in the Ukraine has stirred some buried truth in the West, like being dead asleep and then shocked awake – a reminder that if we don’t defend our freedom, safety and prosperity, no one will. The lesson for Beijing may be to wait a bit. They may well decide to wait and see what happens after the Ukraine war: if the West returns to its geostrategic slumbers or if defending the free world becomes a new reality in the post-modern world. You can bet Xi will be rooting for the former. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JAMES JAY CARAFANO  ",2022-03

       ""The American people were left aghast by President Biden's disregard for the thousands of Americans he left behind in Afghanistan, as even one American left behind is too many,"" Killmeyer, who spent  four years at Deloitte , much of that time advising a federal agency on supply-chain risk management, added in a press release first sent to Fox News Digital.  ""Right now, two Americans are wrongfully detained in Russia.

Biden  mentioned their cases  in a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2021.

       (Associated Press) Killmeyer praised  former President Donald Trump , who secured the release of notable hostages such as  Pastor Andrew Brunson  from Turkey. ""Unlike President Trump, President Biden continues failing to prioritize American hostages and the high number of wrongfully detained Americans around the world,"" Killmeyer added. He also called on Biden to combat Russia in the energy sector. ""In the meantime, President Biden must establish leverage over Russia reversing his misguided restrictions on oil and gas production, and finally sanctioning oil and gas produced in Russia,"" Killmeyer said.

The ad calls on viewers to call their member of Congress to tell them to ""support America’s security instead of Russia’s terror."" REPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN STOP FUNDING PUTIN'S WAR WITH OIL PURCHASES Pence's ad buy comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been pushing legislation to ban oil imports from Russia, and Republicans, especially, have been calling for more domestic oil and gas production in the wake of Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.   The most recent data from the  U.S. Energy Information Administration  show that in December, the U.S. imported 405,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia or almost 5% of all U.S. imports for the month. That's down from about 800,000 barrels in August.  The largest exporters of energy to the United States are Canada and Mexico.  Democrats have called for a federal gas tax holiday as a possible solution for alleviating prices, while Republicans want expanded domestic oil drilling. And some critics have accused the Biden administration of funding Russian Putin’s war on Ukraine by cutting down domestic oil production and relying on Russian oil. White House press secretary Jen Psaki last week said ""a wide range of options remain on the table,"" when asked about potentially reopening the Keystone XL pipeline to minimize energy dependence abroad, but reiterated Biden’s concerns surrounding U.S. energy prices. PELOSI FAVORS BANNING ALL RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES ""This Keystone pipeline, it would take years for that to have an impact on prices,"" Psaki said. ""Obviously, there are a range of reasons why the president opposes it, but it wasn't functioning, isn't functioning. It would take years. There are also 9,000 approved oil leases that oil companies are not tapping into."" ""So yes, we all want to take steps to address any raise in gas prices that impact the American people,"" she continued. ""But we should be very clear about what policies will help and what policies will not help."" And on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the U.S. is considering a ban on Russian oil imports ""in coordination"" with European and NATO allies amid bipartisan calls for a full embargo while Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. Speaking from the  former Soviet republic of Moldova  on CNN's  "" State of the Union ,"" Blinken said the administration was looking at the ""prospect"" of banning Russian oil imports ""in a coordinated way"" with allies, while making sure there is still enough oil on the global market, but he declined to elaborate on how that could be accomplished.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   As the  Russia-Ukraine war  continues, American cities with ""Sister City"" partnerships in Ukraine are helping their counterparts by agreeing to take in refugees, encouraging people to donate to helpful organizations and in some cases, even sending volunteers to help with humanitarian efforts. Yulia Skuibida, 39, is originally from Kyiv and has lived in  Chicago  for the last 17 years.  Skuibida is a member of the Kyiv Committee of Chicago Sister Cities International and after Russia invaded Ukraine, she traveled to Poland, where she has been helping with humanitarian relief at the Ukraine border. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""Sister cities"" are partnerships between two cities in two different countries. These partnerships can focus on culture, education, business and other exchanges between the cities. Chicago has been sister cities with Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, since 1991, according to Chicago Sister Cities International. ""I could not stay at home. When I saw there was bombing in Kyiv, I was just devastated.""   Skuibida told Fox News Digital that she’s been a part of the Kyiv Committee of Chicago Sister Cities International for five years and, before the pandemic, had started to work on a project between the cities to share information and ideas for how to make Kyiv more accessible to people who use wheelchairs or have other disabilities. The project had to be paused because of the pandemic, Skuibida said. Now, Skuibida is working with the Kyiv Committee of Chicago Sister Cities International to bring help to Ukrainians.  ""I could not stay at home,"" Skuibida said. ""When I saw there was bombing in Kyiv, I was just devastated.""   Volunteer work just beginning in Ukraine Skuibida told Fox that almost immediately after hearing of Russia’s invasion, she decided to go to Poland. She arrived on Feb. 24 and started by helping refugees at the border. Since then, she has helped fill other needs as well. ""It’s changing every day, what I’m doing here,"" Skuibida told Fox. Skuibida is now focused on getting supplies to the military in Ukraine – even just ""the basics"" such as boots and sleeping bags, she said – and gathering medical supplies to send to a medical clinic in Kyiv. ""We rented two vans and we are receiving certain supplies from Chicago,"" Skuibida said. ""So people are actually flying here to bring [the supplies] as fast as possible because that’s the fastest way.""   After receiving the supplies from Chicago, Skuibida said she is driving them to the Ukraine border and sending them ""to the cities that need it."" Skuibida is also coordinating with outside volunteers to buy supplies throughout Poland and other areas of Europe and bring those to Ukraine. For Skuibida, it’s important to help Ukraine, not just as a Ukrainian native, but also as a member of the Kyiv Committee of Chicago Sister Cities International. ""It’s great when everything is great, and we can have a cultural exchange in different cities,"" Skuibida said. ""But what are we doing when one of the cities is actually in trouble? I think that is the perfect opportunity for the sister cities to unite and provide as much help as possible.""   Skuibida left Poland on Sunday [March 6] to return home to Chicago. She said she expects she’ll be back within a week because there’s still more to do. UKRAINE’S CHILDREN: HOW TO HELP VULNERABLE KIDS AMID RUSSIA’S ATTACK Chicago announced Tuesday that it had suspended its sister city relationship with Moscow ""to send a strong message that Chicago denounces all actions by the Putin regime,"" according to a Facebook post from the Kyiv Committee of Chicago Sister Cities International.  UKRAINIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM UNITES THE WORLD AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR The committee is also working with the Ukrainain consulate in the city to send bulletproof vests to Ukrainians, according to a report from FOX 32.

       (Pete Marovich/Getty Images) What will happen with Sister Cities and Russia? The U.S. has approximately 18 official Ukrainian sister cities, according to the 2019 Sister Cities International membership directory, which is the most recent directory on the website. ""Today we will say loudly and clearly that to all victims of this violence and aggression, we stand with you.""   A spokesperson for Sister Cities International told Fox News Digital in an email that the organization has not given any special advice to sister city members on how to help their Ukrainian counterparts because those relationships are so individualized. The organization has encouraged cities that are members of Sister Cities International to continue their partnerships with Russian cities ""to promote citizen diplomacy,"" the spokesperson said. In a letter provided to Fox News Digital, Leroy Allala, the president and CEO of Sister Cities International, explained why sister city members should maintain their relationships with Russian cities, despite the war in Ukraine.  HUMANITARIAN AID EXPERT REVEALS DRAMATIC RESCUE OF UKRAINIANS ""As citizen diplomats, we must be alert to counsel and remind our elected officials as well as our local municipal leaders of the critical role that Sister Cities International and each local sister city relationship offers, especially in times of conflict,"" Allala wrote to members of Sister Cities International.  He continued: ""We applaud those sister cities programs and citizens around the globe, including in Russia, who have voiced their support of an independent Ukraine and reaffirmed their belief in peace through mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation."" UKRAINIAN ANIMAL SANCTUARY EVACUATES ANIMALS TO POLISH ZOO: REPORT ""While suspending or ending a sister city relationship to register disapproval of a foreign government's actions may seem, on the surface, like a positive policy protest action, it has the complete opposite effect – closing a vital and, ofttimes, last channel of communication with vulnerable or isolated populations,"" Allala added.  Chicago isn’t the only U.S. city offering help to Ukraine Modesto, California, which has been a sister city to Khmelnytskyi, since 1987, shared a list of ways people can help Ukraine on the Modesto Sister Cities International Facebook page.    Meanwhile, Rockford, Illinois, which has been a sister city to Brovary, Ukraine, since 1995, hosted a prayer service for Ukraine on Monday.    Tacoma, Washington, which is also a sister city to Brovary, also held a peace vigil on Monday and is collecting donations to help the people of Brovary, according to Facebook posts.    Last week, Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval announced that he had offered help to Cincinnati’s sister city, Kharkiv, which has been  hit hard by Russian attacks . During the Feb. 24 city council meeting, Pureval addressed ""the tragic events of last night and today in our sister city of Kharkiv and in cities across Ukraine.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   ""These were innocent, peaceful civilians in a nation that had shown no aggression, subjected to an unjustifiable and unprovoked attack by Russian military forces,"" Pureval said. ""Since 1989 Kharkiv has been a sister city to Cincinnati and residents have exchanged ideas, educational opportunities and collaborative projects on culture, medicine and human rights."" ""We pray for the safety of our sister city, of all its residents and of all Ukrainian citizens during this dark time,"" he added.

   Americans want Joe Biden to stop the  slaughter in Ukraine .   They want to see that the United States – home to the greatest military force in the world and the globe’s biggest economy – cannot be cowed by a  thug in the Kremlin . They want to believe that a unified West can fight for and protect a friendly democratic nation under assault.   A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows an overwhelming majority of Americans (74%) support establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, banning U.S. imports of Russian oil (80%), and imposing further penalties on the  Russian economy  (81%).  UKRAINE'S MILITARY DESPERATELY NEEDS MORE LETHAL AID AND CONGRESS MUST STEP UP As Russian atrocities in Ukraine pile up, Americans want Biden to get more aggressive. Efforts to pacify Vladimir Putin have come up short. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky told U.S. senators in recent days that the West’s sanctions should have been imposed earlier; perhaps the magnitude of the penalties would have caused Putin to reconsider.     Video Unfortunately, Biden dithered, instead warning Putin that he would become a ""pariah,"" as though that might stop him.  The president also foolishly announced that we would not commit troops to the fight and implied that a ""small incursion"" might not warrant serious punishment.  When numerous threats of impending penalties failed to stop the invasion, Biden said the sanctions were not meant as a deterrent; certainly, imposed after the fact, they did nothing to deter Putin.  History tells us that if we accede to Russia’s takeover of Ukraine, the aggression will not stop.    The president’s celebratory State of the Union address was premature. Yes, he joined with NATO to impose the harshest sanctions ever leveled against a large economy; what good has it done? In fact, Biden did not unite NATO; Putin united NATO.  History tells us that if we accede to Russia’s takeover of Ukraine, the aggression will not stop.  If President Obama had hit back hard when Putin attacked Crimea in 2015, perhaps Russia would not be invading Ukraine today. But Obama, warning that Putin would be ""isolated"" on the world stage, did little to punish Putin for that act of aggression.    Video If George W. Bush had sent military aid to Georgia in 2008 when Russia invaded that country, maybe he would not have been emboldened. Instead, Bush told Putin he would ""jeopardize"" his standing in the West.   Sound familiar?  Yes, pushing back against Putin’s insistent press to rebuild the Soviet Empire is risky. So is turning our back on a malevolent dictator who stops at nothing to resurrect his country’s former greatness.     Video Consider: Russia attacked Ukraine’s biggest nuclear power plant, and Putin has also raised his nuclear forces to high alert. These are the acts of a madman. A madman who knows the West is scared of conflict and unwilling to confront him.  Putin has warned that establishing a no-fly zone in Ukraine is tantamount to a declaration of war. But he also likens imposing sanctions to a declaration of war. In his mind, we are already at war.  The West cannot simply look the other way as a dangerous criminal destroys a democratic country of 44 million people.     Video And yes, China’s President Xi Jinping is watching. He is readying his own ""unification"" – the takeover of Taiwan – and if western nations are unable or unwilling to confront Putin, he will be encouraged.  What should Biden do?  ** Immediately sanction Russia’s oil and gas industry. Already exports of oil have dropped, thanks to nervous shippers and insurers. However, even with Russian oil being discounted by $15-$20 per barrel, it remains a lifeline for Putin. Cut the lifeline. At the very least, stop oil from Russia flowing into the U.S.    Video ** Follow German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ lead and get realistic about the security need for energy independence. Bring U.S. oil and gas producers to the White House and tell them you will speed permits, eliminate fees and increase acreage available to them to drill. Use our bounteous energy resources as a weapon, which they are.   ** Give a prime-time speech outlining your shift on energy policy, reviving Obama’s ""all-of the-above"" strategy. Explain this is a temporary but necessary hiatus in the ongoing transfer to green energy.      Video ** Declare a no-fly zone over western Ukraine, where there are not yet Russian troops, to ensure ongoing stepped-up delivery of weapons, including fighter planes and humanitarian supplies. Make it clear that NATO will not attack Russian planes unless they breach that airspace; any downing of Russian aircraft will be on Putin, not NATO.  ** Remind Americans that in 1994, under the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, the United States, Russia and others pledged to not invade Ukraine’s borders, in exchange for that country giving up its huge nuclear arsenal. Putin has violated that promise. While we did not commit to militarily defend Ukraine, we are morally obligated to do so.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER ** Launch an all-out effort – whatever it takes -- to tell the Russian people what is taking place in Ukraine.

   Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  is set to be named a recipient of the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award for his ""indomitable stance for freedom and democracy"" as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues for a twelfth day. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute is set to announce the award Monday for Zelenskyy's ""courageous fight against tyranny."" ""The world applauds President Zelenskyy and all that he stands for—democracy, individual liberty, freedom and hope,"" chairman of the foundation and institute board of trustees, Fred Ryan, said in a statement according to Axios, which first reported the expected award. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Ryan provided the news of the foundation's award to Zelenskyy by letter, which was delivered during a meeting with Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.  ""These are the values and principles that Ronald Reagan fought for all his life and what his foundation promotes today,"" Ryan said. ""President Zelenskyy’s devotion to the cause of freedom is truly a symbol of man’s highest aspiration. He deserves to receive the Reagan Freedom Award."" The award is considered the ""highest civilian honor"" bestowed by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute, and is given to those who have made ""monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide."" UKRAINIAN LEADERS HAVE 'CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT' PLAN IF ZELENSKYY IS KILLED: BLINKEN Zelenskyy was sworn in as the president of Ukraine on May 20, 2019, and has become the ""face of Ukraine's resistance against  Russian President Vladimir Putin's  invading forces,"" the Reagan Foundation said, adding that while he was a ""political novice with no military background, President Zelenskyy has earned the respect of Ukraine and those around the world by refusing to flee the capital, urging Ukrainians to resist, and crafting a successful communications strategy that has won over European leaders and citizens.""  Former President Reagan, in May 1992, gave the award to former General Secretary and President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.   Video On June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to deliver on international peace and progressive policies. His challenge was heard around the world during a speech that marked a turning point in the Cold War.  ""General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here, to this gate,"" Reagan said. ""Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" The award has also been given to then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the late Colin Powell; Yitzhak Rabin, former prime minister of Israel; former President of Poland Lech Walesa; Bob Hope, the ambassador of ""Goodwill""; former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; and former President George H.W. Bush, among others. A LOOK AT UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY'S ACTING CAREER BEFORE HE ENTERED POLITICS Ukrainian officials said last week that Zelenskyy has already evaded one assassination attempt that was intended to be carried out by a group of elite Chechen special forces. U.S. officials have reportedly urged Ukrainians not to allow senior officials to remain in the same place for long periods of time and to move to locations outside the nation’s capital, The New York Times reported, citing a person briefed on the conversations. Zelenskyy has remained in Kyiv during the invasion and dispelled rumors last week that he fled the country.  Zelenskyy, over the weekend, asked  Congress  for more lethal aid,  more planes, more sanctions, and to shut down Russian oil exports during a virtual video call with lawmakers as Washington weighs more aid to help Ukraine fight off the ongoing brutal Russian invasion. The meeting came as NATO rejected a Zelenskyy request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to provide air cover for the Ukrainian people. Zelenskyy slammed the decision, but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that having alliance planes over Ukrainian airspace could spark a new world war. UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IS ‘EVERY BIT A HERO AND A LEADER’: PRINCE CHARLES' COUSIN CHRISTINA OXENBERG Ukraine is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the Article 5 provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked all member countries will take action to assist. The Biden administration is requesting at least $10 billion in new money to  provide aid to Ukraine  amid Putin's war against the nation. The aid would go for additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Meanwhile, on Monday, in a video address to the Ukrainian people, Zelenskyy said they ""never wanted this war but it has been brought.""  ""We never dreamed of killing but we are forced to get the enemy away from our lives and our land,"" he said. ""We have to go through things that any other European people hasn't had to experience in the last 80 years.""  Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian people are ""deciding the future of the continent with our resistance.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Congress  is trying to do something about Ukraine. Only, it can’t do much. There are increasing calls — especially among  Republican  lawmakers — for NATO to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine. A war spilling over into Europe alarms many on Capitol Hill. That’s why Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., are now pushing for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Kinzinger was a pilot in the Air National Guard until recently.  Lawmakers aren’t confident that the current ""containment"" policy is working. This is all hypothetical. You might characterize the no-fly zone talk as ""infuse to defuse."" The push reflects a slow shift on Capitol Hill among lawmakers as they try to push their way into the conflict without getting the West bogged down in battle. It’s nibbling around the edges in order to keep a broader war from spreading. UKRAINE CONFLICT ‘HEIGHTENS THE RISK’ OF CHINESE AMERICAN WAR, PROFESSOR SAYS NATO  would undoubtedly administer any ""no-fly zone."" The United States would inevitably be a part of such an operation. Colleague Rich Edson notes that NATO just discussed the issue at a meeting in Brussels.  The Pentagon stressed that a no-fly zone would invite conflict between NATO and Russian aircraft. NATO leaders, including Secretary of State  Antony Blinken , have stressed the importance of defending NATO territory, which does not include Ukraine. ""We are not going to move into Ukraine. Neither on the ground or in the Ukrainian airspace,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send fighter planes into Ukraine and the airspace and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes."" Still, American lawmakers are trying to manage this fight from afar, floating ideas and suggestions. Even if they are rejected in Brussels.     
      Sunlight shines on the U.S. Capitol building on Capitol Hill in Washington.
       (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) Here’s the problem for the U.S. if it is involved in a hypothetical no-fly zone: The declaration of a no-fly zone isn’t self-executing. It entails enforcement. A no-fly zone is only successful when one side can maintain clear superiority in the air. That is not the case if NATO and the U.S. were to be involved with enforcing a no-fly zone over  Ukraine  and are up against the Russians. Enforcing a no-fly zone is an  offensive  action. Not a defensive one. To enforce a no-fly zone, one side must first bomb its adversary’s air defense systems, radar, planes on the ground, radio communications technology, et al. The side enforcing the no-fly zone must be ready to engage in air combat and face enemy fire. This crystallizes a key point in this conflict. The U.S. and NATO want to stay out of harm’s way. They don’t want to face war against Russia, a sophisticated military power. But, a no-fly zone essentially shifts America onto a war footing. It is impossible to be a little bit pregnant, as they say. But you can be a little bit at war.  Any involvement by the U.S. in a no-fly zone proposed by lawmakers is problematic constitutionally. A coalition of lawmakers on the left and the right would howl. They would argue that Congress must have a say in such a military commitment overseas. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the right to determine the use of U.S. forces overseas if they encounter hostilities. In other words, is bombing targets or engaging in hostilities overseas ""war?"" Or something else? This is the slippery slope. The U.S. and an international coalition enforced a no-fly zone for years in northern and southern Iraq between the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 war in Iraq. Congress approved a resolution for the Iraq war in the fall of 1990. But the congressional authorization for military operations in Iraq after liberating Kuwait between 1991 and 2003 were murky at best. NATO began patrolling a no-fly zone over Bosnia in the early 1990s during the civil war that broke out in the former Yugoslavia. NATO got involved due to crimes against civilians. NATO initiated Operation Deny Flight to prevent Bosnian Serbs from attacking Bosnian Muslims and Croats. NATO saw combat for the first time in its history when it shot down Serb aircraft over Banja Luka in 1994.  The Serbs infamously fired a shoulder-mounted missile that hit the F-16 piloted by U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O’Grady June 2, 1995. O’Grady was flying a sortie enforcing the no-fly zone from Aviano Air Base in Italy. O’Grady successfully ejected and hid in the dirt for days from Bosnian-Serb forces. He sent intermittent radio transmissions. A Marine mission then crossed into Bosnian Serb territory six days later, tracing O’Grady’s signal beacon. HUMANITARIAN NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE PROPOSED BY FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER After picking up O’Grady, the U.S. military helicopter lifted off but encountered fire from Serb forces, narrowly sidestepping catastrophe and triggering deeper U.S. involvement. NATO eventually unleashed a series of airstrikes against the Serbs in the summer of 1995. That ended the war in Bosnia. That is why Stoltenberg and others oppose a no-fly zone. Such a scenario could quickly devolve into Russians taking on Americans. So, lawmakers are pushing other approaches. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers now wants the U.S. to bar the importation of Russian oil. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is on board. ""I think there’s a moral obligation here,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. ""I don’t want U.S. dollars to be funding this carnage in Ukraine led by Putin.""     
      Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., leaves a Democratic luncheon at the U.S. Capitol.
       (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Of course, there’s concern that Russia will just find another customer for its oil. Perhaps China. And even though Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is confident the U.S. can ""backfill"" the oil with domestic production, gas prices here could still climb. Manchin has long fretted the impact of inflation. It’s one of the reasons Manchin killed the Democrats’ Build Back Better measure. But Manchin wasn’t worried about gas prices skyrocketing if the U.S. cut off Russian petrol. ""Inflation is a tax. This is war,"" said Manchin. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES Granted, this isn’t a war in which the U.S. is involved – yet. Still, Manchin believes Americans would be willing to pay more at the pump. ""I would gladly pay ten cents a gallon (more),"" said Manchin. So, lawmakers are searching for alternatives.     
      Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., waits to speak to reporters at the Capitol in Washington.
       (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) Sen. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., offered one option. ""Is there a Brutus in Russia?"" Graham tweeted. He followed up on Fox. ""If (Russian President  Vladimir Putin ) attacks a NATO nation, we’ll have World War III,"" said Graham. ""I’m hoping somebody will understand that he’s destroying Russia, and you need to take this guy out by any means possible.  William Shakespeare wrote about Brutus killing Julius Caesar.

Look at him in Hong Kong and Tibet in western China with the Uyghurs, this is a very tough guy. I think we need to prove that we’re prepared to defend Taiwan, not just talk about it. In addition, the insanity of the Biden Administration in allowing the Russians to be involved in negotiating with Iran at a time when we are trying to isolate Russia is going to lead to an insane deal in which the leading terrorist country in the world is given money by the U.S. in order to be able to pay for terrorism in the U.S. You have to wonder where are the Biden people psychologically, in reality? Second, why does Biden want to appeal to Venezuela, which is a communist dictatorship? To Saudi Arabia which is a monarchical dictatorship, but is against Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, etc. There is an anti-American pattern to this administration that is really weird.

""However, this is the first activity we have seen at the site since North Korea dismantled it in May 2018."" A Department of Defense spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Monday that it does not comment on ""matters of intelligence or commercial imagery analysis,"" but is aware of the threat posed by North Korea.  ""We have been very clear on the threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) missile programs, and our commitment to the defense of the ROK, Japan, and the U.S. homeland, and our commitment to uphold regional peace and stability,"" the DoD spokesperson said.

I believe the Pentagon when they say they are upping their game and are trying to get all in here with everything and that is critical. For the life of me, I don't know why we haven't given them anti-ship missiles. They've been asking for it from the beginning. There seems to be some reluctance there. If it's a training issue, we can probably use our imagination and figure out how we can get some Ukrainians trained on this covertly so they can deliver those weapons as amphibious ships that are approaching Odesa, with huge amount of naval infantry on board; they are vulnerable, certainly to anti-ship missiles. This is going to be a pacing item because as the Ukrainians are dealing with the advance of the Russians installing them, obviously the war is going into a very protracted phase, which puts a premium on the weapons they need to continue to have success against the Russians.

She explained that the last straw before quitting RT wasn’t any sort of on-air propaganda, but rather an Instagram message from her colleague who wrote, ""If you are now ashamed of being Russian, don’t worry, you are not Russian,"" as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine intensified.  ""I was really disturbed by that tone and level of support,"" Baronova said, noting that she publicly responded to her now-former coworker’s message.  ""If I chose to be with Russia, this does not mean that I should walk in a totalitarian system, be silent or, for example, rejoice that the regime, which I do not want for my country, is being exported somewhere else,"" Baronova wrote. ""And this regime will finally turn our life into one endless hell. What's there. Already turned."" Baronova then stepped down from the state-run network.  ""That was the moment I decided, ‘OK, that’s it,’"" she said.   PUTIN IS ‘TRYING BUT FAILING’ TO CONTROL UKRAINE INVASION NARRATIVE BY SHUTTING DOWN NON-STATE MEDIA Baronova said she hasn’t garnered much support from fellow Russians since leaving RT and is seen as an opposition activist. But this isn’t the first time Baronova found herself in the public eye for opposing Putin’s regime.  She was featured in a  2012 New York Times piece  headlined, ""A Face of the Russian Protest Movement,"" that detailed the time she was charged with inciting a riot while protesting Putin winning a third term. In 2014,  Rolling Stone  said she was ""for a short while, one of the most visible protesters in Moscow,"" in a piece that detailed anti-Putin activism led by the punk band Pussy Riot.  Her life was upended after the arrest and she eventually went to work for Dozhd, Russia’s top independent TV channel which is also known as TV Rain and famously critical of Putin.  Baronova, who was by then a single mother, jumped ship to RT in 2019, irking fellow Putin oppositionists who felt she was abandoning the movement by joining state-run media.  ""People felt betrayed when I decided to join RT,"" she said. ""But I decided on purpose in order to have a reasonable conversation with people who are in power right now in Russia."" Last week, Russian authorities accused TV Rain of peddling ""false information regarding the actions of Russian military personnel as part of a special operation"" in Ukrainec, and Baronova’s prior network was promptly forced off the air as Putin purged non-state media.

Baronova said she also spent much of her time at RT working on a fundraiser for mothers of children with cerebral palsy, and she was largely kept out of conversations regarding which Kremlin talking points would be spouted by the outlet despite her managing editor title.  Roughly three years after joining the state-run news organization with hopes of forcing change, the activist-turned-journalist had seen enough after Putin’s ruthless attack on Ukraine that was supported by many of her now-former RT colleagues.  ""I have nothing else to talk about with them,"" she said. ""Our own government is bombing our relatives, our friends.""

Putin has claimed he wants to purge Ukraine of fascism; such messages, experts have told Fox News Digital,  are appealing in Russia  since loathing for the defeated Nazi Germany regime runs deep.

Putin has cracked down on non-state news since the invasion of Ukraine began, with social media platforms and independent news operations forced to shut down for refusing to parrot propaganda. Some locals don’t mind that Putin has silenced non-state media and a Moscow taxi driver even told Baronova the now-shuttered TV Rain was filled with ""traitors"" who opposed the Kremlin.   ""A lot of people have these kind of sentiments,"" she said.

How can they be saying that Russia is fighting with Hitler collaborators in Ukraine when Hitler died 80 years ago? But they really have these kinds of conversations,"" Baronova said, noting that some Russians have begun to open their eyes because of sanctions and American companies pulling out of the nation.  ""People were in favor on [the] first day of invasion. Now they are less convinced and much more skeptical because they understand now that they are going to lose their jobs, they are going to lose their cars, their iPhones, their everything,"" she said. ""So, let’s see what that are going to say in a month ... The whole world is in a bad position.""

Former DIA Intelligence Officer Matthew Shoemaker and Fox News contributor Judy Miller break down the 'delicate diplomatic game.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy on Monday again pleaded for the international community to create a  no-fly zone  over Ukraine and ""boycotts"" of Russian oil as Russia continues its invasion of the country for a twelfth day. In a statement Monday, Zelenskyy addressed  Ukrainians  as ""peaceful people,"" saying they ""never wanted this war but it has been brought."" UKRAINE URGES WORLD TO 'STEP UP,' IMPOSE NO-FLY ZONE, WHILE US LAWMAKERS WARN THIS WOULD MEAN 'WORLD WAR III' ""We’ve never dreamed of killing, but we are forced to get the enemy away from our lives and our land,"" he said, adding that the Ukrainian people have to ""go through the things that any other European people hasn’t had to experience in the last 80 years."" ""And it’s exactly on our land that it’s been decided whether somebody else in Europe will become the victim of the same aggression,"" he said. ""I tell this to European leaders and I hear that they agree."" Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ""deciding the future of the continent with our resistance."" ""If the invasion continues and Russia does not change its plans, then the new sanctions package is needed,"" Zelenskyy said. ""New sanctions steps against the war, for the sake of peace."" Zelenskyy called for ""boycotts of Russian exports, namely refusal from oil and oil products from Russia."" ""It may be called embargo, but it also simply may be called a moral when you refuse to give money to a terrorist,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that there should also be a boycott of imports into Russia, saying if Moscow doesn’t want to ""follow civilized rules, then they should also not be getting any goods or services from civilization.""    Video ""Let the war feed them,"" Zelenskyy said, urging the international community to ""act even with bigger resolution."" Zelenskyy’s call to boycott Russian oil imports comes as the Biden administration and members of Congress have said it may be time for a ban on Russian imports. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said that the administration is speaking with partners and allies ""to look, in a coordinated way, at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil, while making sure there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets."" Blinken said it is a ""very active discussion."" US, POLAND IN TALKS TO HELP UKRAINE ACQUIRE WARPLANES Republicans and moderate Democrats alike are calling for the ramping up of American energy production, with GOP lawmakers criticizing the Biden administration for shutting down U.S. oil and gas pipelines. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy warned that Ukrainians have to ""fight against inhuman force, which is trying to destroy humanity itself."" ""The success of the Ukrainian army, will of the Ukranian people, principles of international sanctions—this is the path to peace,"" he said, calling Russia’s attacks in residential neighborhoods ""terror,"" but warning that they will ""get punishment."" ""Our Armed Forces know how to do it. The enemy is tired and demoralized. They’ve come to our land searching here for something that has never been here - cowardice, consent to betrayal,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Any normal person cannot look without fear at the burnt houses, it’s clear, at the destroyed multi storied residential buildings; regular cars destroyed by rockets, grenade launchers, mortar launchers against people."" ""The feeling is that it’s happening in another country but it’s happening in our country, namely in our country that has always wanted peace more than anything,"" he said. Calling again for a no-fly zone, Zelenskyy pleaded with western allies: ""How many deaths and losses are still needed to secure the sky over Ukraine?"" ""What is the difference between peaceful people in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv and those in Hamburg and Vienna? We are awaiting the decision, clearing of the sky, either by the forces that you have or you give us the fighter planes of anti-aircraft defense that you have and that will provide the needed strength to us,"" he said. Zelenskyy said a no-fly zone is ""not just for Ukraine but for yourselves, too, in order to prove that humanity will win as fast as it can.""   Video Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian government is ""already working on how to restore our country after the victory, how to provide strength to the country while we are fighting."" Zelenskyy, on Sunday, also called for a no-fly zone, in a video message posted to Twitter bearing subtitles in English that stated: ""We repeat everyday: ‘Close the sky over Ukraine!’"" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova espoused the same message on ""Fox News Sunday,"" in response to the Biden administration stating that it would not be imposing a no-fly zone. Markarova offered a reminder that Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked, and that if this could happen to Ukraine, it could happen to others. ""So if this situation, you know, happened to Ukraine, who is safe? What democracy can feel safe right now?"" Markarova wondered. ""So, I think, you know, the events of the past 11 days clearly shows that we have to act together and that Russia can attack anyone being totally unprovoked like they did with Ukraine. So it's time for all of us to step up."" Ukraine’s calls for a no-fly zone come as the Biden administration and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have made clear they are firmly against such a move. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., explained why a no-fly zone is more complicated and dangerous than people may realize. ""It’s not just some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by. It’s the willingness to shoot down the aircraft of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World War III,"" Rubio told ABC's ""This Week."" On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Rubio's Democratic and Republican colleagues agreed, pointing out why a no-fly zone would not be in the best interest of the U.S., even if it is understandable for Ukraine to want one. ""I think we need to be clear that we are not going to go to war with Russia, that would be the beginning of WWIII, and it would drag all of Europe into a much broader war,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said. ""If I were President Zelenskyy, I would be asking for a no-fly zone. The problem is, there is no such thing as a no-fly zone over Ukraine,"" Murphy said. ""If the United States put planes in the air, we would immediately be shooting at Russian planes. They would be shooting at us. We would be at war.""   Video Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, also recognized that Zelenskyy was doing the right thing for his country to ask for a no-fly zone, but making clear that ""we do not want to engage directly with Russians."" ""But what we can do,"" Ernst said, ""is provide all the defensive mechanisms for President Zelenskyy and his armed services to provide their own protected airspace."" Ernst said this begins ""with providing air platforms to President Zelenskyy, making sure that those pilots are able to protect their own airspace."" Last week, the Biden administration ruled out setting up a no-fly zone for Russian aircraft over Ukraine, with senior defense officials saying enacting one would put the United States ""in the fight""--as President Biden has maintained that U.S. military will not fight in Ukraine. A no-fly zone is ""just not going to happen,"" the official added. ZELENSKYY WINS RONALD REAGAN FREEDOM AWARD Biden, last week, authorized an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Germany, and said the U.S. ""will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" ""Let me say it again — our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East."" ""There is no doubt, no doubt, that the United States and every NATO ally will meet our Article V commitments, which says, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" Biden said.   Video Last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened preparedness. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy, asked  Congress  for more lethal aid, more planes, more sanctions, and to shut down Russian oil exports during a virtual video call with lawmakers as Washington weighs more aid to help Ukraine fight off the ongoing brutal  Russian invasion .  The meeting came as NATO also rejected a Zelenskyy request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to provide air cover for the Ukrainian people. Zelenskyy slammed the decision, but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that having alliance planes over Ukrainian airspace could spark a new world war. UKRAINIAN LEADERS HAVE 'CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT' PLAN IF ZELENSKYY IS KILLED: BLINKEN Ukraine is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked all member countries will take action to assist. The Biden administration is requesting at least $10 billion in new money to provide aid to Ukraine amid Putin's war against the nation. The aid would go for additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian government is creating a ""special aid package"" for businesses and employees in Ukraine, and those who were recruited into the Armed Forces and other defense organizations. The package would free those individuals of ""paying the tax for land and lease payments for land of state communal property at all of the territories where military action is going on.""  ""These conditions will last throughout the martial law time and as a minimum for a year after its end,"" Zelenskyy said, noting this is ""just the first part of the large aid package of governmental assistance.""  Fox News' Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report.     ",2022-03

   Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday called out Russian forces for their reported attacks of ""agreed upon humanitarian corridors,"" urging Russia to ""stop these attacks immediately,"" as the Biden administration continues its ongoing review of whether Russian aggression against civilians has reached the  level of war crimes. During a joint press conference with Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs, Blinken slammed Russia's ongoing ""unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" which began 12 days ago. Since then, Blinken said, ""more than 1.5 million people, mostly women and children, have had to flee Ukraine, flee their homes."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""In the last several days, more strikes have killed and wounded civilians as they try to leave the cities that are being surrounded by Russian forces,"" Blinken said, pointing to the ""women and children, the elderly, wounded civilians, people with disabilities"" trying to ""escape cities where there’s no heat, no electricity, relentless bombardment, and where they’re running out of food and medicine."" ""And there continue to be reports of  attacks by Russian forces  on agreed upon humanitarian corridors,"" Blinken said, likening the invasion to the ""horrific siege of Leningrad during World War II.""

       (Olivier Douliery, Pool Photo via AP) ""The world is saying to Russia, stop these attacks immediately,"" Blinken said. ""Let the food and medicine, let the people out safely and end this war of choice against Ukraine.""  Blinken said that the United States, allies, and partners ""will continue to  stand with Ukraine. "" ""We’re searching our security systems to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself,"" he said, adding that the Biden administration is ""increasing humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people, both those still inside Ukraine, and those who have had to flee.""  Blinken said the U.S. is also ""raising the costs on the Kremlin and all the aid and enablement for continuing this war.""  Blinken said the U.S. is ""bolstering"" its ""shared defense"" with NATO.

""Our commitment to Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all, is ironclad,"" he added. Blinken said that his ""message on behalf of the United States"" to the people of ""all of the Baltics"" is that the United States ""is more committed than ever to standing with you, as our democracies rise to the challenge at this moment."" Blinken's comments about attacks on civilians, however, come as the Biden administration has sent mixed messages about whether Russia has committed war crimes during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. ""We are collecting evidence of possible war crimes, human rights abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law. We support accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions where appropriate,"" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council told Fox News Monday. ""We helped pass a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry to investigate possible human rights violations by Russia and hold them accountable.""  The spokesperson said that the U.S. and 44 other countries ""have established an expert mission through the OSCE to investigate possible violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law by Russia.""  ""We will support accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions where appropriate,"" the NSC spokesperson told Fox News.  Officials told Fox News that the evidence the U.S. collects as part of that inquiry will be shared with allies and partners and with investigations underway, including the UN Human Rights Council and OSCE Expert Mission.  BIDEN ADMIN SENDS MIXED MESSAGES ON ALLEGED RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES Last week, when asked about whether Russia was committing war crimes, President  Biden said he and his  administration  were monitoring the situation, but that it was too soon to make a determination. On Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked whether the strike on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is located about 350 miles southeast of Kyiv, would constitute a war crime to the U.S. government, but responded that there were still internal investigations underway. ""We have an internal review that's been ongoing prior to last night to collect evidence and data of the targeting of civilians, of the reported use of horrific weapons of war on the ground in Ukraine,"" Psaki said.   Video ""That's an ongoing process. We have not made conclusions. It's a legal review and a process that goes through the administration."" The U.S. Embassy to Ukraine, however, said Friday morning that the Russians had committed a war crime.  ""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,"" the embassy tweeted.  Russian forces put staff at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant under their command and cut off their ability to communicate with Ukraine’s nuclear regulator, according to the United Nation’s International Atomic Energy Agency. The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant was originally seized by Russian troops on Friday after an adjacent five-story training facility was set on fire by a Russian projectile.  ""Ukraine reports that any action of plant management – including measures related to the technical operation of the six reactor units – requires prior approval by the Russian commander,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday.  ""In a second serious development, Ukraine has reported that the Russian forces at the site have switched off some mobile networks and the internet so that reliable information from the site cannot be obtained through the normal channels of communication.""

       (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant via AP) Phone lines, emails, and fax were no longer functioning on Sunday, and mobile phone communications were poor, Ukraine's nuclear regulator told the UN agency.  The IAEA accused Russia of violating key safety guidelines governing nuclear plants, including that ""operating staff must be able to fulfill their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure,"" and that there must be ""reliable communications with the regulator and others."" Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy  accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"" after the attack.  ""Russian propaganda had warned in the past to cover the world in nuclear ash,"" Zelenskyy said, according to a translation of his remarks. ""Now this isn’t just a warning, this is real."" RUSSIANS SEIZE CONTROL OF STAFF AT EUROPE'S LARGEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN UKRAINE, CUT OFF COMMUNICATIONS The UN's nuclear watchdog also expressed concern about the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces on the first day of their invasion. More than 200 technical personnel and guards at Chernobyl have not rotated since Feb. 23, the IAEA said.  Hundreds of civilians have been killed  since Russian forces started bombing populated areas across Ukraine, according to numerous reports. At least one cluster munition strike reportedly hit a hospital, killing four and injuring 10.  The first Geneva Convention in 1864 outlawed assaults on medical personnel on the battlefield.   Video ""We cannot confirm the existence of the use of cluster munitions inside Ukraine, nor can we confirm the use or existence of thermobaric weapons inside Ukraine. We've seen reports of them mobilizing their reserves,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week. ""We cannot confirm those reports. So rather than speculating about what that might indicate, I would just tell you that we've seen them, but we can't confirm those reports."" BIDEN SAYS RUSSIA TARGETING CIVILIAN AREAS, US DOING 'EVERYTHING WE CAN' TO HELP ZELENSKYY Cluster munitions are explosives that contain smaller bombs.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The Biden administration is considering a possible ban of  oil imports  from Russia to the United States, but ""no decision has been made at this time,"" an administration official told Fox News. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the administration is speaking with partners and allies ""to look, in a coordinated way, at the prospect of banning the import of  Russian oil,  while making sure there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES An administration official told Fox News Monday, though, that discussions are ongoing. ""We have been very clear that we’re considering a possible U.S. oil import ban,"" the official told Fox News. ""No decision has been made at this time."" The official said that Russia is the third-largest producer of oil in the world, and said that ""impact to U.S. oil imports would be minimal compared to allies and partners.""  Russian oil exports account for about one third of Europe’s oil imports, however, for the United States, Russian exports are just under 10% of U.S. overall imports. ""So we recognize the United States has a different set of capacities and capabilities of mitigating the impact than other allies and partners,"" the official told Fox News. ""When we say we are engaging with allies and partners on this, it’s about working with a range of countries around the world—both energy producers and those with reserves of oil supply—on addressing impact of energy price pressures,"" the official added. The comments came after Reuters, on Monday, reported that the Biden administration could be considering a ban on Russian oil imports into the U.S. without its allies in Europe doing the same. ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, 'BOYCOTTS' OF RUSSIAN OIL ON DAY 12 OF INVASION The comments also come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for ""boycotts"" of Russian oil as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine for a twelfth day. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ""deciding the future of the continent with our resistance."" ""If the invasion continues and Russia does not change its plans, then the new sanctions package is needed,"" Zelenskyy said. ""New sanctions steps against the war, for the sake of peace."" Zelenskyy called for ""boycotts of Russian exports, namely refusal from oil and oil products from Russia.""   Video ""It may be called embargo, but it also simply may be called a moral when you refuse to give money to a terrorist,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that there should also be a boycott of imports into Russia, saying if Moscow doesn’t want to ""follow civilized rules, then they should also not be getting any goods or services from civilization.""  But the calls to boycott Russian oil imports are not only coming from Zelenskyy—both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have also said it may be time for a ban on Russian imports. UKRAINE URGES WORLD TO 'STEP UP,' IMPOSE NO-FLY ZONE, WHILE US LAWMAKERS WARN THIS WOULD MEAN 'WORLD WAR III' Republicans and moderate Democrats alike are calling for the ramping up of American energy production, with GOP lawmakers criticizing the Biden administration for shutting down U.S. oil and gas pipelines. As the war in Ukraine rages on, Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crises, with the national gas price average reaching $4 per gallon.  Biden spent much of last year citing the need to move away from fossil fuels because climate change was the ""greatest threat"" to the country, and one of his first acts was to shut down the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Now, critics are slamming him by pointing to current events as evidence that energy independence is essential. Zelenskyy, on Monday, also called, again, for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, pleading with western allies: """"How many deaths and losses are still needed to secure the sky over Ukraine?"" ""What is the difference between peaceful people in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv and those in Hamburg and Vienna? We are awaiting the decision, clearing of the sky, either by the forces that you have or you give us the fighter planes of anti-aircraft defense that you have and that will provide the needed strength to us,"" he said. Zelenskyy said a no-fly zone is ""not just for Ukraine but for yourselves, too, in order to prove that humanity will win as fast as it can."" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova espoused the same message on ""Fox News Sunday,"" in response to the Biden administration stating that it would not be imposing a no-fly zone. Markarova offered a reminder that Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked, and that if this could happen to Ukraine, it could happen to others.   Video ""So if this situation, you know, happened to Ukraine, who is safe? What democracy can feel safe right now?"" Markarova wondered. ""So, I think, you know, the events of the past 11 days clearly shows that we have to act together and that Russia can attack anyone being totally unprovoked like they did with Ukraine. So it's time for all of us to step up."" BIDEN MAY TRAVEL TO SAUDI ARABIA IN QUEST FOR OIL, REPORT SAYS, AS RUSSIA BAN REMAINS POSSIBILITY Ukraine’s calls for a no-fly zone come as the Biden administration and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have made clear they are firmly against such a move. Last week, the Biden administration ruled out setting up a no-fly zone for Russian aircraft over Ukraine, with senior defense officials saying enacting one would put the United States ""in the fight""--as President Biden has maintained that U.S. military will not fight in Ukraine. A no-fly zone is ""just not going to happen,"" the official added. Biden, last week, authorized an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Germany, and said the U.S. ""will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" ""Let me say it again — our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East."" ""There is no doubt, no doubt, that the United States and every NATO ally will meet our Article V commitments, which says, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" Biden said. Last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened preparedness. GAS PRICES ABOVE $4 PER GALLON AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IMPACTS SUPPLY, DISRUPTING GLOBAL MARKET Over the weekend, Zelenskyy asked  Congress  for more lethal aid, more planes, more sanctions, and to shut down Russian oil exports during a virtual video call with lawmakers as Washington weighs more aid to help Ukraine fight off the ongoing brutal  Russian invasion .  The meeting came as NATO also rejected a Zelenskyy request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to provide air cover for the Ukrainian people. Zelenskyy slammed the decision, but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that having alliance planes over Ukrainian airspace could spark a new world war. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ukraine is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked all member countries will take action to assist. The Biden administration is requesting at least $10 billion in new money to provide aid to Ukraine amid Putin's war against the nation. The aid would go for additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Former DIA Intelligence Officer Matthew Shoemaker and Fox News contributor Judy Miller weigh in on day 12 of the conflict. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The gut-wrenching scenes from  Ukraine  have moved millions around the world to denounce the Russian invasion and support Ukrainian independence.  For some, however, it is a literal call to duty. Thousands of former soldiers have traveled to Ukraine to defend its people. The numbers have clearly unnerved the Russians who have launched a global campaign to warn volunteers that they will be treated as mercenaries, not legitimate prisoners of war if captured. ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, ‘BOYCOTTS’ OF RUSSIAN OIL     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to representatives of the flight crew of Russian airlines as he visits to Aeroflot Aviation School outside Moscow, Russia, Saturday, March 5, 2022.
       (Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) Among the large number of such volunteers drawn to Ukraine’s defense are many Americans. They are in a modern version of the Lincoln Brigade that fought against fascism in Spain before World War II. The similarities to the Spanish Civil War are striking with the fascists controlling the skies, fielding advanced weaponry, and engaging in war crimes. Back then, Russia supported the Republican forces against fascism. Now, however, Russia is declaring that foreign volunteers are not considered covered ""combatants"" under the Geneva Conventions. That is not true. Russian embassies are putting out statements telling men not to join the fight at the risk of being classified ""mercenaries."" The Russians are warning that the ""best case scenario"" is that foreign volunteers will be tried and punished as criminals, including the risk of executions.   Video Of course, Russia has little credibility on any interpretation of international law today. There is growing evidence of possible war crimes by Russia, including attacking civilian areas with indiscriminate weapons and using prohibited weapons. Moreover, Russia is using mercenaries like the infamous Wagner group. Putting aside the hypocrisy, the Russian government is legally wrong. Under the Geneva Conventions, ""the best case scenario"" is not ""detention and prosecution."" The Ukrainian president and government has officially called on international volunteers to join the Ukrainian military. They are a part of the Ukrainian defense forces and given Ukrainian training, uniforms, and insignia. The Russian position is akin to saying that the French Foreign Legion would be treated as mercenaries because it includes non-French volunteers. The Legion famously opens its ranks to ""recruits from all over the world."" Likewise, the estimated 16,000 foreign fighters are being organized under the ""Ukrainian Foreign Legion"" and requires a commitment of a year or longer of service.   Video The Geneva Conventions While there are areas of ambiguity over private contractors and other participants in conflicts, the current definitions of covered combatants clearly and unambiguously reject the Russian position.   Article 4(A)(1) includes ""Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps performing part of such armed forces."" Thus, both militias and volunteer corps are included. Article 4(A)(2) also makes clear that ""Militias and members of other volunteer corps … belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory"" enjoy combatant status and protections. Under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols, there is a division drawn between combatants and civilians. The later term can include unlawful combatants, spies, and mercenaries.   Video Moreover, Article 45 addressed the ""Protection of persons who have taken part in hostilities"" and affirms that every combatant who is captured shall be presumed to be a prisoner of war. Accordingly, if a foreign fighter is captured ""he shall continue to have such status and, therefore, to be protected by the Third Convention and this Protocol until such time as his status has been determined by a competent tribunal."" Conversely, mercenaries under Protocol I are defined as ""foreign combatants recruited to fight in one specific conflict and motivated by the desire for private gain in an amount in excess of the payment to the armed forces of the recruiting state."" That is not the case in Ukraine. History and Hypocrisy Ironically, the Russians have long embraced such international volunteers in combat operations. One of the largest such efforts was the Soviet Volunteer Group that went, with government support, to China to fight in the Second Sino-Japanese War between 1937 and 1941. These soldiers wore civilian clothes and traveled to China to become part of their military. That included hundreds of pilots and planes. The Russians also were foreign combatants in the Spanish Civil War. They were considered particularly key to the defense of Madrid against the fascists, including German forces. That included a force of T-26 tanks under the famed Captain Paul ""Greize"" Arman and Brigadier Dmitriy ""Pablo"" Pavlov. It also included dozens of Soviet I-15 fighters Tupolev ANT-40 bombers. Under the current interpretation of Russia, all of these men (called Soviet heroes) would now be treated as criminal mercenaries.   Video Future Enforcement Requires Immediate Clarity If Russia carries through on its interpretation of the Geneva Conventions to exclude foreign members of the Ukrainian defense force, it would be in flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions. One could say that this hardly matters when the Russians are shattering international legal principles and committing atrocities in the invasion. However, the violation of the Geneva Conventions exposes military commanders to possible international charges and sanctions. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (or ""the Tokyo Trial"") involved the prosecution of officials responsible for the abuse of POWs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Article 86(2) of Protocol I was written in light of the World War II cases. It imposes criminal liability on the commander if he knew or should have known that a subordinate was going to commit breaches of the conventions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The world legal community must speak with one voice in rejecting the interpretation put forward by Russia on the Geneva Conventions so there is no question about the knowledge of Russian commanders in committing such violations. When this war ends, there will hopefully be an accounting for those responsible. However, we must make that clear and unambiguous record now if we are going to later vindicate the rights of the victims of this invasion. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY  ",2022-03

The  talks  have been mired in uncertainty after Russia made last-minute demands that assure guarantees that the sanctions it faces over its invasion of Ukraine will not hurt trade with Iran.  The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) set limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for a significant rollback of international sanctions. The  Trump  administration pulled the U.S. out of the deal amid concerns that the agreement did not do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions -- including the sunset clauses on restrictions. Iran pulled out of the deal after the Trump administration imposed sanctions.  In the video, Ulyanov praised the Chinese over their role in the negotiations and said they worked well with Russia during the talks.  ""I am absolutely sincere in this regard when I say that Iran got much more than it could expect,"" he said.

McFarland Steve Forbes Stephen Moore,2022-03-07 13:11:00,"  close     Video   Newt Gingrich: Biden is ‘literally paying’ Russia’s bill to fight Ukraine   The former speaker of the House discusses President Biden, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and defunding the police. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Over the last two decades, American innovations led to unprecedented breakthroughs across all energy sectors, including renewables and traditional forms of energy. And for a brief recent period of time these gains helped to secure a monumental national achievement:  U.S. energy independence .  Sadly, in an even briefer period of time we quickly lost it due to policy decisions based on  leftist Green New Deal  political agendas embraced early on by the Biden administration.     Video As a result, Americans are paying skyrocketing costs for energy, food and other daily staples. Domestic prices will be further exacerbated by the new security threats and global instability arising from Russia’s  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine .   END UKRAINE SLAUGHTER AND STAND UP TO RUSSIA, AMERICANS TELL BIDEN IN NEW POLL All told, it is now abundantly clear the U.S. is in immediate need of a systemic reset of its energy policies.   Yet, it was evident from President Biden’s State of the Union address that his administration is set to double down on the same misguided policies that led to the loss of our energy independence, naively sticking to an almost exclusive focus on renewable energies at the expense of America’s vast arsenal of more conventional energy assets. Even more bizarre was former Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent tone-deaf commentary over the potential impact of battlefield emissions and concerns over whether war in Ukraine might distract Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attention from fighting climate change.    Video Do today’s liberal political leaders in Washington really expect our global allies, adversaries and competitors to take the U.S. seriously with such nonsense?   The world is not right at present. Accordingly, our clear objective here at home should be to quickly reestablish and permanently maintain U.S. energy independence. Not as a loosely held goal subject to varying political agendas, but as defined and permanent economic and national security imperatives. And we must do so by leveraging ALL U.S. energy resources.   Even European nations have now realized how blind allegiance to politically favored renewables and reliance on foreign energy sources threaten their economies and sovereignty, and they are changing course accordingly.     If the right public policy choices are made, U.S. energy independence can be reestablished in short order.    Not dissimilar from Operation Warp Speed, which mobilized U.S. innovators, manufacturers and other front-line industries to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 in record time, we must now unshackle our full array of energy resources and technologies to meet today’s clear and present dangers.  Looking abroad, we must recognize that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been enabled by two primary catalysts: unnecessarily high global energy prices and Europe’s reliance on Russian energy exports. Sadly, the Biden administration’s ""keystoning"" of critical domestic energy investments, punitive tax and regulatory policies, and the waiving off of Russian sanctions that helped to drive oil up over $100 per barrel have given Putin predictable leverage and additional means to generate billions to finance his military ambitions.         Video To address these challenges, there are four overarching objectives the U.S. needs to pursue.    First, we must immediately leverage America’s vast and diverse array of resources and technologies across the  entire  energy spectrum, including all types of renewable and traditional assets. To do so, we must quickly clear the decks of unnecessary legislative, regulatory and legal roadblocks impacting domestic production and global supplies.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Second, U.S. energy policy can no longer be subject to the political seesaw of whichever political party holds majority power at any particular time. This includes rampant regulatory and legal overreach based on political preferences. Doing so has led to an unstable and contradictory environment for critical public and private investments, resulting in unsustainable price shocks for American businesses, families and consumers. We must therefore apply realistic cost-benefit analysis to all current and future energy policies.     Video Third, technological viability assessments and national security threats must be fully evaluated and addressed within all government energy programs and policies. For example, much emphasis has been placed on electrifying large portions of our nation’s transportation system, while ignoring that the U.S. is currently dependent on raw materials from countries such as China. Meanwhile, federal and state politicians continue to set costly emissions requirements and price-spiraling fuel standards that are questionable in terms of environmental benefits or knowingly impossible to achieve.   Fourth, in the coming days and months we must make available cheap, clean and affordable energy to our European and Asian allies to deny Putin and other rogue actors the wherewithal to threaten or hold allied nations hostage over energy supplies. We must also help support our allies in diversifying their own energy resources and infrastructure to ensure their long-term safety and sovereignty.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If the right public policy choices are made at the federal, state and local levels, U.S. energy independence can be reestablished in short order. This will require that we and other nations jettison many of the current domestic regulatory and political obstacles that impede our ability to produce and provide critical energy supplies in timely, cost-effective and safe manners.   Ultimately, this approach – call it  Operation Energy Independence  – if embraced will lower energy costs and drive down inflation for all Americans while advancing greater peace and prosperity throughout the world.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KT McFARLAND CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY STEVE FORBES CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY STEPHEN MOORE     K.T.

   President  Biden’s  courting of Venezuelan oil in an attempt to end reliance on Russian imports and assuage skyrocketing gas prices at home could risk whitewashing the alleged ""crimes against humanity"" committed by the Venezuelan government and its closeness with  Russia .  Several senior Biden administration officials from the White House and State Department traveled to Venezuela on Saturday to meet with the government of Nicolás Maduro and discuss the possibility of easing sanctions on oil exports from the Latin American country as U.S. gas prices soared past levels not seen since 2008. BIDEN ADMIN COURTS VENEZUELA AS RUSSIAN ECONOMY TAKES HIT FROM SANCTIONS: REPORT White House  press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the trip Monday, saying officials traveled to  Venezuela  to discuss ""a range of issues, including certainly energy, energy security, but also to discuss the health and welfare of detained U.S. citizens.""     
      U.S. President Joe Biden meets with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö in the Oval Office of the White House March 4, 2022 in Washington, D.C.
       The rare meetings came as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine less than two weeks ago accelerated already skyrocketing fuel prices in the U.S. Last week, Venezuela and regional Russian allies Cuba and Nicaragua abstained from a vote condemning Russia for the invasion. Russia — along with China and Iran — came to  Venezuela’s  financial aid in 2019 after the Trump administration cut diplomatic ties with the Latin American country and sanctioned its oil exports to the U.S. amid Western accusations of an illegitimate election. The Trump White House recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the real president after Maduro was accused of election fraud. Maduro is also accused of a host of human rights abuses, including murders, torture and arbitrary detentions. In November, the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into allegations of ""crimes against humanity"" by the Maduro regime.

""If you’re doing business with the friends of Russia, you’re helping out Russians. It’s that simple,"" he said. ""Now you have an energy crisis, and your only way to resolve that is to do business with some of the most unsavory countries on Planet Earth who are the biggest human rights abusers."" ""They would rather buy oil from our adversaries who will actually use that money to attack American interests than pump oil and gas here, which would actually put more money in the American economy and actually make us more energy independent,"" he said. Psaki was pressed by one reporter Monday on whether it’s ""worth doing business"" with a ""despot"" like Maduro. ""I think that's leaping several stages ahead in any process,"" Psaki fired back. ""There was a discussion that was had by members of the administration over the course of the last several days. Those discussions are also ongoing, and part of our focus is also on the health and welfare of detained U.S. citizens.""     
      White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Friday, March 4, 2022.
       ""So at this point in time, I don't have anything to predict,"" she added. ""It's ongoing. I just don't have anything to convey at this point."" When asked by another reporter whether the U.S. was working on a deal to get detained Americans freed from Venezuela in exchange for lifting sanctions on oil exports, Psaki indicated that was not the case. ""There are different channels,"" she said. ""And obviously we're going to continue to do everything we can to bring anyone who is detained in Venezuela or any other part of the world home, but they happen through different tracks. They're all a part of the conversation with Venezuela writ large, but not at the same time."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carafano told Fox News Digital the strategy ""doesn't make any sense."" ""The problem is, when you buy oil from Venezuela, essentially what you're doing is you're putting dollars in to prop up the economy and more entrench the Maduro regime,"" he said. ""And at the same time, the only reason why this regime is existing at all, is on life support, is because of support from the Chinese, the Russians and the Cubans. So you have really the most detestable regime in Latin America that’s basically subsisting on these external actors."" Fox News’ Brie Stimson contributed reporting.  ",2022-03

Security Council meeting on the attack, and Monday in London, Johnson seemed to be leading the way as he stood alongside the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and Canada’s Justin Trudeau to rally international support for Ukraine.   RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A ‘VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD’  During his press conference Johnson announced that so far, the U.K. had given around $500,000 of aid to Ukraine and said the moment had come for ""Ukraine’s friends to create a coalition of humanitarian, economic and defensive military support to ensure that Putin fails.""

       (Jeff Mitchell /Pool Photo via AP) Speaking as if he had taken it upon himself to lead a type of coalition of the willing, Johnson noted that Putin ""has underestimated the unity of the West. And we will continue to strengthen that unity in the days ahead to ensure that Putin fails in this catastrophic invasion of Ukraine.""  Johnson was part of a secure video call with President Biden and the leaders of France and Germany on Monday, during which they discussed the latest in the crisis, according to a readout from the White House, as well as underscoring their commitment to assist Ukraine. Observers worry that while the U.S. is playing a leading and pivotal role in the Ukraine crisis, there is still a perceived lack of leadership coming from the president.  ""Biden is not the leader of the free world right now, and for an American president to cede that role is career-threatening,"" Alan Mendoza the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society in England told Fox News Digital.  Mendoza believes  Boris Johnson  is one world leader who could be capable of filling the void on the world stage, even with an embarrassing scandal during the COVID crisis noting his impressive leadership skills.   ""With the future of the free world in the balance, we clearly have bigger problems than debating the minutiae of coronavirus regulations. But I think the crisis also plays to his strengths as a communicator and a visionary — Boris has always been good about creating a clear message about an issue, creating the intellectual space for it in a public forum, and then working with others to provide the detail. It was the secret of his success as London mayor, and for the first time he has been able to transpose it to the world stage.""  Clifford May, founder, and president of the  Foundation for Defense of Democracies  (FDD,) told Fox News Digital, ""Johnson has been articulate as always. More substantively, he’s pushing for the expulsion of ‘every Russian bank from SWIFT.’ He’s recognized that Europe needs to ‘wean itself off’ Russian oil and gas. And he’s on the record opposing ‘creeping normalization’ of Putin’s aggression. All that is helpful.""  Other world leaders who are getting some notice on the world stage include Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Bennett traveled to Moscow for a surprise visit with Putin over the weekend. Bennett was reportedly given the blessing by the U.S. for the meeting to try and mediate between the two sides.    Israel has  good relations  with both Ukraine and Russia, and Bennett is seen as having good ties to Zelenskyy, whom he has been in constant  contact  with over the last few days. Bennett also flew to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz before going back to Israel, according to the Associated Press.

       (Sputnik/Evgeny Biyatov/Kremlin via REUTERS) Clifford May said Bennett needed to be applauded but that his task isn’t an easy one.  ""Bennett is doing his best to be an honest broker. The Israelis are in a tough position because Russian military forces are — literally, not figuratively — just across their northern border in Syria, a nation that has been ravaged thanks to Putin and of course his friends in Tehran. Will Bennett’s diplomatic efforts succeed? Highly doubtful but I give him an A for effort.""  BIDEN MUST ADDRESS US HOSTAGES IN RUSSIA AMID UKRAINE WAR, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT SAYS German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is another name being touted as someone who has taken a stand on Russia having changed a years-old policy path on his country’s dealings with them. May told Fox News Digital, ""The most dramatic transition we’ve seen is Germany. Olaf Scholz now appears to recognize that Putin is a threat to Germany and the European Union.""  Yet while Scholz has changed his country’s post-war policy of not supplying lethal weapons to war zones by allowing weapons to be sent to Ukraine. The Associated Press reported that those included the shipment 1000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to air-missiles.  Yet still an Achilles heel for the Germans and some others in the European Union is their dependency on Russian energy. Reuters reported that Scholz on Monday said in a statement that sanctioning the Russian energy sector was still not on the cards.

       (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) The FDD’s May concluded that Scholz ""seems to understand, as his predecessor, Angela Merkel, never did, that close commercial ties with Russia would not be of mutual benefit. Scholz needs to do more — for example, he needs to persuade former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to sever his lucrative links with Putin — but what we’ve seen over recent days is encouraging.""  Yet while France tries to play a role in the crisis, especially on the humanitarian front, Alan Mendoza from the Henry Jackson Society says Macron has been an under-performer so far.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Macron is playing domestic politics for his re-election and is being typically different to the rest of Europe in order to show his voters France still has a voice,"" Mendoza said, adding that it’s working since nobody thinks he is any danger of losing the election that is set for this coming April.   ",2022-03

And Cotton, a potential 2024 GOP White House hopeful, will also argue that former GOP Presidents Ronald Reagan and  Donald Trump  are share key common roots and that those who charge that the Republican Party must choose between one or the other are mistaken.

ZELENSKYY WINS RONALD REAGAN FREEDOM AWARD In an interview with Fox News Digital, the foundation's executive director John Heubusch said it shared the news of the award with Zelenskyy by letter, which was delivered by Chairman Fred Ryan during a meeting with Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.     
      Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seen in a Zoom call with U.S. senators on Saturday, March 5, 2022. 
       (Sen. Marco Rubio) ""It is a very big deal, and not something that is given annually, but, rather, at events and moments like we’re seeing here, when a world leader steps forward with the kind of courage Ronald Reagan would admire, to fight for freedom,"" Heubusch told Fox News. ""And that’s precisely what President Zelenskyy is doing."" ""We look forward, after he is victorious here in fighting Putin and Russia, to giving him that award in person someday,"" Heubusch said. The award is considered the ""highest civilian honor"" bestowed by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute, and is given to those who have made ""monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide."" In May 1992, President Reagan gave the award to former General Secretary and President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.     
      President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev outside the villa Fleur D'Eau at Versoix near Geneva, on Nov. 19, 1985.
       (AP) ""How times have changed, right?"" Heubusch told Fox News Digital. ""Because, Gorbachev, who dismantled the former Soviet Union, was one of the first world leaders to receive the award, personally from Ronald Reagan in 1992. BIDEN ADMIN SAYS ‘NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE’ ON POSSIBLE BAN OF RUSSIAN OIL ""Thirty years later, Zelenskyy is fighting a tyrant who is trying to glue the Soviet Union back together,"" Heubusch said. ""So what goes around, comes around."" On June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to deliver on international peace and progressive policies. His challenge was heard around the world during a speech that marked a turning point in the Cold War.  ""General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here, to this gate,"" Reagan said. ""Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" The award has also been given to then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the late Colin Powell; Yitzhak Rabin, former prime minister of Israel; former President of Poland Lech Walesa; Bob Hope, the ambassador of ""Goodwill""; former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; and former President George H.W. Bush, among others. One characteristic all award recipients have in common, Heubusch told Fox News, is ""a willingness to fight for freedom.""  ""Any one word that people associate with Reagan is the word freedom,"" Heubusch told Fox News Digital. Zelenskyy was sworn in as the president of Ukraine on May 20, 2019, and has become the ""face of Ukraine's resistance against  Russian President Vladimir Putin's  invading forces,"" the Reagan Foundation said, adding that while he was a ""political novice with no military background, President Zelenskyy has earned the respect of Ukraine and those around the world by refusing to flee the capital, urging Ukrainians to resist, and crafting a successful communications strategy that has won over European leaders and citizens.""    Video ""I would say, isn’t it interesting, that President Zelenskyy, a former entertainer, was frowned upon and underestimated? So, too, was a guy named Ronald Reagan — a former actor who, some even in his own party, frowned upon. And look how both stories have turned out,"" Heubusch said.  ""Both were men of incredible courage and were willing to do anything to fight for freedom — Zelenskyy is proving that now and doing so every single day."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Meanwhile, Heubusch, on behalf of the Reagan Foundation & Institute, said their ""hope is that the U.S. will do everything it conceivably can to support Zelenskyy, and that definitely includes the cessation of any goods or services, including oil and gas, from Russia."" ""We also believe that, right now, we’re in the middle of a little ‘too little, too late,’ and our hope is that the Biden administration pours it on, because if they don’t Ukraine could go in the way of the former captive nation.""

""They are watching the world’s reaction to what’s happening in Ukraine, and that makes it all the more important that Zelenskyy is successful here and all the more important that we support him,"" Heubusch said.  Heubusch told Fox News Digital that, in the long term, he believes that Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people ""are going to be victorious.""

   ‘Red Notice’ author and financier Bill Browder joined Fox News Contributor  Douglas Murray , Thursday, to discuss how the bill he fought for, the Magnitsky Act, could be used to further sanction  Russia . In his ‘ Battle for Ukraine ’ appearance on  Fox Nation , Browder explained how he discovered and exposed ‘massive corruption’ during his time as the ‘largest foreign investor’ in  Russia  before  President Vladimir Putin  expelled him from the country in 2005 - and why he believes the Magnitsky Act might be the best way to stop him in his tracks. RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES BILL BROWDER:   The Magnitsky Act, which freezes the assets and bans the Visas of human rights abusers…in Russia. It passed in the United States on December 14, 2012. It now exists in 34 other countries. And Vladimir Putin has come after me personally in most dramatic ways with death threats, kidnappings threats… extradition requests, and everything else you can think of. … We've just begun the sanctions program, and there's a lot more we can do. There are probably north of 100 oligarchs who look after Putin's assets that are the richest people in Russia; we've sanctioned less than 10 of them. We should sanction all 100. On top of that, currently 70% of the banks in Russia are disconnected from the SWIFT banking network; all banks should be disconnected from SWIFT. On top of that, there should be an absolute government policy to make everybody disinvest from Russia. We should starve Putin of money in every possible way we can.

   In President  Joe Biden ’s address to the nation last Thursday, following the Russian land, sea, and air invasion of Ukraine, he admitted that no one thought sanctions would stop President Vladimir Putin from carrying out the largest attack against a European state since World War II. Let’s set aside that Biden admitted his own strategy in anticipation of the invasion was flawed – even though his administration considered it a certainty. If he didn’t expect sanctions to stop Putin, what then did he think would deter the crisis in  Ukraine  from erupting?  Apparently, the Biden administration bet the  Chinese Communist Party  would help out.  CHINA REMAINS ‘ALL IN FOR PUTIN,’ CHINESE-RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICIES ARE ‘HIGHLY COORDINATED,’ GORDON CHANG SAYS The New York Times last Friday, reported, ""Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade, according to U.S. officials.""     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to female flight attendants in comments broadcast on state television on Saturday, March 5, 2022. (Image: Reuters Video)
       ( ) After one of the talks in December, the Biden administration learned that instead of Communist China’s officials persuading Putin to pull back, ""Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord – and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions.""   Video Reading between the lines, this sudden release of information by the Biden administration appears to spin the message that President Biden tried to stop Putin’s invasion months ago, and he blames the Chinese Communist Party for not following his request. As former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and I detailed in ""Trump vs China: Facing America’s Greatest Threat , ""   the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for a lengthy list of violent, oppressive, and deceitful transgressions – not least of which includes the genocide in Xinjiang, the coverup of the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the elimination of freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong. CHINA TOUTS ‘FRIENDSHIP’ WITH RUSSIA: ‘MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER’ If you study the actions of the Chinese Communist Party since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, it is clear their officials’ response to the U.S. request should be expected. It’s perfectly in accordance with the Party’s pursuit to make China the global superpower by 2049.    Video Why on Earth would the president of the United States of America rely on an adversary to diffuse a dangerous escalation by a foreign dictator? Further, while the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin do not have a formal alliance, they are strategic partners (meaning that when it benefits General Secretary Xi Jinping and President Putin, they work together). REPS. KIM, SLOTKIN INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO INVESTIGATE CHINA SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE Before this year, Xi and Putin met 37 times. Just last month, they met again and issued a more than  5,000-word joint statement  which articulated a ""redistribution of power in the world"" and criticized the United States by name six times. Xi affectionately refers to Putin as his ""best friend.""  For evidence of their transactional comradery, look no further than the photos of Xi and Putin  making pancakes  together in 2018, taking a boat cruise along the Neva River in 2019, or the cake and ice cream that Putin gave Xi on his 66th birthday.    Video Did the administration honestly believe that the Chinese Communist Party didn’t know what Russia had planned for Ukraine? Did the White House think Communist China would really side with the United States and stop Putin? What did President Biden honestly think these two ""best friends"" discussed when Putin went to China for the Genocide Olympics last month?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It was never in Communist China’s interest to stop Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Ultimately, the Chinese Communist Party benefits from this aggression in the long term. First, the Party gets to learn the U.S. playbook for dealing with conflict between foreign countries (adding to what China learned about U.S. military tactics during the Gulf War in real-time). Sharing our intelligence with Communist China also could expose U.S. sources and methods of intelligence gathering in Russia.

       ( ) Now, regarding the possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the western response to the invasion of Ukraine may have given Xi cause for concern. However, the attack on Ukraine isn’t necessarily a perfect analogue. The U.S. economic relationship is much different with Russia than it is with China. We’ve repeatedly seen American companies fail to condemn the Chinese Communist Party for its genocide in Xinjiang. Instead, they pressure U.S. politicians to kill legislation that would hold the Party accountable.  Furthermore, while Washington and media are watching Russia, the Chinese Communist Party is once again able to return to the playbook of Deng Xiaoping – hiding its capabilities and biding its time.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After all, Congress remains gridlocked on enacting policies that strengthen America and counter the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions (only three of 238 bills targeting China passed in Congress as of December 2021), and President Biden has done a 180 degree turn from President Trump’s leadership in making this a priority. Amid these revelations, and in the aftermath of the weak State of the Union address, it is evident America needs a leader who will boldly and courageously stand up to the most dangerous threats our country currently faces.

   As the United States and the West impose heavy sanctions on  Russia  amid its invasion of Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov demanded that any Ukraine-related sanctions not interfere with potential business with Iran as Russia serves as an intermediary in restoring a new nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran.  National security experts running for Congress slammed Biden for giving Russia ""leverage"" amid the Ukraine war. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""Russia being given an intermediary role in the shaping of the Iran deal is ludicrous and is handing leverage over to Russia,"" Terry Namkung, a 20-year Air Force veteran and founder of a renewable energy company, told Fox News Digital.

       (Terry Namkung) ""When you consider how much leverage Russia already has because – thanks in large part to Joe Biden – they’ve forced dependency on us and on Europe through their oil production, it puts the United States in a precarious position to give Russia even more leverage,"" Namkung, a candidate for Congress in Virginia's 3rd Congressional District, added. Talks to reestablish the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which former President Trump formally withdrew in May 2018, began in April 2021. Iran has refused to negotiate directly with the U.S., so other parties to the agreement, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the European Union, have served as intermediaries,  The Wall Street Journal reported . Lavrov appeared to leverage this position to combat potential sanctions this past Saturday.

Gina Ciarcia, wife to a retired Marine officer and a candidate for Congress in Virginia's 7th Congressional District, warned that President Biden is giving Russian President Vladimir Putin ""more leverage"" by having Russia act as an intermediary in the talks. She noted that Russia's status as a key oil producer for Europe limits the West's ability to counter Putin, and these Iran negotiations make things worse.

""Biden seems constitutionally incapable of putting America first, but unfortunately our adversaries don’t have this same issue."" ""President Biden is allowing a war criminal [Putin] to serve as an intermediary for the world’s leading state sponsor of terror,"" Jason Killmeyer, a national security expert and Republican running for Congress in  Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District , told Fox News Digital.

""Should [Biden] go through with this deal, a new Axis will likely form, consisting of Russia, China, and Iran,"" Killmeyer said.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Russia 's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in unforeseen obstacles and challenges that make victory a near impossibility as casualties continue to mount amid crippling sanctions, according to a letter purportedly authored by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies.  The more than 2,000-word report by a whistleblower in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, said the number of Russians killed in the conflict could number 10,000, a figure in line with  Ukrainian  estimates and in stark contrast to the 498 reported by the Kremlin last week.  The report said Russia doesn't have an accurate number of its death count after losing contact with military units inside the country.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Russia was also unprepared to deal with the effects of the global sanctions it now faces as the ruble continues to plunge, the letter said.  ""No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one prepared for such sanctions,"" the report said. ""It’s just that there is no option for a possible victory."" Meanwhile, officers were pressured to tailor reports to the narrative desired by Russian leaders.  ""We have been increasingly pressed to customize reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this topic,"" the author claims. ""All these political consultants, politicians and their retinue, influence teams - all this created chaos.""

""Even with minimum resistance from the Ukrainians we'd need over 500,000 people, not including supply and logistics workers,"" the author claims. The letter also compared Russia's failure to conquer Ukraine with the mistake made by Nazi Germany in World War II. The author said it remains to be seen whether leaders will start a conflict with Europe in an effort to reduce the sanctions.  ""Now I do not rule out that then we will be drawn into a real international conflict, like (former Nazi German leader Adolf) Hitler in 1939.

They had no doubt that the author was a colleague, he said.  Grozev was skeptical about its authenticity but said the ""letter appeared different"" in that it came from a reputable source and was ""way longer than a forger would choose to make it."" Still, the letter could be part of a disinformation attempt from Ukraine, said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

She cited the author's reference to Hitler as one example.  ""The Hitler thing. This is a Western narrative,"" she added. ""The Russians hate Hitler, but it's unlikely for them to compare Putin with Hitler.""   Video The author of the letter addressed whether Putin would initiate a nuclear strike against the West.  ""Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike? Yes. Not for military purposes (it will not give anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others,"" the report said.  He added that the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service, was ""digging the earth"" for evidence that Ukraine has secretly created nuclear weapons to justify such a strike.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""From the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that VV Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world,"" the author states.

   American pundits and liberal journalists have bent over backward to compare Ukrainians getting  bombed and killed  during Russia’s ongoing attack to the plight of Americans under Republican rule.  Ukraine has been devastated since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion that has resulted in civilian deaths, destruction of cities and over 1.7 million refugees as women and children attempt to flee the war-torn nation. While Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, some pundits have been equating literal war to things such as voting rights and the Jan 6 Capitol riot. District Media Group President Beverly Hallberg told Fox News Digital that hyperbolic comments simply ""shut off dialog we should have on important issues"" in the United States.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: ZELENSKYY URGES GLOBAL BOYCOTT OF RUSSIAN PRODUCTS IF WAR CONTINUES

They make these comparisons because there are little to no Biden administration victories to highlight, so they are trying to win midterms by keeping Jan. 6 and voting laws in the news,"" Hallberg added. ""But it will be to their own detriment as the American people see very clearly what war is and what it isn’t."" While the American people might realize the difference between war and liberal talking points, many members of the corporate media haven’t gotten the message.  The Atlantic's David Frum appeared on CNN last week and urged President Biden to blame the invasion of Ukraine on Republican ideology.  ""These events have given the absolute lie to the false and idiotic idea of America First, America alone, our allies are worthless, having friends is not important,"" Frum said.  MARIA BARONOVA FEARS ‘WE’RE ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR WAR’ AFTER QUITTING RUSSIAN STATE-RUN MEDIA OVER UKRAINE Biden’s State of the Union address last Tuesday was the impetus for much of the punditry.   ""The end of the speech was about American values just as it was in the beginning when he was talking about Ukraine and Biden wanting to make the point that American unity is one of the things that he was elected to foster is still on the agenda,"" CNN senior political correspondent Abby Phillip said.      
      Liberal pundits weren’t happy when President Biden failed to connect domestic issues to Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
       (Saul Loeb, Pool via AP) RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES MSNBC anchors appeared particularly peeved that Biden didn’t tie Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine to what the liberal network considers threats to American democracy.  Joy Reid said Biden had an opportunity to ""take a really solid hit at Republicans for having supported Vladimir Putin,"" but whiffed on the chance. ""He did not mention the January 6 insurrection,"" Reid added. ""If you want to talk about a profound hit to our democracy, there’s nothing more profound than a violent physical attack on the very building he's standing in. That did not make it into the speech, I found that interesting.""  ""There are critics, including Democrats, some really wanted him to tie the fight for democracy in Ukraine to the voting rights struggles and the challenges with American democracy here at home. He did not do that,"" correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said.  SHOULD RUSSIAN JOURNALIST WHO QUIT STATE TV AFTER CONDEMNING UKRAINE INVASION FEAR FOR HER LIFE?

""We’re seeing the Republican Party bleed it by 1,000 cuts.""  On Sunday, NBC’s Chuck Todd also dinged Biden for failing to make the comparison during his first State of the Union.  ""If there was one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad, with the fight for democracy at home,"" Todd said on ""Meet the Press.""  Princeton University professor Eddie Glaude, a guest on the show, agreed and declared he was ""stunned"" at Biden’s missed opportunity.  ""I was stunned. I mean it was an easy kind of rhetorical move,"" Glaude said. ""Let’s defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home.""  PUTIN IS ‘TRYING BUT FAILING’ TO CONTROL UKRAINE INVASION NARRATIVE BY SHUTTING DOWN NON-STATE MEDIA Todd then declared it would have been ""politically helpful"" if Biden could have somehow connected Ukraine to issues in America.  ""We have to address the question of what's happening across the country in terms of the assault on voting rights. And we would also have to address the illiberal forces within our country that are driving the challenge to voter rights. So I didn't understand it and I thought it was a mistake,"" Glaude said.  Last week, Todd was part of a similar conversation with Sharpton on MSNBC.  ""I'm curious, you know, to me, this moment of Bloody Sunday and what we're seeing in Europe, there is a connection. It's a fight for freedom, it’s a fight for democracy. And Rev, it’s a statement I thought we would hear from the president on Tuesday that connected the two. He didn't quite do that,"" Todd told Sharpton on ""MTP Daily.""  WHOOPI GOLDBERG: 'BONEHEAD' TRUMP WOULD HAVE JUST HANDED UKRAINE TO RUSSIA Sharpton was in lockstep with Todd, making an apparent play for sprawling Democratic election overhauls that are currently stalled in Congress. ""You cannot fight, and you should, for the right for the people of Ukraine to have a democratic state and make decisions based on voting and then not deal with that same right to be upheld here in America,"" Sharpton said. ""So, as we look for and pray for the people in Ukraine, we need to also deal domestically. And I think that connection is very clear, and we need to make it clear."" Sharpton later added, ""We need to underscore that we cannot be global liberators and at home ignore the threat to democracy right here."" Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor feels that journalists are typically eager to do the left’s job for them.  ""In this case, that means tying a monstrous invasion to election laws in a free nation. It’s not about facts or even pushing a legitimate argument. It’s about Todd, Sharpton and the rest of the media mob pretending anyone who isn’t a leftist is akin to being a dictator,"" Gainor told Fox News Digital.  ""There’s no ‘fight for democracy at home’ to use Chuck Todd’s words, unless you mean stopping the Biden administration from abusing the First Amendment and pushing censorship,"" Gainor said, noting that voter ID is supported by the majority of Americans.  ""Every demographic group supports that -- just not any of the network news media,"" he said.  DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said this kind of punditry is ""quite misguided"" and will further damage the media’s already tarnished reputation.  ""America is polarized politically, to be sure, but to compare America's policy struggles to Ukraine's desperate military fight for survival makes no sense at all. The pundits engaging in this kind of extreme rhetoric are certainly trying to exploit a serious international crisis in order to make political smears at home,"" McCall told Fox News Digital. ""The American media has a role to play in providing informed and rational analysis of both international and domestic challenges and this kind of flame throwing only contributes to diminishing public trust in media."" Meanwhile, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams even compared herself to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an appearance on Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show"" last week. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We are a stronger nation when we allow people to participate. And if we ever doubted that, the war that Putin is waging against Ukraine, President Zelenskyy said it -- I'm going to paraphrase him probably poorly -- he said this isn't a war on Ukraine. This is a war on democracy in Ukraine. When we allow democracy to be overtaken by those who want to choose who can be heard, and those choices are not based on anything but animus or inconvenience, then that is wrong. My mission is to make certain that everyone can cast a ballot,"" Abrams said.  Abrams was swiftly mocked for the comparison, and others found issue with host Trevor Noah’s silence.  ""Although he’s a comedy host and not a journalist, Noah still should’ve called Abrams out for that analogy because fighting against voter ID laws does not make you the same type of politician as one who has Russian hits squads coming after him because Moscow falsely labels him a Nazi,"" NewsBusters’ Alex Christy observed.   ",2022-03

   One of the most unexpected reactions to Vladimir Putin’s  ruthless invasion of Ukraine  has been the muscular response of a West supposedly in decline.   Previously both Europe and the United States were indifferent in their responses to the successful Russian invasions of Georgia, Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. When  Putin went medieval  on a stubborn Chechnya in 1999-2000 and nearly leveled its capital of Grozny, the West was again mostly ineffectual.   More recently, the August 2021  American skedaddle from Afghanistan  marked the worst humiliation of the U.S. military in 50 years. Fleeing Americans left their sandbagged NATO allies hanging in Kabul. The hasty retreat further emphasized the disunity of the alliance.   END UKRAINE SLAUGHTERE AND STAND UP TO RUSSIA, AMERICANS TELL BIDEN IN NEW POLL Most NATO members had followed the German lead in refusing to pay their promised investments in military readiness.     Video So, Putin had some cause to believe that his current invasion of Ukraine would elicit the same anemic response, and that his war would be won in two or three days.   President Biden had successfully fought a congressional effort to sanction the German-Russian Nord Strom 2 pipeline. Biden was sluggish in supplying American Javelin and Stinger weapons to Ukraine when months ago Russia began massing troops on its border.   Biden also cut back American oil and gas drilling by closing down federally controlled leases and productive fields, canceling the pipelines, and discouraging lending agencies to promote fossil fuel production. In default of energy independence, Biden even begged a hostile Putin to pump more oil.    Suddenly NATO and EU members have acted more like the rowers at the battle of Lepanto than loud green pacifists.   Putin concluded that the West in general, and America in particular, were in disarray and decline. He remembered Barack Obama’s 2012 hot-mic, quid-pro-quo deal with the Russians, and his refusal to sell Ukraine offensive weapons. He recalled the anti-American German public opinion polls, and the presence of ex-German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder on the Russian Gazprom board of directors.   The 120 days of unchecked American riots in summer 2020 coupled with a U.S. wide-open border, energy curtailment, high inflation, bitter impending midterm elections, and internal discord convinced Putin that America could care less about Ukraine.    Video But suddenly NATO and EU members have acted more like the rowers at the battle of Lepanto than loud green pacifists. New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lectured his parliament that Germany would now refute its last 20 years of Russian appeasement. Berlin would supposedly develop its own fossil fuel reserves, end energy dependence on Putin’s Russia, rearm, and meet all its prior broken NATO promises.   Suddenly, other NATO members dropped their usual anti-American, ankle-biting boilerplate and outdid each other in promises to rush sophisticated weapons to Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron answered a saber-rattling Putin in near Trumpian style, by reminding the world that NATO too had a deadly nuclear deterrent.     Video European financial ministers sought to outdo their American treasury counterparts in discovering creative new measures to sanction, and, indeed, bankrupt the Russian war machine.   If Americans still believed that European energy policy is always hostage to extremist Green parties, they should look in the mirror. The American Left is more terrified of its woke green base than German socialists are of their own radical environmentalists.  What caused the Western reawakening – and will it last?    Video Most obviously, Ukraine fought the Russians in a manner few expected. Its blood-and-guts resistance shamed Ukraine’s European neighbors. They concluded that a non-NATO frontier state had done more to hurt Putin than all the loud communiques from NATO headquarters.   Whereas Western leaders temporize and once talked in platitudes in fear of disrupting the status quo, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy roamed everywhere on the battlefield. The supposedly invincible Putin in contrast looked bloated, confused, petulant and terrified of catching a bug – even as the ubiquitous Zelenskyy spurned the likelihood of catching a bullet.  The West likewise woke up to the reality that its weapons like Javelin and Stingers were superior to those of both China and Russia. The West, not Moscow or Beijing, still controls world financial markets.     Video Despite its reckless spending and inflation, the West still controls the flow of money and investment. Their sanctions threaten not just to hurt but even to destroy Putin.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Will such Western confidence last?   If Putin finally crushes Ukraine like he did Chechnya, and if China then talks loudly of doing the same to Taiwan, the new woke West will have its uplifting rhetoric tested by a far tougher reality of confronting two angry and preening nuclear states.   If Zelenskyy fails, and gasoline stays at astronomical levels,  there will be tremendous pressure on individual Western nations to go rogue and cut a deal with Putin and by extension China.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, the verdict is out on the new Churchillian West.   But for now, it was welcome to see Europe and America put an end to their woke apologies, and instead to be encouraged by their proud shared past to face defiantly a dangerous present.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM VICTOR DAVIS HANSON  ",2022-03

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Yesterday morning, Joe Biden's secretary of state, a man called Tony Blinken, went on to the Sunday show over at CBS News to announce new policy toward Russia. Going forward, Blinken explained, the Biden administration will use Poland as a cutout to send fighter jets to the government of Ukraine. Those jets will be used to fight the Russian military. Blinken announced this in a calm, even tone that suggested this was conventional procedure, business as usual, nothing to worry about, just another weekend at the State Department. But in fact, it's not typical. It's a very big step. It could turn out to be a pivot point in history and for that reason, we want you to know entire exchange.  CBS ANCHOR:  If, for instance, the Polish government, a NATO member, wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the US or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?   SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN:  No, ...that gets a green light. In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to..the Ukrainians. What could we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they're handing over to…the Ukrainians?   BILL BARR REACTS TO WAR IN UKRAINE AS ‘HARROWING TO WATCH,’ SAYS RUSSIA IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISHED’       
      U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a media conference in Brussels on March 4, 2022. 
       (Olivier Douliery, Pool Photo via AP) ""Are you afraid that will escalate tension?,"" asks the scriptwriter, because even a CBS News anchor knows that sending fighter jets to a war usually does that. ""No,"" replies Tony Blinken, ""that gets a green light.""  It's a remarkable exchange. What are we watching here, apart from a conversation between two incredibly shallow people who have limited contact with reality? What we're watching is the beginning of a war between the United States and  Russia . If that sounds jarring, what else would you call it? Now you may support everything that Tony Blinken just said. Maybe you do support it, but let's not lie about what's happening. Let's be as honest and clear-eyed as we can be, especially now, because it matters. The Biden administration just inserted itself with force into the middle of a hot war between two foreign powers. That means the United States is now an active participant in a war. We are at war with Russia. Whether or not that war has been officially declared, whether or not Congress has authorized that war, all of that is irrelevant. That war is happening right now as we watch.   Why is no one in Washington saying anything about this? Because they support it. They always have. Almost five years ago, way back in 2017, Rep. Eric Swalwell of  California  came on this show for another Russiagate debate, one of many. He came to let us know how Vladimir Putin had gotten Donald Trump elected president. It was all as stupid as you remember, it until the end of the interview when Swalwell said something odd and interesting. Swalwell explained that because Putin had installed Donald Trump secretly in the White House, the United States should now ""do everything we can to expand NATO's role."" In other words, we should let Ukraine join NATO. That's odd. Why would he say that? Why would a policy so seemingly obscure— NATO, Ukraine, What?— Why would that be a priority for some forgettable congressman from the East Bay?   Well, simple, because getting Ukraine to join NATO was the key to inciting war with Russia. We didn't get it at the time. Now it's obvious. Vladimir Putin just invaded Ukraine because he didn't want Ukraine to join NATO. Putin certainly had other motives as well. People always do have multiple motives, but that's the main reason Russia invaded. The Russians don't want American missiles on their border. They don't want a hostile government next door.   Now that's true, whether you're allowed to say it in public right now or not, it has been true for a long time. A lot has been written about this over many years by serious people. No one who knows anything and is honest will tell you Putin invaded Ukraine simply because he is evil. Putin may be evil. He certainly seems to be, but he also has strategic motives in doing that, whether or not you agree with those motives, that's irrelevant. Those are the facts. So, with those facts in mind, the Biden administration's behavior in the days before the Ukraine invasion tells you a lot about what motivated them.   With Russian troops amassed by the thousands on the Ukrainian border, Joe Biden sent Kamala Harris, the least capable diplomat in Washington, to explain America's policy to European heads of state. At a public press event at the Munich Security Conference, Kamala Harris encouraged Ukraine to become a member of NATO. ""I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy's desire to join NATO."" Message: Up yours, Vladimir Putin, go ahead and invade Ukraine. And of course, Vladimir Putin did that just days later.   SAVING UKRAINE: LOOKING FOR A WORLD LEADER TO STAND UP       
      In this photo, Feb. 27, 2022, taken from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to the nation in Kyiv, Ukraine. 
       (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP, File) So, the invasion was no surprise to the Biden administration. They knew that would happen. That was the point of the exercise. We watched all this happen. We missed it. How? Honestly, because it was insane and therefore very hard to take seriously. Why in the world would the United States intentionally seek war with Russia? How could we possibly benefit from that war? We still don't know the answer to that question, but it is obvious that permanent Washington has been fixated on war with Russia for a very long time.   A couple of years ago, you may remember, we'd forgotten, they impeached a sitting president. Why? For threatening to withhold military aid to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Failing to back a proxy war in Ukraine was the one thing Donald Trump was not allowed to do as president. Again, they impeached him for it and no one said much about it, even in his own party, because, of course, they supported war with Russia too— maybe even more than the Democrats did. As far back as 2016, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina— hysterical little Lindsey Graham— was jumping around, acting out his war fantasies in front of foreign soldiers in Ukraine. If we saw this tape at the time, we don't remember seeing it - back in 2016, Ukraine seemed like a faraway place. We should have paid more attention.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM:  Your fight is our fight. 2017 will be the year of offense. All of us will go back to Washington and we will push the case against Russia. Enough of … Russian aggression. It is time for them to pay a heavier price.   ""Your fight is our fight."" That's a very strange thing for an American lawmaker to say to a foreign military. Why would the Ukrainian government's fight in 2016 possibly be our fight? On what grounds is it our fight? What does that even mean? We don't know. And yet now it is demonstrably true. Ukraine's fight is our fight. Ukraine's war is our war. It's here, but most Americans did not see that coming—yet permanent Washington certainly did. Permanent Washington understood that the second Vladimir Putin's forces rolled across the border into Ukraine we would inevitably be on a course toward war with Russia. They knew. Here's the president of the August Council on Foreign Relations on the day of the invasion.   RICHARD HAASS:  We need now a response of necessity to his war of choice, and there's got to be to raise the economic costs at home, to raise the military costs on the ground. I hate to be so blunt, but, you know, the most vulnerable thing that the Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. So, we have to make sure Ukraine has the means to...resist.   ""Dead Russian soldiers."" At the time, that seemed a little bellicose right out of the gate. It had just happened. Maybe there's some way to deescalate this. The invasion is terrible, but isn't America's role as steward of the West to make things better? Wouldn't a prompt Russian withdrawal from Ukraine be the wisest course for everyone, including and especially the Ukrainians on whose behalf we claim to speak, but whose country would be leveled by a protracted war? You would think so, but that's not what anyone in Washington wanted. They wanted a war and now they have one.   UKRAINIAN FILM STAR, 33, KILLED IN RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR WHILE DEFENDING COUNTRY   So, where's this going? That's the question for the rest of us who had no role in making these decisions. Well, it's worrisome. You should keep in mind that the U.S. government is currently run by the same people who planned the Afghanistan withdrawal, the ones who tanked the U.S. dollar, the people who run Baltimore, the ones who tried to send crack pipes to junkies, these are people with a long history of destroying things and no history at all of building anything. So, a lot could go wrong. They tell us that Vladimir Putin is unbalanced. We'll take that at face value. We know that Putin has thousands of nuclear weapons. Putin has said that if he is pushed, he will use nuclear weapons. It could be wise to believe him.   Harry Kazianis does believe him. Kazianis is a foreign policy analyst in Washington. Like a lot of people in his business, he regularly participates in government-sponsored war games. These are designed to map out what would happen if various countries fell into conflict with one another. A couple of years ago, not long ago at all, Kazianis participated in a war game predicated on a war with Russia.   He wrote about this the other day in The Federalist. ""In the course of what we call the NATO-Russia War of 2019, we estimated one billion people died."" One billion. ""And if we aren't careful, what happened in a simulation could happen if a NATO-Russia war erupts over Ukraine.""  That war has just erupted. The fact that no one in charge seems to worry about where this could go should concern you quite a bit, but nuclear war is not the only risk. The economic consequences of this war are already profound. They're history changing, actually and if you don't believe it, check out commodity prices. They're out of control. Wheat is up nearly 60% over last year. That's the highest price ever recorded for wheat. It's not good news if you plan to eat and it won't get better. Russia is one of the largest fertilizer producers in the world. So, for example, a ton of Urea fertilizer that cost American farmers $265 per ton last January now goes for $846 this year. And thanks to sanctions, that number will get much higher. No one who farms has ever seen anything like this. You probably don't farm, but you do buy groceries. It'll be obvious to you soon.   In fact, thanks to Biden's foreign policy, everything you buy is shooting up in price and shockingly fast. Gasoline is now higher than it's ever been in the history of gasoline. In Los Angeles, it is selling for $7.29 a gallon. So if you make under $100,000 a year and most people in this country do, that qualifies as a crisis for you, but for the people in charge, it's not high enough. They'd like to make it worse. Their latest idea, that a lot of people seem to be buying, is that we have a moral obligation somehow to stop buying Russian oil. It's tainted.  OK. What would happen if we did that? Well, needless to say, oil prices would jump likely to over a $150 a barrel, even higher prices for you, but then if that boycott spread and moral boycotts tend to and Europe joined it, buckle your seatbelt.   We talked to someone in the energy business this morning, energy traders, to get a little perspective on this. He said a total boycott of Russian energy would cause ""an absolute global disaster."" That means recession, depression, uncontrollable inflation and the rest—economic devastation to us and our allies. And at that point, in fact, we're already there, we'd be forced to make up the difference by getting more oil from other countries because we need the energy. Batteries aren't going to supply it. So what would those countries be? Well, let's see. They would be pretty clear: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela.  To repeat, in order to wage a moral boycott, we become more dependent on Saudi Arabia, governed by Sharia law; Iran, a rogue state; and Maduro's Venezuela because this is a moral statement we're making. This is a moral victory so feel good about it as you go bankrupt. That's the short term picture. The long term picture of war with Russia is even scarier than that. Thanks to Biden's policies, Russia and China now form a bloc against the United States. This was the nightmare scenario, now it's real. Just today, the Chinese foreign minister described Vladimir Putin as China's ""most important strategic partner."" So are we going to see a boycott of Chinese goods in the United States? They're making this war possible. Oh, don't bet on it, that would be racist.   But we should prepare to lose our position as holder of the world's reserve currency. That is happening in slow motion. It's unmistakable. Now the Biden people seem to have no idea this is going on, or maybe they want it to happen. Joe Biden was up there at the State of the Union bragging about how he took 30 points off the Russian ruble in a single day. Hurray! Good for us, but once we stop celebrating our win, the destruction of the Russian economy, they deserve it, you got to wonder, is there a downside to this? Could it be a pyrrhic victory? Let's see. These policies have driven Russia, China, India, Turkey and other countries to accelerate their flight from the U.S. dollar.   LEAVING UKRAINE: THE DIFFICULT DECISION FOR SOME TO FLEE THEIR HOMELAND AMID RUSSIAN INVASION       
      Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin during their meeting in Moscow, Russia
       (Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) Now, to be clear, that's the majority of the global economy. This may be the most reckless and destructive thing any American president has ever done to the United States. If the war in Ukraine ended tomorrow, we would live with the consequences of that loss of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency for the rest of our lives.  No one in Washington is even acknowledging this is happening. They're looking for more moral victories to win. And the companies love it, the woke companies, Apple, MasterCard, lots of other American companies, are taking victory laps for their role in punishing Russia. Great. Punish Russia. We're not against that, but you've got to wonder. You've just seen a handful of woke corporations crash a country and impoverished its citizens indiscriminately. Now that country is Russia, so most of us aren't even thinking about the precedent it sets. We're fine with it. It's Russia. Who cares?  But is it possible these same techniques might be used someday against someplace or somebody that you care about? What if one morning you woke up and they decided that you're Vladimir Putin and you must be erased? Could that happen? Don't think about it. You probably aren't able to think about it clearly right now, even if you try. Why? Because there's a moral panic in progress.   For the record, this is the third moral panic we have had in the United States of America in less than two years. You don't want to live in a country in which moral panics break out regularly, by the way. Moral panics diminish the people engaged in them and hurt the people who don't. They're degrading. They're crazy. They're the opposite of what you want. You want to live in a country where wisdom and restraint and rational behavior and decency determine the outcomes, not screaming. But we live in a country of moral panics.   The first one began in May of 2020 with the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. That changed America completely. The second moral panic was  COVID . You've lived through that. So for nearly two years, the shouting has not ended. Hysteria is now the official language of public discourse in the United States. That's not good for anyone, except those benefiting from it. Who is benefiting? Anyone who lies for a living. The liars have perfect cover. Ask yourself: How much of what you first heard about BLM, and then about the coronavirus turned out in the end to be true? How many of the first stories were true? Not many. It was almost all lies, but you didn't know that at the time because you were busy being yelled at. If you dared to point out that actually all lives matter, they denounced you as a racist. If you expressed concern about vaccine mandates, of course, they called you an anti-vaxxer.   Sound familiar? The pattern never changes. Hey, maybe war with Russia is not a good idea for the United States. Say that out loud some time. It's not an extreme position. Most Americans would agree with you, but you will immediately be denounced as a tool of Putin. What is this? It's name-calling as a means of social control. The people in charge have decided their primary job is to decide who you should hate. In an environment like this, everything feels like propaganda and that's because much of it is.   On Thursday, we told you that Russian forces had bombed a nuclear reactor in Ukraine. That seemed to be true. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine had said it repeatedly, but it was not true. No reactors were hit. An unnamed Ukrainian official claimed that radiation levels in the area had risen. That turned out to be untrue as well. In the words of Mark Nelson, who is a nuclear energy analyst, ""I'm afraid to say, this looks like a coordinated effort to induce panic."" Of course. It was what we call disinformation and it was designed to get you to support a war against Russia. Now, maybe you support a war against Russia anyway, but you should at least know that you're being lied to and manipulated, which you are. Read this from Good Morning America the other day:     ABC CORRESPONDENT:   Ukraine's mothers, daughters, teachers, politicians, beauty queens, now on the front lines defending their country under siege and there is Anastasiia Lenna, a former Miss Grand Ukraine. Photos of her on Instagram in fatigues, rifle in hand. Underneath, patriotic hashtags.  Miss Ukraine with a rifle defending her homeland. Is there anything more inspiring than that? It would be more inspiring if it was real. It wasn't. It was fake. Miss Ukraine was not defending her homeland. That wasn't a rifle. It was an airsoft gun. So the whole thing was not a news story, though you read it as such. It was a propaganda shoot. It was meant to deceive you. It was meant to make you want war with Russia. Sympathize with one side over the other.  It works. That's why they do it. It's why the tech companies have censored so many news sites recently, including from Russia, but not exclusively from Russia. Now we're supposed to think this is a victory over Putin or something, but a victory for what? Less information? Fewer perspectives? If getting to the truth was the point of the exercise, we as American citizens would be able to read whatever we wanted to read. That was the rule for centuries in this country. It no longer is because truth is no longer the point.   Instead, Twitter and Facebook are proudly censoring any information that might ""undermine trust in Ukrainian government."" Really? Since when are we required to trust the Ukrainian government or any government? Don't ask.  By the way, over the weekend, because everything in America is unintentionally hilarious now, the New York Times attacked  Vladimir Putin  for censorship. Turns out he engaged in censorship and tries to control his people can read.   RUSSIAN PRO-WAR ‘Z’ SYMBOL: WHAT TO KNOW       
      This April 26, 2017, file photo shows the Twitter app icon on a mobile phone in Philadelphia. 
       (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Lost in the relentless focus on war in Ukraine, by the way, is any perspective about the world or war, which is always lacking in D.C., but never more so than now. The fighting in Ukraine is terrible, of course, you're seeing it happen. No decent person could fail to be moved by the images, but it's not unique. It's not the only war in recent memory or even currently in progress right now.   Many thousands died in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war that was between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ever heard of it? It ended less than a year and a half ago. No coverage. There's been a gruesome war underway in Ethiopia for a couple of years now. It's n progress as we speak. Tens of thousands, women have been raped by militiamen, many of them intentionally infected with AIDS. Can it get worse than that? How many people have died in the war in Ethiopia? We don't really know, because no one in our media cares enough to keep track. It's just Ethiopia. We do know that hundreds of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have died in the war in Yemen. It's a war the Biden administration has continued to fund. It doesn't get a lot of attention. It's just Yemen. Who cares?   All human life is equal. All of us are equal in the eyes of God. The death of someone in Ukraine is exactly equivalent to the death of someone in Yemen in its importance, period. But hardest of all to ignore, though our media have pulled it off and ignored it, is the civil war that's underway 100 hundred yards from El Paso, Texas, right now: the Mexican drug war. That's what we call it. It's likely killed more than 100,000 people.   In 2019 alone, close to 10,000 Mexican citizens just disappeared, most of them young men. More journalists are murdered in Mexico every year than in any other country in the world. The pictures are awful, but it's not a crisis. It's totally normal, says the Biden administration. Open the southern border. The border we care about is Ukraine's.   Now, Republicans in Washington, to their eternal shame, have no problem with any of this. In fact, many of them are more for war with Russia than Joe Biden seems to be. That is a disgrace. It will hurt them in the midterms. It will hurt them on some deeper level because it does not serve the interests of this country, a war fought on behalf of democracy that ignores the will of the country fighting it? At some point soon, we'll explain exactly what's going on here, but it's enough to know Republicans are not representing their voters when they move to a position that's way more warlike than Joe Biden's, when they embrace the lunacy that could really hurt this country, that aren't representing people like Bryce Mitchell. Bryce Mitchell seems like a Republican voter. He's a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter. He is a cattle farmer from Cabot, Arkansas. The other day, someone asked him what he thought about Ukraine at a press event. Here's what he said:     REPORTER:  Well, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the whole Russia and Ukraine situation.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP     Video BRYCE MITCHELL:  You know, here's my first thought, is I'm not going nowhere to fight none of these wars for these politicians. I'm staying at home and when the war comes to Arkansas, I will dig my boots in the ground and I will die for everything I love, and I will not retreat. If this country is invaded and everybody's saying, ""Well, ... we got to evacuate, we got to leave. We got.."" I will not. I will dig my boots in the Arkansas soil and I will fight for the people that I love, for the land that I love, and the way of life that I love, but I'm not going overseas to fight. I don't know what's going on to be honest, brother. I really don't. There's so much stuff and I don't think nobody knows what's going on fully. There's been so much political corruption in that area. You got Biden and his son making a sh-- ton of money off of using our tax dollars to bribe their people. That's treasonous, in my opinion. So you got [Joe] Biden and his son using our tax dollars. Hey, if ..Ukrainian government, if you don't do this, we're taking your tax dollars. He shouldn't be giving our tax dollars to that country anyway. We got veterans out here sleeping on the street and you're going to give our frickin tax dollars to these Ukrainians and... brother, I don't know what's going on over there, but I'm not going over there and fighting.   Tell us how he's a Putin stooge, Lindsey Graham and David Frum and Anne Applebaum, Liz Cheney. Tell us how he's immoral. When the war comes to Arkansas, he said, ""I will dig my boots into the ground and I will die for everything I love."" That's the American position. Fight to the death to defend what you love, your people, your family, your country, to defend it. That's why we call it the Defense Department. It is not called the Department of Nation Building or the Bureau of Trans Evangelism. Bryce Mitchell may not have good grammar, but he understands exactly what's going on here, even if the people who claim to represent him and our country have no idea.  This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the March 7, 2022 edition of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

While there, he helped the country with anti-corruption and economic metrics in its push to become a part of NATO.   Video CHINA TOUTS 'FRIENDSHIP' WITH RUSSIA: 'MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER' Fitzpatrick said Ukraine was falling short on those metrics because Putin ""constantly sent saboteurs"" into the country to erode its institutions, judicial system, police force and energy contracts, among other areas. Fitzpatrick told Fox News that the U.S. now needs to close all  Russian sanction loopholes , including seizing all assets and sanctioning 100% of their banks. He believes Russian exports must face sanctions worldwide, and we must target Russian energy and ban all of their imports into the U.S.

""A lot of these oligarchs funnel money to their children."" UKRAINE MILITARY TURNS VOLUNTEERS AWAY AS 140K UKRAINIANS COME HOME TO RIGHT RUSSIA   ""It's got to be all-encompassing,"" he continued. ""There can't be any carve-outs because we're worried about blowback on some of our respective economies because then you're just perpetuating the problem and kicking the can down the road."" ""You're going to have a far more costly problem in terms of economics and lives,"" Fitzpatrick told Fox News. Fitzpatrick said NATO must also implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a strategy  NATO nations have opposed . A no-fly zone could actively pit NATO forces against the Russians. Secretary Jens Stoltenberg called ruling out such a move a ""painful decision"" and said NATO has a responsibility not to escalate the conflict by engaging Russian forces directly in Ukraine, either on the ground or in the air.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Russia’s economy  is proving much less resilient than the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people. In the wake of the Russian invasion, countries across the world moved swiftly to disconnect President Vladimir Putin’s war machine from the global market, and the result is an economy in freefall. Unsurprisingly, the  Chinese Communist Party  refuses to join in the sanctions. But Communist China is not Putin’s only supporter.  Recent reporting reveals that Iran is supplying  Russia  with illicit oil supplies to finance his war in Ukraine. This is alarming to say the least, because America and its allies are on the verge of providing a $10 billion windfall to the terrorist regime in Tehran.  RUSSIAN OFFICIAL SAYS ‘IRAN GOT MUCH MORE THAN IT EXPECTED’ IN REVIVED NUCLEAR TALKS For reasons that are still unclear, the Biden administration has long sought to revive the failed Obama-era 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Reports suggest an agreement is imminent, with the lead Russian negotiator in the talks saying Russia and China teamed up and ""Iran got much more than it could expect. Much more."" Whether that is an exaggeration or not, removing sanctions and allowing the sale of Iranian oil across the globe would be a massive victory for Tehran — and a massive loss for the U.S.   Video While most of the media coverage this week will focus on rising oil prices, this Wednesday also marks 15 years since the Iranian government kidnapped Florida resident and former FBI agent Bob Levinson.  Levinson was held in captivity for longer than any other U.S. citizen in history. For 10 years, I worked with his family to secure information about his status and bring him home. Tragically, Levinson died in captivity sometime in 2020. The Iranian authorities still deny responsibility for his capture and death.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER We know from experience how Tehran will use its windfall. When the Obama administration established the first nuclear deal in 2015, Iran did not live up to its end of the bargain. On the contrary, Tehran used its newfound funds to develop its ballistic missile program, strengthen Hezbollah and the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and crack down on domestic dissent. All the while, the Iranian authorities  continued  nuclear weaponization experiments at a secret facility.

President Biden is desperate to bring energy costs down without upsetting the fanatical left wing of this party, so desperate that he would rather import bloodstained Iranian oil than permit further energy exploration in the U.S.  He is also running to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as if foreign oil were better for the climate than American oil. This is pathetic, and Americans deserve better. The family of Bob Levinson deserves better.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By reviving the failed Iran deal, the Biden administration will fill the coffers of a murderous, terrorist regime, without putting an end to Iran’s nuclear weaponization.

   President Biden  and congressional Democrats who have championed green energy policies while calling to shift away from domestic oil drilling are facing an uphill battle ahead of the midterm elections, as gas prices continue to climb from near-record highs following  Russia's  invasion of Ukraine. During his State of the Union address last week, Biden announced that the U.S. is releasing 30 million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect consumers from the rising prices during the Russia-Ukraine war, but prices have kept rising. The national average has crested over $4 and  set an all-time record  on Monday.  REPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN STOP FUNDING PUTIN'S WAR WITH OIL PURCHASES Republicans argue that Biden has given Putin leverage by continuing Russian oil purchases while canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and freezing new oil and gas leases on federal lands. They accuse him of funding Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine by refusing to sanction Russia’s  oil  and gas sector.

""We have seen a 50% increase in energy prices since President Biden took office, and the Russian war in Ukraine will only cause these prices to climb,"" Bilirakis said. ""Instead of flipping the switch and saying yes to American energy, the President is inexplicably doubling down on failed strategies. We need to readjust our entire thinking with the understanding that energy security is national security."" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who also sits on the committee, agreed. ""President Biden should immediately reverse his devastating policies that are causing gas prices to skyrocket and are giving Putin leverage against the rest of the world and return to the policies that were working under President Trump to create American energy dominance with gas prices below $2 a gallon,"" Scalise said.

""That cash helped insulate Russia from sanctions and shifted Putin’s calculus towards a full-scale invasion."" Banks’ memo listed several measures Biden could take to boost domestic oil production, including prohibiting the import of Russian oil and gas, ending the pause on new oil and gas leases and permits on U.S. federal lands, and fast-tracking pending liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permits. ""More than 99% of cars in the U.S. run on gas or diesel,"" Banks told Fox News Digital. ""I have no doubt gas prices will be one of the biggest issues of the midterm elections.

   Why hasn’t cyber figured more prominently in  Russia’s  war on Ukraine? Russia is, after all, a powerhouse in this area having successfully cyber-attacked Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2015-2016. Add to that an unexpectedly difficult start to the current, long-planned campaign against Ukraine and the question becomes even more perplexing. Analysts have many and varied views on the matter and recent reporting has laid out almost a dozen different potential explanations. Some suggest there is no need to go there, and that the possible downside outweighs any upsides. Others suggest that Putin may still go there - just not yet. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES The latter explanation is compelling if only because it requires us not to let down our guard and to continue marching forward on plans to expand and deepen America’s own cyber resilience posture and abilities to withstand cyber and electronic warfare. The good news is that certain key sectors that represent critical infrastructure and support vital national functions have been enhancing their defenses for years. Think financial services and energy for example.

Think water - which is working to up its game but is nowhere near where it needs to be as the recent spate of ransomware has made clear. And this is the state of play among the big dogs. Yet the U.S. is an incredibly target-rich environment for any adversary because of the sprawling decentralized nature of both its public and private sector. Put differently: Small and medium size enterprises are not outside the crosshairs.  JAMES JAY CARAFANO: WHAT CHINA IS LEARNING FROM PUTIN'S UKRAINE INVASION Officials have been working hard to raise awareness and offer assistance to both public and private entities that may not have the resources or ability to properly protect themselves on their own in the current climate that is so rife with potential cyber threats. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (better known as CISA) has been doing yeoman’s work in this area. But the scope of the challenge is enormous.   Video So where should we go from here? We must better marshal our efforts so that the piecemeal and uneven progress that has been made to date becomes a more streamlined national effort that makes it far harder for any adversary to achieve its ends. Having a National Cyber Director (NCD) to act as coordinator and definitively take point on the all-important task of prioritizing our game plans and facilitating their execution in a way that ensures that they will be more than just the sum of their parts is a true step forward.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But the NCD will not be able to go it alone. Public and private efforts must cohere and partnerships must be more meaningful than ever before. It’s a tall order but the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) under CISA auspices is a powerful tool that could rise to the challenge if all stakeholders determinedly make that their mission. Among its payoffs could be better situational awareness than the nation has ever had - and coordinated operations that give bad actors a serious run for their money.

   President Biden  on Tuesday said it is ""not true"" that his administration is holding back  domestic energy production , while warning that the United States’ ban of  Russian oil imports  will ""cost"" American families, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. Biden  on Tuesday warned that gas prices will ""go up further"" from their current record levels, and he reiterated his support for government spending on renewable energy sources and criticizing the oil and gas industry for not taking full advantage of drilling opportunities in the U.S. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES     
      President Biden announces a ban on Russian oil imports, toughening the toll on Russia's economy in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, Tuesday, March 8, 2022, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington. 
       (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Americans are experiencing the  highest gas prices  since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon – the highest average to date, according to  AAA . ""The decision today is not without cost here at home,"" Biden warned. ""Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders.""  ""And with this action, it's going to go up further,"" he continued. ""I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home in coordination with our partners.""  The Biden administration announced this week that it is releasing ""60 million barrels of oil from our joint-oil reserves,"" with Biden noting that half of that is ""coming from the United States.""  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A 'VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD' The president also maintained that his administration is taking steps to ensure the ""reliable supply of global energy,"" and is working with ""every tool in our disposal to protect American families and businesses."" ""We understand Putin’s war against the people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise — we get that,"" Biden said, directed at ""oil and gas companies and the finance firms that back them."" ""But it’s no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit this situation or American consumers,"" Biden said. ""Russia’s aggression is costing us all, and it’s no time for profiting or price gouging.""    Video He also acknowledged oil and gas companies ""that are pulling out of Russia and joining other businesses that are leading by example."" ""This is a time when we have to do our part and make sure we're not taking advantage,"" Biden said. Defending his administration, Biden said it is ""simply not true"" that his policies ""are holding back domestic energy production."" ""Even amid the pandemic, companies in the United States pumped more oil during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor’s first year,"" he said. ""We're approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United States and we’re on track to set a record of oil production next,"" he said, adding that in the U.S. ""90% of onshore oil production takes place on land that isn’t owned by the federal government.""    Video ""And the remaining 10% that occurs on federal land, the oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased — they have 9,000 permits to drill,"" he said. ""Now, they could be drilling right now. Yesterday, last week, last year, they have 9,000 [permits] to drill onshore that are already approved."" ""So let me be clear: they are not using them for production. That’s their decision,"" he said. ""These are the facts. We should be honest about the facts.""  But American Petroleum Institute CEO  Mike Sommers told FOX Business  on Monday that the White House ""certainly doesn't have their facts straight on this,"" adding that a lease is merely the first step in a process that includes investigating whether there is any oil or gas in the land. Biden has been facing criticism from Republicans, urging him to lift his executive orders that canceled the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and froze new oil and gas leases on federal lands. BIDEN TO BE GREETED IN TEXAS WITH NEAR-RECORD GAS PRICES Biden went on to say that this ""crisis"" is a ""stark reminder"" that, in order to ""protect our economy over the long term,"" the United States needs ""to become energy independent."" Biden noted that he has had ""numerous conversations"" with European allies over the last several months ""about how they have to wean themselves off Russian oil."" ""It’s just not tenable,"" he said. Biden added, though, that the crisis ""should motivate"" the United States to ""accelerate the transition to clean energy."" For American families, though, Biden admitted investments in clean energy ""will not lower energy prices for families,"" but said that transforming the economy to ""run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy with tax credits to help American families winterize their homes, and use less energy, that will help.""    Video ""If we do what we can, it will mean that no one has to worry about the price of gas in the future,"" Biden said. ""That will mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as weapons against other nations, and it will make America a world leader—manufacturing and exporting clean energy technologies of the future to countries all around the world.""  Biden added: ""This is the goal we should be racing toward."" Biden’s ban on Russian oil imports comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Monday, called for ""boycotts"" of Russian oil imports to the U.S. and European countries. ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, 'BOYCOTTS' OF RUSSIAN OIL ON DAY 12 OF INVASION Biden, during his speech from the White House Tuesday, said ""many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join"" the United States in the ban of Russian oil imports. ""The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of Europe and all the European countries combined,"" he said, adding that the U.S. is a ""net exporter of energy."" ""So, we can take this step when others cannot, but we are working closely with Europe and our partners to develop a long-term strategy to reduce their dependence on Russian energy as well."" Russia is the third-largest producer of oil in the world, but the impact to U.S. oil imports would be ""minimal"" compared to allies, administration officials told Fox News. ""Our teams are actively discussing how to make this happen, and today, we remain united. We remain united in our purpose to keep pressure mounting on Putin and his war machine,"" Biden said, noting that the step is one taken to ""inflict further pain on Putin."" Meanwhile, Biden touted the $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, saying that ""shipments of defensive weapons are arriving in Ukraine every day from the United States.""

There is a lot of effort to invest in capabilities and concepts to get us on a firmer footing to deal with the more modern nation-state-like threats and we’re doing it now. … We don’t have perfect visibility into Mr. Putin’s military planning but clearly, he wants to make a move on Kyiv. He’s actually approaching on three lines of major access in Ukraine. He has divided his forces. Coming up from the south, coming in from the northeast, and down towards the north towards Kyiv.

   EXCLUSIVE : The Republican Study Committee (RSC) Tuesday unveiled new legislation to block the United States from purchasing oil products from  Iran,  arguing the  Biden  administration needs to focus on boosting domestic energy supplies rather than funding terrorist regimes.  The legislation, called the ""No Oil From Terrorists Act,"" is especially timely as President Biden announced a ban on  Russian oil imports  to the U.S. on Tuesday amid bipartisan pressure as Russia continues its  invasion of Ukraine . Meanwhile, the United States is in active negotiations in Vienna to restart the Iran nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump pulled out of in 2018.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR LIVE UPDATES The GOP members of Congress want to prevent any circumstance in which the Biden administration tries to replace the Russian oil with new imports from Iran amid rising gas prices.

       ((Credit: Fox News)) ""When Joe Biden crushed the American energy industry on day one of his presidency, he left Americans dependent on our foreign adversaries for oil,"" said Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and chairman of the RSC. ""This sent gas prices through the roof and allowed Putin to fund his unprovoked war."" Banks continued: ""To add insult to injury, the Biden administration is now considering buying oil from Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. There is absolutely no reason to import terrorist’s oil when we can drill better, cheaper, and cleaner right here at home."" REPUBLICANS TROUBLED BY ONGOING TALKS TO REVIVE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: 'RUSSIA SHOULD NOT BE AT ANY TABLE' The United States isn't currently buying oil from Iran. The two largest exporters of crude oil and petroleum products to the U.S. are Canada and Mexico.  President Biden announced a ban on  Russian oil imports  Tuesday amid growing bipartisan pressure that the U.S. should not be sending any money to Russia that helps finance its brutal war against Ukraine.  But Biden pushed back hard on the notion that his policies are causing problems with domestic oil and gas production, noting that 90% of onshore oil production takes place on non-federal lands. He called the high gas prices: ""Putin's price hike."" ""It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,"" Biden said. ""That's simply not true. Even amid the pandemic, companies in the United States pump more oil during my first year in office, than they did during my predecessor's first year. We're approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United States.""

That's down from about 800,000 barrels in August.  BIDEN TO BE GREETED IN TEXAS WITH NEAR-RECORD GAS PRICES The White House was pressed Monday whether the Biden administration would be open to potential oil deals with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, as a way to stop the rising gas prices. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki however signaled that such talk of oil purchases was premature. But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said last week that "" all options are on the table "" during a discussion about oil prices after MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle asked if President Biden would consider ""working something out with Iran.""   Meanwhile, Americans are experiencing the  highest gas prices  since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon – the highest average to date, according to  AAA .

   A bipartisan group of lawmakers urged President Biden on Tuesday to work with NATO allies to provide Ukraine additional aircraft to ""defend and secure its skies,"" amid calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to create a  no-fly zone  over the country as Russia continues its invasion for a 13th day. The Biden administration has been weighing a deal with  Poland  to send U.S. warplanes to Warsaw to replace any Soviet-era fighter jets the NATO country sends to Ukraine. The U.S. has not yet signed off on the deal, over concerns it would be seen as an escalation, a source told Fox News.   RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES But on Tuesday, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., led a group of more than 50 lawmakers – both Democrats and Republicans – in encouraging the Biden administration to continue its negotiations with Poland to help in ""rapidly"" sending aircraft to Ukraine. ""We write today urging you to continue to work with our NATO allies to provide the Ukrainian Air Force with the additional aircraft needed to defend and secure its skies,"" they wrote. ""In light of reports that you are exploring the option of working with Poland to transfer Soviet-era aircraft to Ukraine, we want to express our support for this effort and encourage you to implement this policy without further delay, including by backfilling Poland’s aircraft supply to ensure their security.""

""We commend you for the support you have provided to Ukraine and the sanctions and measures implemented swiftly, in coordination with our allies and partners, in response to Russia’s aggression so far,"" they wrote, adding, though, that ""there is more work to do."" The lawmakers said Ukraine ""lost significant numbers of aircraft"" in the early days of the war, but said Ukrainian pilots ""have continued to courageously provide air support for ground troops and defend Ukrainian territory.""

""We have watched the Kremlin purposefully strike hospitals, schools and residential areas."" ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, 'BOYCOTTS' OF RUSSIAN OIL ON DAY 12 OF INVASION ""This is unacceptable,"" they added. The lawmakers continued by telling Biden they ""understand that imposing a no-fly zone in Ukraine at this time raises concern about a possible direct NATO confrontation with Russian forces, which President Putin could use as an excuse to further escalate the conflict."" ""That is why it is even more essential that we work with our NATO allies – including Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria – who are in possession of the Soviet-era jets familiar to the Ukrainian Air Force and that are essential assets for Ukrainians working to defend their sovereign territory,"" they wrote.

       (Tech. Sgt. Jacob Albers/U.S. Air Force via AP) Citing comments made by Secretary of State Antony Blinken from over the weekend, the lawmakers said the U.S. ""fully backed any member of NATO sending fighter planes to Ukraine."" Lawmakers noted that Poland has ""voiced concern about transferring these critical assets without backfill, which could degrade their own defensive capabilities and readiness as well as NATO’s overall."" ""In order to ensure NATO retains the necessary capabilities, we urge you to provide our NATO allies who transfer Soviet- era fighter jets to Ukraine other airframes, such as the F-16, to bolster their own defenses,"" they wrote, adding that by working to transfer aircraft to Ukraine ""swiftly,"" the U.S. and NATO allies ""can continue to demonstrate our staunch support for Ukraine’s democracy and sovereignty.""

Brad Wenstrup, Chris Stewart, Mike Turner, Brian Fitzpatrick, Andy Barr, Brian Mast, Burgess Owens and Mike Waltz. The letter comes after Zelenskyy, on Monday, again called for the West to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as Russia continues its unprovoked and brutal invasion of the country. Pleading with Western allies Monday, Zelenskyy asked: ""How many deaths and losses are still needed to secure the sky over Ukraine?"" ""What is the difference between peaceful people in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv and those in Hamburg and Vienna? We are awaiting the decision, clearing of the sky, either by the forces that you have or you give us the fighter planes of anti-aircraft defense that you have and that will provide the needed strength to us,"" he said. Zelenskyy said a no-fly zone is ""not just for Ukraine but for yourselves, too, in order to prove that humanity will win as fast as it can."" Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian government is ""already working on how to restore our country after the victory, how to provide strength to the country while we are fighting.""   Video Zelenskyy, on Sunday, also called for a no-fly zone, in a video message posted to Twitter bearing subtitles in English that stated: ""We repeat everyday: ‘Close the sky over Ukraine!’"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova espoused the same message on ""Fox News Sunday,"" in response to the Biden administration stating that it would not be imposing a no-fly zone. Markarova offered a reminder that Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked, and that if this could happen to Ukraine, it could happen to others. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""So if this situation, you know, happened to Ukraine, who is safe? What democracy can feel safe right now?"" Markarova wondered. ""So, I think, you know, the events of the past 11 days clearly shows that we have to act together and that Russia can attack anyone being totally unprovoked like they did with Ukraine. So it's time for all of us to step up."" Ukraine’s calls for a no-fly zone come as the Biden administration and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have made clear they are firmly against such a move, saying it would be viewed by Russia as an escalation – with some warning it could be the beginning of ""World War III."" Last week, the Biden administration ruled out setting up a no-fly zone for Russian aircraft over Ukraine, with senior defense officials saying enacting one would put the United States ""in the fight"" – as President Biden has maintained that U.S. military will not fight in Ukraine. UKRAINE URGES WORLD TO 'STEP UP,' IMPOSE NO-FLY ZONE, WHILE US LAWMAKERS WARN THIS WOULD MEAN 'WORLD WAR III' A no-fly zone is ""just not going to happen,"" the official added. NATO also rejected a Zelenskyy request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to provide air cover for the Ukrainian people. Zelenskyy slammed the decision, but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that having alliance planes over Ukrainian airspace could spark a new world war. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked all member countries will take action to assist. The Biden administration is requesting at least $10 billion in new money to provide aid to Ukraine amid Putin's war against the nation. The aid would go for additional humanitarian, security and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Officials of the Knights of Columbus in Poland are asking for financial and material support as they continue their efforts to aid refugees on both sides of the  Polish-Ukrainian border . The Polish branch of the Knights of Columbus has mobilized thousands of volunteers to provide food, shelter and protection for Ukrainian refugees fleeing to the Polish border as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues.  ""This is our charism to do this,"" said Knights of Columbus director Szymon Czyszek. Approximately $4.5 million from the United States, Poland and other KOC chapters around the world has been raised for the effort. POPE FRANCIS: UKRAINE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS 'GROWING DRAMATICALLY' AMID 'RIVER OF BLOOD AND TEARS' The KOC boast approximately 6,840 members in Poland, separated into 157 geographic councils. Ukraine has approximately 1,889 members split into 40 councils. The Polish branch was formed in 2006 at the request of St. Pope John Paul II, and the Ukrainian branch spun off in 2012. Czyszek called the proximity of the branches' founding to the outbreak of violence ""providential.""  Czyszek told the press that members of the organization have thus far not been met with violence or military aggression, but the safety of volunteers is an increasing concern.  Women were originally proposed as non-combatants that could bring aid over the border unobstructed, but the idea was quashed. Officials raised concerns about women entering the war zone alone, even as non-combatants. KOC has also begun erecting villages of ""Mercy Huts"" – small, protected enclaves of tents and temporary structures to house displaced Ukrainians. ""The Knights of Columbus are uniquely situated to help in Ukraine,"" Czyszek told Fox News last week in an interview. ""We have members and councils on both sides of the border, Poland and Ukraine. And we have found the ways to assist and bring humanitarian aid into Ukraine. Just days from the beginning of the war we were able to provide medical supplies, food, clothing and other necessities that are being distributed right now by our members in Ukraine.""     The KOC have been working alongside Catholic dioceses and archdioceses in Poland, as well as the Ukrainian Catholic Church to continue the rescue operation. Refugees are accepted and cared for without regard for religious affiliation, nationality or ethnicity.

   U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday that the nuclear threat from  Russia  is likely ""increasing"" as the invasion of  Ukraine  continues for a second week.   The assertion came Tuesday as the House Intelligence Committee convened a hearing on ""worldwide threats.""  In a line of questioning focused on nuclear threats, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, asked Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, CIA Director William Burns and U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Scott David Berrier each to evaluate how likely it would be for Russian President Vladimir Putin to activate his nuclear weapons if the United States and NATO allied forces engaged in the conflict in Ukraine. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTEL OFFICIALS PREDICT ‘UGLY’ WEEKS AHEAD AS PUTIN DOUBLES DOWN  ""Would it be correct to characterize that likely your assessment is that the threat is increasing?"" Turner asked. To that, Haines responded, ""that the threat is increasing, generally yes, I think that’s fair."" ""I absolutely agree that the threat is increasing,"" Burns said. ""I think our role is to try to provide insight from inside the intelligence community into the plans, the ambitions, the pace at which of adversaries – China or Russia – can move on these issues. It’s very important for us not to underestimate either the scope of those ambitions or the pace at which they can move. China and hypersonics is one example.""

Michael Pack , who oversaw VOA as the former CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, was warned of severe vetting concerns inside the department when he took over in the final year of the Trump administration, although he couldn't comment on the specifics of the González situation.     
      Michael Pack
       Shortly after he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June 2020 – his 2017 nomination by former President Trump was stalled for three years – Pack said the agency learned from the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of ""persistent security problems"" he said were left unaddressed by previous senior management. The USAGM learned that roughly 1,500 out of 4,000 employees had been improperly vetted and dozens of individuals – Pack estimated 77 to Fox News Digital – were wrongly given clearance levels of ""confidential"" and above that allowed them access to government system and facilities.  ""A lot of clearances were at different levels,"" he said, such as ""suitability clearances where it was a matter of them logging into the computers and having access to the buildings, so freelancers frequently had that level of clearance, because they have to log in, post their stories, exchange data …  It depends. It's clear they had an obligation with anyone working for them to make sure they had a certain level of security clearance. That's the whole point of working for the federal government."" The department later stated González, who has not been convicted of any crime, was not given any security clearance due to his freelance status. ""In short, as a matter of relevant federal rules, such background investigations are not available for freelancers (or any other contractors) who don't access federal IT systems or facilities,"" a spokesperson said. Pack, a conservative documentarian, said he didn't enter the position in 2020 expecting to tackle national security issues, but said bureaucrats at the other agencies were so alarmed that he was forced to act. One employee at the Office of Personnel Management ""told me it was the worst security issue she had seen in her many decades of working at OPM. That's why I was alerted to it,"" Pack said.

   FIRST ON FOX:  Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt is slamming Biden's Department of Justice (DOJ) for ending its ""China Initiative"" amid the  Russia-Ukraine war,  which he says projects weakness toward America's enemies. Schmitt, who is running in a crowded primary race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland Tuesday, warning that the Biden administration's decision to end the initiative is dangerous and detrimental to U.S. national security. ""The world is a dangerous place and liberty is not preserved with pandering and political correctness,"" Schmitt's letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital states. ""This decision by President Biden and his senior leadership projects weakness, emboldens our enemies, makes our country less safe and puts at risk the personal security of each and every American citizen."" Last month, DOJ announced that it is ending its "" China  Initiative"" program that was aimed at preventing spying by the Chinese Communist Party and launching a new, ""broader approach."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   The China Initiative was started in 2018 under the former Trump administration to protect U.S. national security against Chinese spying on U.S. intellectual property and in academia.

""[Top] leaders from the White House to senior military commanders continue to weaken our readiness by pandering to radical elements of the political left. Rather than training to meet and defeat our enemies these leaders push radical wokism and critical race theory,"" he stated, also pointing to the Biden administration's public list of threats and espionage efforts by the People's Republic of China (PRC). ""The PRC is motivated by a virulent communist ideology with its fundamental disregard for the rights of any individual. Add to this that the PRC is actively building up its military with increasingly advanced weapons systems. This, coupled with its nuclear capabilities, leaves no doubt that the PRC represents a threat that is like no other in the current geopolitical makeup of the world,"" says Schmitt.  He also points to China's aggressive posture toward the people in Taiwan.

       Schmitt also told Fox News Digital during an interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last week called it another ""wrong move"" in a series of recent mistakes on the part of DOJ. ""We need to view China for what it is: our biggest threat economically, militarily. And the DOJ's virtue signaling here is the wrong move. I mean, they've had a series of wrong moves, including, by the way, sticking the FBI on parents who show up to local school board meetings under the auspices of the PATRIOT Act.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   US intelligence officials in January assessed that Russia did ""not want a direct conflict with U.S. forces,"" but instead, sought ""U.S. recognition"" of its ""claimed sphere of influence"" over much of the former Soviet Union. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Tuesday released its 2022 annual threat assessment, which was submitted in early February. The assessment only includes intelligence through the end of January—weeks before Russia launched its multi-front war against Ukraine. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES The intelligence community's assessment states that Russia ""will remain an influential power and a formidable challenge to the United States amidst the changing geopolitical landscape during the next decade."" The IC assessed that Russia will continue to pursue its interests in ""competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways."" The IC, at the time, said Russia would press ""to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad,’ while exploring possibilities to achieve a more stable relationship with Washington.""

       (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) ""We assess that Russia does not want a direct conflict with U.S. Forces,"" the IC assessed in January. ""Russia seeks an accommodation with the United States on mutual noninterference in both countries’ domestic affairs and U.S. recognition of Russia’s claimed sphere of influence over much of the former Soviet Union."" The intelligence community explained that Russian officials have long believed that the United States is trying to undermine Russia, ""weaken"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, and ""install Western-friendly regimes in the former Soviet states and elsewhere,""—moves, the IC said, Russian officials ""conclude gives Russia leeway to retaliate.""   Video President Biden, in the weeks leading up to Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and in the thirteen days since Putin launched the war, has maintained that U.S. forces will not fight inside Ukraine against Russia. Instead, the United States has deployed thousands of troops to Eastern Europe with the intent of defending NATO allies. And while the Biden administration and its European allies and partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, the West has, so far, ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying enforcing one would put the U.S. and NATO in direct confrontation with Russia and would expand the conflict.

       (Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images) At the time of the assessment, Russia had not yet invaded Ukraine. The intelligence community, at the time said Russia was continuing to ""prepare for a military attack against Ukraine, with well over 100,000 troops massed near the Ukraine border, including Russian military forces in Belarus, occupied-Crimea, and the separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine."" The intelligence community assessed that Moscow would ""continue to employ an array of tools to advance its own interests or undermine the interests of the United States and its allies."" RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTEL OFFICIALS PREDICT 'UGLY' WEEKS AHEAD AS PUTIN DOUBLES DOWN ""These will be primarily military, security, and intelligence tools, with economic cooperation playing a smaller role,"" the IC stated. ""We expect Moscow to insert itself into crises when Russia’s interests are at stake, the anticipated costs of action are low, or it sees an opportunity to capitalize on a power vacuum."" The assessment added that Russia ""probably will continue to expand its global military, intelligence, security, commercial, and energy footprint and build partnerships aimed at undermining U.S. influence and boosting its own."" Meanwhile, the U.S. intelligence community assesses that Russia will remain ""the largest and most capable"" rival in weapons of mass destruction to the United States ""for the foreseeable future,"" as it ""expands and modernizes its nuclear weapons capabilities and increases the capabilities of its strategic and nonstrategic weapons.""   Video ""Russia also remains a nuclear-material security concern,"" the IC reported, noting that Russia ""views its nuclear capabilities as necessary for maintaining deterrence and achieving its goals in a potential conflict against the United States and NATO,"" and sees a ""credible nuclear weapons deterrent as the ultimate guarantor of the Russian Federation."" The intelligence community stated that Russia is continuing its development of long-range nuclear-capable missile and underwater delivery systems meant to ""penetrate or bypass U.S. missile defenses."" RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A 'VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD' ""Russia is expanding and modernizing its large, diverse, and modern set of nonstrategic systems, which are capable of delivering nuclear or conventional warheads,"" the report states, adding that Moscow believes such systems ""offer options to deter adversaries"" and ""control the escalation of potential hostilities."" The intelligence community also found that Russia believes the expansion and modernization of its nonstrategic systems could ""counter U.S. and allied troops near its border.""  The intelligence community also assessed that Russia would remain a ""top cyber threat"" in 2022, as it refines and employee its espionage, influence, and attack capabilities.

       (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) ""We assess that Russia views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy lever to shape other countries’ decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool,"" the report states. The intelligence community found that Russia is particularly focused on improving its ability ""to target critical infrastructure, including underwater cables and industrial control systems"" in the United States, as well as in U.S. allied and partner countries. The IC found that Russia’s successful compromise of that infrastructure would demonstrate Russia’s ""ability to damage infrastructure during a crisis."" The IC, at the time, said Russia is also using cyber operations to ""attack entities it sees as working to undermine its interests or threaten the stability of the Russian Government.""   Video ""Russia attempts to hack journalists and organizations worldwide that investigate Russian Government activity and in several instances, has leaked their information,"" the report states. This week, New York state said it is facing ""increased risk"" of cyberattacks from Russian retaliators, with NYPD officials warning that New York City is currently on ""ultra-high alert."" The IC also found that Russia presents ""one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States, using its intelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide Western alliances, and increase its sway around the world, while attempting to undermine U.S. global standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and influence U.S. voters and decision making."" ""We assess that Moscow probably will build on these approaches to try to undermine the United States as opportunities arise—Russia and its influence actors are adept at capitalizing on current events in the United States to push Moscow-friendly positions to Western audiences,"" the assessment states.

The annual threat assessment was released just after Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and other top U.S. intelligence officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee and warned that the coming weeks of Putin’s war will get ""ugly"" as he takes an even more aggressive approach to try to take over Ukraine. PUTIN'S DESIRE TO BRING BACK SOVIET UNION, ADVANCED AGE DRIVING INVASION, UKRAINE CAUCUS CO-CHAIR SAYS ""Our analysts assessed that Putin is unlikely to be deterred by such setbacks and instead may escalate, essentially doubling down to achieve Ukrainian disarmament neutrality to prevent it from further integrating with the U.S. and NATO if it doesn’t reach some diplomatic negotiation,"" Haines testified. Haines noted that while Putin may take a tougher stance now, he may be lowering his expectations in terms of possible outcomes as he sees more and more obstacles in his way.   Video ""What he might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time, given the significant costs he is incurring,"" Haines said. Meanwhile, the annual threat assessment was not just limited to Russia, but addressed other global threats facing the United States for 2022, including China, North Korea, Iran and more. ""In the coming year, the United States and its allies will face an increasingly complex and interconnected global security environment marked by the growing specter of great power competition and conflict, while collective, transnational threats to all nations and actors compete for our attention and finite resources,"" the intelligence assessment states.   Video The assessment states that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas—especially economically, militarily, and technologically—and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors."" And as many have said Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has emboldened China with regard to its ambition to take Taiwan, the intelligence community warned that Beijing is using a coordinated approach to compel neighbors to ""acquiesce"" to its preferences, ""including its territorial and maritime claims and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan."" ""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.– Taiwan engagement,"" the IC states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island, and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The assessment added that China’s ""control over Taiwan probably would disrupt global supply chains for semiconductor chips because Taiwan dominates production."" ""In the South China Sea, Beijing will continue to use growing numbers of air, naval, and maritime law enforcement platforms to intimidate rival claimants and signal that China has effective control over contested areas,"" the assessment states. ""China is similarly pressuring Japan over contested areas in the East China Sea."" The IC also assessed that China presents ""the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. Government and private sector networks."" ""China’s cyber pursuits and export of related technologies increase the threats of attacks against the U.S. homeland, suppression of U.S. web content that Beijing views as threatening to its control, and the expansion of technology-driven authoritarianism globally,"" the report states. The intelligence community also found that ""instability and conflicts continue to threaten U.S. persons and interests,"" some of which have ""direct implications for U.S. security."" ""For example, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan threatens U.S. interests, including the possibility of terrorist safe havens re-emerging and a humanitarian disaster,"" the assessment states.

Special Court for Sierra Leone said. ""We have to show tyrants around the world that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun."" The international prosecutor's comments come as  concerns have mounted  that China could be looking to see how the international community may react if it decides to invade Taiwan. Crane argued the U.S. needs to act as a leader in the global sphere and hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable. He pointed to various paths the international community could take, including through the establishment of war tribunals similar to those that followed WWII. ""It must be noted that the United States has led the creation of all of the international tribunals and courts in the modern era — from Nuremberg and Tokyo, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the International Criminal Court and various domestic efforts and mechanisms around the world as well,"" Crane said.  ""The United States must continue to show leadership in the creation of justice mechanisms to hold Vladimir Putin and his henchmen accountable."" Crane was joined by former Deputy to the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, Jane Stromseth, and Managing Director of Global Policy at the George W. Bush Institute, David Kramer, who also gave similar testimony.

""The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the Polish Foreign Ministry  said in a statement  Tuesday. ""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities.

Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday that the announcement was ""a surprise move by the Poles."" ""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" she said. ""But as you know, we have been having consultations with them for a couple of days now about this request from the Ukrainians to receive their aircraft, and were they to donate them, whether we would be able to support backfill in their own security needs."" Earlier Tuesday, a  bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers  sent a letter to President Biden urging him to support a deal with Poland. But Pentagon press secretary John Kirby  distanced the U.S. from the proposal  later in the day, saying that while the decision to hand over jets to Ukraine is in the hands of the Polish government, American involvement ""raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance."" ""It is simply not clear to us that there is substantive rationale for it,"" he said in a statement. ""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""  He said the U.S. would continue talks with Poland and the rest of NATO regarding the issue. Ukrainian pilots have been trained on the Soviet-era MiG jets. Poland, which joined NATO in 1999, aimed to replace the donated MiGs with used F-16s.

   On Tuesday,  President Biden  announced new efforts to  ban Russian oil imports  following  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . Unfortunately, many Americans are expected to face even higher gas prices for these sanctions. Ahead of Republican criticism, many media outlets preemptively attacked Republicans for exploiting the issue.  Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell explained in an op-ed that ""Republicans are laying a trap for Biden on Russian energy sanctions."" She went on to accuse Republicans of ""exploiting the economic pain"" of Americans to attack Biden. DAVID ASMAN FACT-CHECKS BIDEN ON RISING OIL AND GAS PRICES: IT’S ‘JUST INCORRECT’       
      Washington Post- Republicans are laying a trap for Biden on Russian energy sanctions
       (Fox News) ""Abruptly cutting Russia off from global energy markets would be painful for more than just the Russians. It could lead to a recession. It may nonetheless be the right thing to do — but we should all be clear-eyed about likely consequences,"" Rampell wrote ""And if Republicans truly believe our patriotic duty is to orchestrate a Western embargo of Russian energy, they should commit, today, to not politically exploiting the economic pain such sanctions will inevitably cause American consumers."" While many Republicans and  Democrats  called for Biden to ban Russian oil since the start of the Ukraine invasion, many have also called on Biden to increase domestic oil drilling to offset the supply. Rampell referred to this idea as ""a fantasy — one born either of confusion about how energy markets work or a cynical desire to set up Biden."" Other members of the media similarly accused Republicans of attempting to use the economic issues to attack Biden. NBC reporters Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong covered the news of the sanctions  writing , ""Republicans cheer Russian oil ban and jeer Biden for rising gas prices.""  ""GOP leaders — eager to win back the House and Senate this fall — are trying to capitalize by blaming Biden and his energy policies for Americans paying more at the pump,"" Kapur and Wong wrote. They also dismissed calls for increased domestic drilling.

       (Getty Images) Politico ’s coverage focused on Republican backlash against inevitable gas price increases. ""Nearly all Republicans agree on a ban, too. But they have also used the topic to criticize Biden for limiting domestic oil and gas production that they argue can fill the gap created by a Russian import ban,"" Politico wrote. White the White House and several liberal defenders have claimed that there are 9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used by oil companies to gouge prices, experts have called this a "" red herring ."" ""Once you lease land there is a whole process that you have to go through. First you have to actually discover whether actually there is oil and gas in that land. Second of all, you have to get a permit to actually develop that land,"" American Petroleum Institute (API) president and CEO Mike Sommers told FOX Business.     
      FILE PHOTO: Pump jacks operate in front of a drilling rig in an oil field in Midland, Texas U.S. August 22, 2018. 
       (Reuters/Nick Oxford) On Twitter, several reporters and pundits attacked Republicans for criticizing Biden's energy policies.  New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser tweeted ""so it begins--Republicans demand ban on Russian oil, complain about high oil prices and blame Democrats for them."" MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle wrote ""Next phase to watch from Republicans: - many pushed for Russian oil ban. Will they work with WH to find way to pump more fast and ease economic burden on consumers? OR cheer on higher prices / blaming Biden for inflation?"" CNN's John Harwood responded ""yes"" to a tweet reading ""So Republicans in Congress are pushing to ban Russian oil and gas imports—and to push Europe to do the same—which would send gas prices skyrocketing, which Republicans would then hang around Democrats’ necks in the midterms, am I reading that right?"" LAID-OFF KEYSTONE PIPELINE WORKER WARNS US IN ‘DEEP TROUBLE; WITH BIDEN ENRGY POLICIES Since taking office, President Biden has also enacted  several executive orders  and legislation that have discouraged or halted increased oil drilling in the United States. After his inauguration, he signed orders to  ban new permits  for oil and gas drilling and fracking on federal lands and waters for one year. Other orders included  eliminating fossil fuel subsidies  and revoking federal permits for the  Keystone XL Pipeline . Biden also drew further criticism for reportedly courting  Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Iran  for new oil deals rather than increase domestic drilling.

""Russia is trying to up the ante and broaden its demands with regard to the (nuclear deal) and we are not playing 'Let's make a deal',"" Nuland, the No. 3 U.S. diplomat, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Iran's top negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani is due back in Vienna on Wednesday after unexpectedly returning to Tehran on Monday for  consultations , an Iranian and a European official said. The talks' coordinator, Enrique Mora of the European Union, said on Monday the time had come for political decisions to be taken to end the negotiations. ""The window of opportunity is closing. We call on all sides to make the decisions necessary to close this deal now, and on Russia not to add extraneous conditions to its conclusion,"" Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement to the U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors. Iran has  sought to remove all sanctions  and it wants guarantees from the United States that it will not abandon the agreement once more, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump walked out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. Diplomats have said until now that several differences still needed to be overcome in the talks, including the extent to which sanctions on Iran, notably its elite revolutionary guards, would be rolled back and what guarantees Washington would give if it were to again renege on the deal.

While they couldn't rule out further last-minute surprises, they said the last big open question was whether Russia's demands were manageably narrow and limited to nuclear cooperation spelled out in the agreement, as Moscow's envoy to the talks has told other parties, or much broader, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has described them. RUSSIA TIES POSSIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL REVIVAL TO UKRAINE SANCTIONS ""We are very close to an agreement. It is essential we conclude while we still can,"" France's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters in a daily briefing. ""We are concerned by the risks that further delays could weigh on the possibility of concluding,"" she said. COMMON INTEREST Moscow threw the potential wrench in the works on Saturday, just as months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna appeared to be headed for an agreement, with Lavrov saying the Western sanctions over Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the nuclear deal. The EU's Mora and Russia's top negotiator Mikhail Ulyanov held talks in Vienna on Tuesday evening, exchanging views on the ""current developments and way ahead,"" Moscow's envoy said on Twitter. Western officials say there is common interest in avoiding a nuclear nonproliferation crisis, and they are trying to ascertain whether what Russia is demanding regards only its commitments to the Iran deal. That would be manageable, but anything beyond that would be problematic, they say. The new agreement would lead to Russia taking in excess highly enriched uranium that would be taken out of Iran to bring Tehran back into compliance with the original deal's caps on the purity and amount of the enriched uranium it is stockpiling.

       (Reuters) Rosatom, a state-run company formed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007, is key to that and has still not been added to Western sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken played down the issue during a visit to Estonia on Tuesday and said Russia and the United States still shared a desire to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go and it was now up to the two main protagonists to agree on outstanding issues.

   Former Hawaii Congresswoman  Tulsi Gabbard  voiced concern Tuesday on "" The Ingragam Angle "" about the Biden administration's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. TULSI GABBARD: When I look at these issues, I think about what is in the best interests of the American people, is what we're doing going to be good for the American people or not. And clearly this continued escalation of this conflict and this war is not in the best interests of the American people or the world, frankly, which is why Zelinskyy's statement last night on ABC News, for the first time that I'm aware of, opening the door, a window of opportunity where he's open to the fact of saying, hey, yeah, maybe we'll set this NATO membership thing aside, and he's willing to talk with Putin directly to negotiate the outcome or the status of these disputed territories really extending an olive branch. … Nothing that the Biden administration has done has helped to make this situation better has helped to deescalate the situation, which is why the only conclusion that I can draw about why they have been completely silent and not engaging at all on this window of opportunity that President Zelenskyy opened last night, is that what is happening before our eyes right now is exactly what they want to see continue. Why is that? Because it's good for the military industrial complex. It makes these politicians look tough and really, you know, it allows them to have this proxy war with Russia, something that Hillary Clinton laid out just recently. Really, what their aims are this war machine, this power elite in Washington is they want to turn Ukraine into another Afghanistan turn into killing fields where this long term insurgency is supported, and they bleed out and cripple, kill as many Russians as possible for who knows, who knows how long, and they're really showing their real aim in the fact that they're not taking action right now to end this conflict.

In this case, I just want to say one additional thing on the on the Stingers. … They didn't get them soon enough. They've been begging for them for months. We were briefed in the Armed Services Committee that the United States couldn't send them stingers because we didn't have the type of variant that had some classified technology on it. Therefore, we couldn't give it to them. Now here we are, eight weeks later, finally giving it to him. You know what the problem was? Three screws to take a part off. That's what it took the administration months to figure out. And imagine if the Ukrainians had had those stingers on the rooftops on day one.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   You may have noticed that Joe Biden announced today a new front in his ongoing war against America's middle class. Biden didn't frame it that way, of course, Democrats rarely say what they mean. They tell you it's about something else.  In this case,  Biden  told us it was about Vladimir Putin. Biden explained that we're going to hurt Putin by making it illegal for Americans to buy Russian energy. This, he said, will amount to a massive moral victory for us. We're going to feel great about ourselves. And at the same time, it will be a crushing defeat for the Russians who of course, deserve it.   So, it's one of those rare occasions when we could see the good guys win and the bad guys lose. Hurray. Around Washington, you could almost hear the feverish applause as Biden finished speaking. Every constituency loved it. The media agreed that Joe Biden had never seemed more presidential. Democratic officials seemed deeply relieved. For once, they could talk about something other than COVID and the southern border. They'd rather be on offense than defense.   DUAL RUSSIAN-U.S. CITIZEN CHARGED WITH ACTING AS KREMLIN SPY: DOJ       
      President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.
       (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Republican leaders, meanwhile, seemed happiest of all. They barked like seals. Finally, a chance to sound tough and decisive without making CNN angry. Thank you, Joe Biden. We can all be John McCain now. You rarely see unity like this in a city as divided as Washington. The unity was so heady, in fact so delightful and intoxicating, that no one remembered to ask the most basic question: Why exactly are we doing this? What's the point? Is the point to bankrupt Vladimir Putin? That might be worth doing, but this won't do it.   Putin  already has ready markets around the world for his oil, starting in China, in India and Turkey. So that's not going to work. Maybe the point is to force Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraine. That would definitely be worth doing, but no, that's not the point, either. Joe Biden will typically say absolutely anything, but even Joe Biden didn't claim today that sanctioning Russian oil will end the war in Ukraine because it won't.   So, who exactly are these sanctions aimed at? Think about it. If you want to identify the target of a penalty, consider who's going to suffer most from it. And in this case, the answer could not be clear. It's middle-income Americans. They're the ones who were crushed for two years under COVID restrictions. They're the ones who are about to be pummeled by shutting down more energy sources. Notice a theme here? The people in charge hate the middle class above all. So, it's not Vladimir Putin who's getting punished, it's American citizens. It's you. It's not speculation.   Gas prices are already the highest they have ever been in history and they're about to get even higher—potentially much, much higher. So will the price of natural gas and the price of electricity and food and everything else you buy that has to be transported more than 100 yards from where it was made, which is to say every single thing in your life. This is not good news for you, no matter what Washington is currently claiming. You are about to get a lot poorer. That's guaranteed. You'll notice as you read this that is the one thing that somehow Joe Biden forgot to mention today.   PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Today, I'm announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy. We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine. … It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That's simply not true.   So, lying by omission is pretty simple. You just don't mention the truth. You heard Biden do that just there, but it takes something else very different—whether it's chutzpah, delusion or senility or whatever else, explains Joe Biden's behavior - It takes something like that to tell a lie like the one you just read at the end of Biden's statement, ""It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production.""     FORMER UKRAINE FIRST LADY: PUTIN’S HATRED FOR THE US DRIVES HIS POLICY   Video Oh, but it simply is true. It's demonstrably true and everyone knows it. On his first day in office, Biden single-handedly killed the Keystone XL Pipeline. Then, just days before  Russia  invaded Ukraine, weirdly, Biden's administration shut down all new energy leases and permits on federal land. That happened. Vladimir Putin did not do that. Joe Biden did it. Biden's publicist tried to explain that actually preventing domestic energy production, which they have done, is very different from holding back domestic energy production.   PRESS SECRETARY JEN PSAKI: Let me give you the facts here and I know that can be inconvenient, but I think they're important in this moment. To the contrary, we have...been clear that in the short term, supply must keep up with the demand where we are at, here and around the world, while we make the shift to a secure, clean energy future. We are one of the largest producers with a strong domestic oil and gas industry. We have actually produced more oil. It is at record numbers, and we will continue to produce more oil. There are 9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used. So, the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate. The suggestion that that is what is hindering or preventing gas prices to come down is inaccurate.   GAS PRICES: CALIFORNIA HAS HIGHEST PRICES, OKLAHOMA HAS LOWEST ""Let me give you the facts here."" Now, when they say that, you know the lies are coming and indeed, in this case, they arrived promptly. Because oil companies have not used all the permits they've received, Jen Psaki told us, that means this is their fault. They're not trying hard enough to produce energy. They could, but they don't want to. But wait a second, Jen Psaki. What if there's no oil or gas underneath the permitted land? In that case, energy producers would want permits for land where the energy is. Turns out they don't want dry wells. They want wells that flow, but they're not getting them thanks to the Green New Deal lobby that completely controls this administration, they can't get those permits. And that's what's happening here and if you doubt it, ask anyone who works in the energy business.       
      Russian President Vladimir Putin 
       (Photo by Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images) Jen Psaki just lied to you. They are all lying to you. You probably guessed that already, but you can't say it because if you wonder what these policies may be doing to your country or to your family, you are selfish and disloyal. In fact, you're unpatriotic because real patriotism is caring about Ukraine first. And by the way, caring about Ukraine means prolonging a bloody war on Ukraine until the entire country of Ukraine has been destroyed and millions of Ukrainians are refugees.   We know we can do because we did it in Iraq. We can do it in Ukraine. That's patriotism. Once you spell it out, it all sounds kind of complicated, so we're going to hand it over to our late-night moral leader Stephen Colbert to explain:   STEPHEN COLBERT: Today, the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high of over $4 per gallon. OK, that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. I'm willing to pay. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon, hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla.   RUSSIAN PRISONERS OF WAR WILL WORK TO ‘RESTORE’ UKRAINE’S ECONOMY: UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS       
      A Late Show with Stephen Colbert during Sunday's February 7, 2021 Super Bowl Special.
       (Photo by Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images) Well, it turns out a guy who makes $16 million a year is willing to pay a little more for gas if that's the right thing to do. He's willing to make that sacrifice, because that's the kind of caring, decent man Stephen Colbert is. Now it's true, as you just heard, that he doesn't actually use gasoline. He drives a $150,000 electric car, but he will do it anyway. He's the kind of man who will take you out to dinner and let you pay, and at the end, he'll let you leave a big tip because he cares about the server.   Sometimes, as Stephen Colbert reminds us, life is about making tough moral choices and that's especially true now. If at the end of this project, this protracted exercise and social reorganization achieved through COVID plus a war with Russia, if at that point, whenever it is, we no longer have a self-sufficient middle class, if people who make under $100,000 a year are more desperate and demoralized and dependent on government than they've ever been, if the only Americans who remain truly free at that point are the oligarchs, well, at least we can say we helped democracy.   When Mark Zuckerberg controls everything in America, you will know it's a truly democratic system. Justin Trudeau understands this. He ran over members of his middle class with horses because that's what it took to preserve democracy in Canada. And then he went further. He seized truckers’ bank accounts and then he shut down a coffee shop that serves people who didn't vote for him. That's what democracy looks like.  Elizabeth Warren was excited when she saw this kind of democracy at work. Warren knows that if we're going to preserve democracy in America, if we're going to fight Russia, then Elizabeth Warren is going to need fingertip control of your family's finances now and always. And by the way, don't try and hide anything from Elizabeth Warren, say, in cryptocurrency, because if you do, Elizabeth Warren will know you are working for Vladimir Putin.   SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN: As I mentioned earlier, we're going after two things: trying to squeeze the Russian economy and also trying to squeeze those oligarchs, right. The problem is we're doing that only through the formal banking system and we're doing a good job on that and that is very effective. It's historic. I'm 100% behind it. But, there's a hole in the dike here and the hole is crypto. In other words, you got to pick it, crypto. If you want to continue to trade and provide the trading platforms and so on in the wallets, you can do business in Russia or you can do business in the United States, but you can't do business in both.   Here's an idea: Let's keep dumb people and crazed partisan demagogues away from our financial system and our power grid. They can keep the sociology department. Have fun. But why don't you stay away from the fundamentals that keep the country running? How's that sound? That was the arrangement for decades, but no longer. You must submit to total personal control by irresponsible lunatics like Elizabeth Warren or you can serve Russia, as she put it, ""you can't do business in both."" And by the way, you better not complain about this. Good Americans love higher gas prices. They love suffering for a cause they don't understand. CNN looked into it and that's what they found.  CNN CORRESPONDENT: People we've spoken to over the last couple of weeks, they're OK paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for what they are doing in Ukraine, but these prices are likely going to creep higher.   GIGI HADID CRITICIZED FOR COMPARING UKRAINE AND PALESTINIAN CONFLICTS: ‘ABSOLUTELY APPALLED’

       (Photo by ALEXEI NIKOLSKY/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images) It turns out Americans are delighted to be poor and helpless. They love it because poverty means holding Russia accountable, not Putin's poverty, that's not going to happen, your poverty.  Well, how exactly does your poverty hold Putin accountable? CNN didn't ask that question, but the polling company Rasmussen did ask. That's what they do. They asked this question, ""If a wider war breaks out in Europe, should the US military be involved?"" Pretty simple question.  The answer was not simple, though. The answer varied by income. This may not surprise you. The people who actually fight our wars, the people making under $30,000 a year were overwhelmingly opposed to this war. Only 37% of them supported military action, and then it changed going up.   CBS PARROTS BIDEN'S DEFENSE ON HIGH GAS PRICES: HIS POLICIES ‘NOT HURTING OIL PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY’ The richer and more cut off from physical reality people got, the more ardently they supported war with Russia, and it turns out that's the subset you see. Those are the people on television, the people with fake jobs and inherited money. They're totally for it, and they’re for it because they are going to pay no cost, but they'll still get to feel virtuous about promoting it. Then they'll tune in to Stephen Colbert at night with a clean heart. As for the Americans who will do the actual fighting and then the suffering here at home, they don't count. Because in a democracy you can safely ignore the middle class and so our leaders are doing that.  REP. STEVE COHEN:  But the truth is, we should be thinking about the fact that when Americans go to fill up their cars that they should think about sticking it to Putin when they put that gas handle in your gas tank, it's going to cost a little more and part of it's going to be because of Russia and just stick it to Putin.  REP. ADAM SMITH: Now, here in America, we got to be ready for the fact that will drive up oil prices, that will drive up gas prices and if we are really standing with Ukraine, we have to be prepared to absorb that.  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Just ban all Russian imports into the United States in terms of oil and gas. Four percent of our oil supply comes from Russia. We can easily make that up. So, what we haven't done yet is go after the oil and gas sector in Russia. That's the Achilles heel to Putin's war machine.   They don't care about you at all. They have complete contempt for you and your interests. Notice, they don't even bother to apologize to you for what they're about to do to you and your family, which will change your life.

       (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) It's hard to remember a betrayal at this scale and yes, we have been here before, by the way, we've been in conflicts with Russia for a long time. The United States traded with the Russians through the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union and United States had nuclear weapons pointed right at each other and we worried one might go off. We traded with Joseph Stalin in the middle of his terror at the very moment he was murdering four million, yes, Ukrainians. That happened. And then we armed Stalin.  We armed the Soviet Army as he was killing Ukrainians and the New York Times endorsed all of it. But now, because Putin invaded Ukraine, effectively encouraged by the Biden administration to do that, which is true, because that happened, we are going to send billions of dollars to the Saudi theocracy and then to the Iranians and then to Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and at the same time, we're going to embrace green energy, which means giving the government of  China  complete control over a power grid here in America. That's our plan. Are you confused by it? Don't be. It's a moral victory.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   With the  Russian invasion of Ukraine , we have witnessed the invasion of a free and sovereign nation by a reckless dictator who cares little for peace or the sovereignty of his neighbors. This attack did not happen in a vacuum; it was the direct result of weak American leadership and a lack of American resolve.   For months, we knew that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine. We saw its troops massed on the Ukrainian border, knew they were conducting military exercises with the intent to invade, and knew that usurping Ukraine had been  Vladimir Putin’s objective  for decades. Yet, all the Biden administration could muster to deter this imminent attack was a weak, vague threat of sanctions and ambiguous statements that implied a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine would be permissible.     Video American deterrence in Ukraine failed because  the Biden administration  placed too much emphasis on the threat of sanctions without establishing that it possessed the resolve to impose costs on its adversaries.    US IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO PREPARE FOR A RUSSIAN CYBER ATTACK In Afghanistan, we fled without hitting back at the Taliban as it violated its deals and threatened American lives. Team Biden couldn’t even manage to impose real costs after the Taliban killed 13 U.S. troops in a cowardly attack of terror. The Biden administration’s weakness on full display to our adversaries invited this attack.   The invasion of Ukraine necessitates clarifying our position on Taiwan’s sovereignty so that President Xi Jinping fully understands unambiguously our relationship to Taiwan. Since its very inception, the Chinese Communist Party has sought to bring Taiwan under its control, and this ambition has only grown stronger in recent years.      Video Taiwan’s free economy is among the most prosperous in the world. It is one of the few countries that has experienced continuous economic growth during the past five years, and last year, it experienced its strongest economic growth in a decade. Practically every electronic device in the world – from smartphones to the computer chips in our own Air Force’s F-35 fighter jets – contains essential parts that are manufactured only in Taiwan, by Taiwanese companies. This makes the island democracy an immensely important strategic objective.   If the CCP could take Taiwan by force, it would also likely gain command over the market for advanced chip manufacturing for the global market. That control would be catastrophic for America and our allies. Likewise, ensuring that Taiwan’s economy remains free and out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party is crucial to future prosperity in America and throughout the world.  The Russian invasion was the result of weak leadership in America and the West.   Also central to the CCP’s mission to take Taiwan back is its recognition that a democratic Chinese nation represents a clear contradiction to its own avowed supremacy. The Chinese people, like all people, do not want the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party. And every day Taiwan exists as a free and independent nation, that clear contradiction to their assertion of power grows stronger.    For these reasons, the CCP’s goal is to ""reunify"" Taiwan with mainland China, by force if necessary – just as Putin’s stated goal was to bring Ukraine back under the influence of Russia, as was the case in the days of the Soviet Union.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When our adversaries make their intentions clear, we should take them seriously and not waste time in taking the necessary steps to deter them. Recognizing free and sovereign countries and preventing tyrannical despots from overrunning them should also be a goal around which the world can unite with strong leadership from the United States.        Video The Russian invasion was the result of weak leadership in America and the West, as well as our collective lack of resolve in the face of clear, unmistakable Russian aggression since the Biden administration took charge a little over a year ago. A failure to learn from these mistakes will result in a conflict far more catastrophic for America and its allies: an attack on Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China. We should send a strong message to President Xi now by recognizing Taiwan as a free and sovereign country.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The PRC regards actions that are not in accordance with the dictums of the Chinese Communist Party, such as standing against genocide in Xinjiang and supporting the right of the Taiwanese people to determine their own future, as ""provocative."" But it is never provocative to say that one demands freedom.    The United States should immediately take necessary and long-overdue steps to do the right and obvious thing: to recognize that Taiwan is a free and independent nation. We must offer Taiwan full diplomatic recognition and cement our ironclad relationship. In so doing, we will send a clear and unmistakable message to the Chinese Communist Party that what has happened in Ukraine, will never be permitted to happen in Taiwan.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MIKE POMPEO  ",2022-03

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The  war  in Ukraine since Russia President Vladimir Putin's invasion has sparked some controversial analysis in the liberal media. Ukrainians have taken up arms to defend their homeland as Russian troops continue to advance toward the capital, Kyiv. The invasion has claimed over 1,000 civilian casualties so far, according to the United Nations, while over 1 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries. While the war has united those of all political stripes in feeling compassion for the plight of the Ukrainian people, progressive pundits have uttered some partisan analysis of the fighting in recent days. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Race-based analysis MSNBC host Joy Reid claimed Monday that the war in Ukraine was getting so much attention due to demographics. ""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their Browner and Blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,"" Reid said on ""The ReidOut.""

MSNBC'S JOY REID: WORLD PAYING ATTENTION TO UKRAINE BECAUSE IT'S A ‘WHITE…CHRISTIAN NATION’ Voter suppression claims Several media pundits tried to tie the conflict in Ukraine to domestic matters. A few took swipes at  President Biden , for instance, for failing to make a connection between the fight for freedom in Ukraine to voting rights efforts in the U.S. during his State of the Union address. ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd and his guest, author and Princeton University professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr., agreed that Biden  missed an opportunity  to mention the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in his remarks on Ukraine. Bloody Sunday occurred on March 7, 1965, when unarmed civil rights protesters were met with violent resistance from local law enforcement during a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, for voting rights. Todd said he was ""surprised"" by Biden's apparent whiff, while Glaude said he was ""stunned."" ""If there's one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union, it was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad with the fight for democracy and freedom at home. Today's Bloody Sunday,"" Todd said. ""I was stunned,"" Glaude said. ""I mean, it was an easy kind of rhetorical move: Let's defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home.""      
      Liberal pundits weren’t happy when President Biden failed to connect domestic issues to Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

I'm willing to pay $4 dollars a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla,"" Colbert  said .

""He also made it clear, Weijia, that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country.

""Right, because that’s what Republicans have been saying very forcefully. Wondering why we can’t just ramp up oil production here. Well, the President just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they aren’t taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said that’s exactly right,"" Jiang agreed. Blaming Trump Other media figures like ""The View's"" Whoopi Goldberg and CNN's John Harwood chose to blame former  President Trump  for the current chaos or suggest the situation would have had been even more perilous if he was still commander in chief. ""If bonehead had been president, and I say what I said last time, there wouldn’t have been any issue because that guy would have handed Ukraine over to the Russians,"" Goldberg  claimed  Monday. ""When you hear Republican politicians snipe at Biden on the crisis, Remember: the Republican president who left office last year used his term to strengthen Russia's hand and weaken Ukraine's, his party protected him as he did it, he still leads the party,"" Harwood tweeted of Trump.

""Do these foreign policy ‘experts’ even understand what it means to impose a no-fly zone?""     
      
       (Google Earth) WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US IMPOSED A NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE? Russian President Vladimir Putin could consider a no-fly zone declaration to be ""escalatory, not de-escalatory,"" Koffler added. She suggested it could steer Putin toward nuclear engagement. 
 If the ""experts"" believe a no-fly zone will make Putin stand down, they are dumb. If they are running a PSYOP on Putin, it will have the opposite effect. Putin doesn't think like an American. He thinks like a Russian. P will interpret the move as escalatory, not de-escalatory. — Rebekah Irina Koffler (@rebekah0132)  March 9, 2022

""We, the undersigned, urge the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to impose a limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on Thursday,"" stated the letter, which Farkas and others signed.

Jorge Alberto Fernández, a tourist, was accused of terrorism because he brought a drone into Venezuela, according to Reuters. Last weekend marked the highest-level visit from U.S. officials to the country in years. In 2019, the Trump administration banned Venezuelan oil imports over allegations by the West that authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro had conducted an illegitimate election.  The prisoner release came on the same day  President Biden  said the U.S. plans to ban imports of Russian oil, natural gas, and coal. Venezuelan oil could help offset the loss of Russian imports but U.S. officials said the release of the Americans was not part of any deal, but rather an apparent goodwill gesture.

Just like  energy , food touches everything and is something everyone needs to survive. The unfortunate reality, however, is the food sector is already being extremely disrupted by Putin’s war on Ukraine. Just this week the UN Global Food and Agriculture Organization reported global food prices have hit an all-time high.   The unfortunate reality, however, is the food sector is already being extremely disrupted by Putin’s war on Ukraine.    As we move into the spring planting season – if we effectively address our current supply chain, regulatory, and inflation challenges – producers in the United States are in a strong position to help alleviate potentially devastating shortages and ensuing hunger around the world. For American farmers to be able to do what they do best – feed, fuel, and fiber the globe – the American government must do its part by focusing on alleviating supply chain challenges, which will go a long way in decreasing input costs and getting food to consumers around the world.    Video According to the February ""Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer,"" 30% of crop producers in the United States expressed some difficulty purchasing 2022 crop inputs from suppliers. The survey also underscores farmers’ concerns with inflation, highlighting higher input costs as their number one concern for the last six months. Take fertilizer for example: Many farmers are easily spending triple to fertilize their land, and fertilizer prices could soar even higher as the situation in Ukraine worsens. COLIN REED: BIDEN'S FAILURES BY THE NUMBERS - THE ENERGY COSTS, POLL NUMBERS TELL THE STORY One of Congress’s top priorities to ease the pressure being felt by the agricultural community should be to address the delays and bottlenecks which are making it difficult to get the supplies needed for planting season. Similarly, these supply chain disruptions also cause uncertainty on where and how agricultural goods can be moved efficiently to consumers.

These bottlenecks and delays are disproportionately impacting agricultural exports as foreign ocean carriers are leaving ports completely empty rather than shipping American food to our global markets. Last week the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on legislation passed by the House of Representatives, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. This bill, cosponsored by both of us, would update federal regulations for the global ocean shipping industry and make it more difficult for ocean carriers to refuse service to American exporters.

   War is hell, and the fighting in  Ukraine  is only going to get worse in the days ahead. Barring sudden breakthroughs in negotiations between the  Putin  and Zelenskyy governments for a cease-fire, casualties will rise rapidly on both sides as the conflict enters a phase of urban sieges with more indiscriminate shelling and higher civilian casualties. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES Slowing – or perhaps even stalemating – the  Russian  war machine is a matter of extreme urgency. As Russian forces target population centers, a war of attrition will ensue as they attempt to inflict escalated destruction. Putin will want this carnage to break the back of the resistance and create leverage for concessions, including a guarantee that Ukraine remain a neutral state, reduce its armed forces to a level acceptable to Russia, and promise it will never join NATO. What is the U.S. role in all this? The stakes of getting it right could not be higher. Russian military doctrine does integrate the use of tactical nuclear weapons into conventional campaigns, which needs to be considered in the Western calculus to prevent a nuclear confrontation.   Video Assuming that the  Biden  administration holds to it s  promises that no American troops will be deployed and a no-fly zone is off the table, the primary means by which America and its NATO allies can assist the Ukrainians is direct military aid. That means an enhanced flow of weapons, logistics assistance, and intelligence support. RUSSIA 'DOES NOT WANT A DIRECT CONFLICT WITH US FORCES,' INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ASSESSED IN JANUARY Lessons from past conflicts provide a roadmap here. The United States fought a 20-year counterinsurgency in  Afghanistan , slightly less than that in  Iraq .  The former Soviet Union could stomach a decade in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. Both superpowers learned – the hard way – that expeditionary counterinsurgency is messy and difficult, even more so if the insurgency is supplied with weapons, training, and intelligence from abroad. Russia and Ukraine are locked in a contest of wills.    What changed the tide of war for the Soviets in Afghanistan? The U.S. supplied Stinger missiles. What changed the tide of war for the United States in Iraq?  The IED, or improvised explosive device, more specifically the EFP – explosively formed penetrators - supplied by Iran. What did the Stinger in the hands of the mujahideen and EFPs in the hands of Iraqi insurgents have in common? They were both tactical weapons that achieved levels of strategic importance that allowed less technologically capable forces to defeat superpowers. Those very same weapons can be employed against Russian forces in Ukraine.       
      A member of the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces looks at destructions following a shelling in Ukraine's second-biggest city of Kharkiv on March 8, 2022.
       (Photo by SERGEY BOBOK/AFP via Getty Images) Combating an insurgency supplied with, and well-versed in the use of, a combination of EFPs and Stinger missiles is not an easy task. Add the Javelin man-portable anti-tank missile to the mix, along with technical intelligence support in the form of real-time information on Russian troop movements and radar and signals intercepts from the United States, and the Russian military is in for a protracted fight that might very well bleed them dry.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER With Ukrainians willing to fight and allies supplying them with weapons, training, and intelligence, supported via sanctuaries in bordering NATO countries, the Russian military machine can be effectively countered, especially when that effort is coupled with economic warfare and information propaganda campaigns focused on the Russian populace.     Russia and Ukraine are locked in a contest of wills. While the best-case scenario is an immediate cessation of all violence, bogging down the Russian war machine with troop, aircraft, and vehicle losses may raise the political pressure on Putin to stop his advance or lead to a coup, which has precedent in Russian history.

   WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan deal early Wednesday providing $13.6 billion to help  Ukraine  and European allies plus billions more to battle the pandemic as part of an overdue $1.5 trillion measure financing federal agencies for the rest of this year. Though a tiny portion of the massive bill, the money responding to the Russian blitzkrieg that’s devastated parts of Ukraine and prompted  Europe ’s worst refugee crisis since World War II ensured robust bipartisan support for the legislation. President  Joe Biden  had requested $10 billion for military, humanitarian and economic aid last week, and Democratic and Republican backing was so staunch that the figure grew to $12 billion Monday and $13.6 billion just a day later. ""We’re going to support them against tyranny, oppression, violent acts of subjugation,"" Biden said at the White House. US, UK MOVE TO BLOCK RUSSIAN OIL AS EUROPE CONSIDERS SIMILAR ACTION AMID UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES Party leaders hoped to whip the 2,741-page measure through the House on Wednesday and the Senate by week’s end, though that chamber’s exact timing was unclear. Lawmakers were spurred by the urgency of helping Ukraine before Russia’s military might makes it too late.

       (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) They also faced a Friday deadline to approve the government-wide spending measure or face a weekend election-year federal shutdown. As a backstop against delays, the House planned to pass a bill Wednesday keeping agencies afloat through March 15, said a House Democratic aide who wasn’t authorized to publicly describe the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity. ""War in Europe has focused the energies of  Congress  to getting something done and getting it done fast,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The bipartisan rallying behind the Ukraine aid package was just one manifestation of Congress’ eagerness to help the beleaguered country, though not all of it has been harmonious. POLAND THROTTLES UP SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE WITH OFFER TO HAND OVER FIGHTER JETS; PENTAGON PUMPS BRAKES Republicans accused Biden of moving too slowly to help Ukraine and NATO nations assisting it, and to impose sanctions against Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. They’ve also used the crisis to amplify their yearslong drive to ease drilling restrictions on federal lands and to oppose Democrats’ attempts to curb carbon-heavy fuels that worsen climate change. A bipartisan push to ban Russian oil imports had grown perhaps unstoppable before Biden announced Tuesday that he would do that on his own. Democrats said time was needed to bring along European allies that rely heavily on Russian energy sources. They also noted that plenty of drilling is available on nonfederal lands.     
      Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., arrives for a weekly policy luncheon, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 8, 2022.
       (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Before the $1.5 trillion measure was released, some details had already emerged of a bill bearing victories for both parties. Democrats won $15.6 billion for a fresh round of spending for vaccines, testing and treatments for COVID-19, including $5 billion for fighting the pandemic around the world. That was below Biden’s $22.5 billion request. RUSSIA EXPERT SHREDS BIDEN ADMIN OVER NO-FLY ZONE: 'DUMB AS A SIBERIAN SHOE' Republicans said they’d forced Democrats to pay for the entire amount by pulling back unspent money from past legislation. The money would come from previously approved spending for combating COVID-19 and for helping states cope with pandemic costs, said one person who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the legislation publicly. Schumer said there would be money for Biden’s ""Cancer Moonshot"" to find a cure for the disease and for increasing Pell grants for lower-income college students. Still unresolved was whether to include programs protecting women against domestic violence and strengthening the country’s cybersecurity, Schumer said. The overall measure was on track to increase overall defense and domestic spending over last year’s levels, though exact figures were not yet available. No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said Republicans were happy with the boost for the military. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the measure would provide loan guarantees to Poland to help it replace aircraft it is sending Ukraine. ""It’s been like pulling teeth"" to get Democrats to agree to some of the defense spending, he said. But he added, ""It’s an important step. It needs to be passed. It needs to be passed quickly.""

""There are some senators who won’t agree on anything, anytime, anywhere,"" said No. 2 House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., ""which is frustrating.""  ",2022-03

HARRIS TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR NATO ALLIES AS UKRAINE WAR ENTERS 14TH DAY: LIVE UPDATES  SEN. RON JOHNSON:  I'm not expecting much. Remember, they put Vice President Harris in charge of the border. That has been a complete fiasco, and if you really think about it, it's in those early days in the Biden administration, when he canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, opened up our borders, started pushing for out- of-control deficit spending, which has sparked 7.5% inflation, a 40-year high. All these policies, decisions have weakened America, it's emboldened our enemies, it's basically tempted tyrants to take advantage of the situation. So you have now a situation where tyrants are on the rise and we're trying to react. And it's very costly to react, as you're seeing with a $13 billion aid package. It would have been far better to supply Ukraine with the lethal defensive weaponry and keep them in a position where it might have changed Putin's calculation, but that's not what this administration did. What this administration's done is virtually, across the board, enact policies that have weakened this country.  WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW   Video  ",2022-03

Video Early Tuesday, a  bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers  sent a letter to President Biden urging him to support a deal with Poland.

The comments about Harris’ preparations come after the vice president faced widespread criticism after she attempted to provide an explanation of the Ukraine crisis during an appearance on the ""The Morning Hustle"" earlier this month.   Video Asked at one point to explain the crisis overseas in ""layman's terms"" for concerned listeners, Harris responded slowly, ""Ukraine is a country in Europe.

Meanwhile, Harris’ trip comes just a day after President Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports to the United States. The Biden administration made the announcement after coordination with European allies and partners, but acknowledged that many partners were not able to make the move, due to their heavy reliance on Russian energy. Biden's ban on Russian oil imports came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged ""boycotts"" of Russian oil from western allies.  Zelenskyy also has been urging the United States and European allies to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as Russia continues its brutal and unprovoked invasion.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pleading with Western allies on Monday, Zelenskyy asked: ""How many deaths and losses are still needed to secure the sky over Ukraine?""

   Many  Christians across the country  and around the world are celebrating Ember Days today — Wednesday, March 9, 2022 — as well as on Friday and Saturday of this week as part of  their 2022 Lenten observances . Explaining that Ember Days are ""old-fashioned, traditional"" observances perhaps going as far back as the fifth century A.D., Rev. Canon Victor Lee Austin, theologian-in-residence for the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas, Texas, told Fox News Digital in an interview that these special days are a time to pray for ""the ministry of the church."" FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT: REFLECT, REPENT   Given today's ""polarized"" and ""fractured"" world — and pointing to  the war in Ukraine  as tangible evidence of that — Fr. Austin said we need ""the ministry of reconciliation"" to spread throughout the world.     
      Ash Wednesday, exactly one week ago today, marked the start of Lent this year. Wednesday, March 9, 2022, is an Ember Day of Lent, as are this Friday and Saturday as well. 
       (Getty Images) There are four sets of Ember Days each year, which roughly follow the seasons.  The Lenten Ember Days always fall the week after  Ash Wednesday  and the first Sunday of Lent. ASH WEDNESDAY, START OF LENT: WE MUST ‘TURN TO GOD’ ""When I became an Episcopalian and first learned of these days, I thought they had some obscure connection to fire,"" said Austin. ""Not so,"" he continued. ""In Massey Shepherd's old commentary on the American Prayer Book, ‘ember’ is a shortening from the German ‘Quatember,’ itself from Latin ‘Quattuor Tempora,’ which means ‘four seasons.’""

       Speaking further on the ancient beginnings of Ember Days, Fr. Austin said the choice of Wednesday, Friday and Saturday comes from church practices in the early centuries A.D.  Back then, both Wednesday and Friday were set as days of fasting — and in Rome, Saturday was also a fast day in preparation for Sunday. LENT: WHAT IS IT AND WHY DO WE OBSERVE IT? The focus of Ember Days used to be exclusively on ordained ministry — bishops, priests and deacons, said Austin.  In recent decades, the emphasis has broadened, he said. In the Episcopal Church today, for example, there are three prayers — each of the Ember Days has a slightly different focus.      
      Fr. Austin of Dallas spoke to Fox News Digital in March 2022 about Lent's Ember Days — and the importance of reconciliation at this time of year.
       (Rev. Canon Victor Lee Austin) First:  A prayer for the ordained, that God would ""fill them with the truth of thy doctrine"" and ""clothe them with holiness of life,"" said Fr. Austin.  This is a prayer that the ordained continue in faithful service throughout their life, something that cannot be done without God's special help, ""which is what we mean by grace,"" he said. ""Ember Days [highlight] the fact that the church itself has a vocation, and that is to be an instrument of God for the spread of his kingdom,"" said Fr. Austin of Dallas, Texas.   Second:  A prayer that fit persons are chosen for the ordained ministry; in other words, this is a prayer for discernment. This prayer turns our attention to the ""processes in the church"" by which discernment is made of whom to ordain, said Austin.  ""Priests are not lone rangers; they live and work as part of the whole church,"" he noted.

       (iStock) Third:  We pray for all Christians during Ember Days. All Christians have a ministry, ordained or not, said Fr. Austin.  The prayer is offered ""for all members of thy holy Church,"" that they would serve God in truth and godliness ""in their vocation and ministry."" ""Ember Days [highlight] the fact that the church itself has a vocation, and that is to be an instrument of God for the spread of his kingdom,"" Austin said, noting that every Christian person has some part to play in that ""very big calling.""  TIM TEBOW, MAN ON A MISSION: EVERY ONE OF US HAS A PURPOSE ON EARTH For most, at part will not be in the worship of the church itself, but out in the world — in school, or business or home — wherever God has led them.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The big purpose of the whole ministry of the church"" is the reconciliation of people ""with one another, and with God,"" Fr.

And they brought on massive sanctions against the Russian economy, which are going to hurt very, very deeply."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

       Volker added that Putin's ""only way to stay in power is to pursue a military victory."" But even if a military victory is in store for Putin, Russia's future relationships with other countries remains increasingly isolated and unstable – and not only in the West. Foreign policy experts, including Volker, have noted strained tensions in recent weeks between Russia and its most significant ally, China, amid its invasion of Ukraine.  ""Putin is bent on taking territory, destroying Ukraine as a country. … And I would like to come back to that China has no interest in that at all, and, I think is trying to distance itself a little bit from Russia's military actions, including, for instance, abstaining at the U.N. rather than supporting Russia,"" Volker said earlier in the podcast episode, referencing a  Feb. 25 U.N. resolution  condemning Putin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The resolution holds no legal authority but serves as a symbol of global unity against Putin as only five of the 181 nations present for the vote opposed the measure.  China's sole interests in Asia ""revolve around regaining Taiwan, which they do not view as a parallel with Ukraine,"" Volker said.

       ""Putin may think of it as a parallel, but China knows and has recognized Ukraine as a sovereign state – as a member of the United Nations. And what Russia is doing is attacking a sovereign state and trying to wipe it out. That is not something that China is interested in doing or being associated with,"" he explained. ""China also looks at Russia as a declining power – small in economic scale, small population, and not getting better, and not taking good care of its own people. Very much of a thuggish regime."" While China and Russia are aligned in their opposition to the West dominating ""the global order,"" China sees itself as a country that has ""lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and taking care of its population"" and ""cares about advancing the state,"" the former NATO ambassador said. TOP INTEL REPUBLICANS WARN OF NUCLEAR AGGRESSION, ACCUSE BIDEN OF USING UKRAINE WAR AS A 'SHIELD' FOR POLICIES Volker and Ashford argued broadly about the United States' stance defending Ukraine, Ukraine's place in or outside NATO, the benefits or downsides of sanctions against Russia, and more over the course of the podcast episode. Ashford argued that the U.S. does not have ""a moral obligation to defend people all around the world against whatever may come their way."" ""[W]e live in a world where the things that we can achieve have to be bounded by reality. And again, we have drawn this very clear line between NATO states and non-NATO member states prior this conflict for a reason,"" she said. ""The states that are currently in NATO … we can question the wisdom of that expansion, but we have been planning to defend them. We have U.S. forces in place. Ukraine is a completely different situation – one in which we're not prepared to defend them.""

       Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pushing for NATO to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but the organization  ruled out  the move out of fear that it could worsen the conflict. Ashford also argued that while the humanitarian impacts of the war must be minimized, she believes sanctions against Russia will only hurt the U.S. in the long run because they will strengthen Russia's relationship with China over the coming years. Volker, meanwhile, believes the U.S. is ""well-positioned"" to defend Ukraine ""because we have a Ukrainian government that does show extraordinary bravery and determination and resolve to defend their country and a Ukrainian military that has done an exceptional job defending Ukraine against a massive Russian Army,"" while the Russian military ""has had a disastrous time trying to invade Ukraine for a number of reasons.""

   Former Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger  essentially predicted the  current situation  that led to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a chilling op-ed published eight years ago.  Kissinger  penned an op-ed in the Washington Post  on March 5, 2014 headlined, ""To settle the Ukraine crisis, start at the end,"" which detailed much of what has unfolded as Russia’s attack continues.  ""Public discussion on Ukraine is all about confrontation. But do we know where we are going? In my life, I have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm and public support, all of which we did not know how to end and from three of which we withdrew unilaterally. The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins,"" Kissinger wrote.

       (The Associated Press) ""Far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side’s outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between them,"" he continued. ""Russia must accept that to try to force Ukraine into a satellite status, and thereby move Russia’s borders again, would doom Moscow to repeat its history of self-fulfilling cycles of reciprocal pressures with Europe and the United States."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES The eight-year-old piece detailed why many Russians historically feel that Ukraine would never be seen as an independent country.      
      A Russian attack severely damaged a children's hospital and maternity ward in the besieged port city of Mariupol on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said.
       (Mariupol City Council) ""The West must understand that, to Russia, Ukraine can never be just a foreign country. Russian history began in what was called Kievan-Rus. The Russian religion spread from there. Ukraine has been part of Russia for centuries, and their histories were intertwined before then. Some of the most important battles for Russian freedom, starting with the Battle of Polyvana in 1709, we fought on Ukrainian soil,"" Kissinger who was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977, continued.  HENRY KISSINGER: AMERICA 'LOST STRATEGIC FOCUS' IN AFGHANISTAN WITH UNATTAINABLE GOALS Kissinger explained why priorities needed to be established in order for Ukraine to thrive.  ""Even such famed dissidents as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Brodsky insisted that Ukraine was an integral part of Russian history and, indeed, of Russia,"" he wrote. ""The European Union must recognize that its bureaucratic dilatoriness and subordination of the strategic element to domestic politics in negotiating Ukraine’s relationship to Europe contributed to turning a negotiation into a crisis. Foreign policy is the art of establishing priorities."" Kissinger called Ukrainians ""the decisive element"" because they live in a country with a deep history and a ""polyglot composition,"" noting the Western part of the nation was ""incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939, when Stalin and Hitler divided up the spoils"" but the largely Russian section of Crimea didn’t become part of Ukraine until 1954.  ""The west is largely Catholic; the east largely Russian Orthodox. The west speaks Ukrainian; the east speaks mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other — as has been the pattern — would lead eventually to civil war or break up. To treat Ukraine as part of an East-West confrontation would scuttle for decades any prospect to bring Russia and the West — especially Russia and Europe — into a cooperative international system,"" Kissinger wrote.

       (The Associated Press) RUSSIA EXPERT SHREDS BIDEN ADMIN OVER UKRAINE NO-FLY ZONE: 'DUMB AS A SIBERIAN SHOE' When Kissinger penned the column, Ukraine had been independent for only 23 years.  ""Not surprisingly, its leaders have not learned the art of compromise, even less of historical perspective. The politics of post-independence Ukraine clearly demonstrates that the root of the problem lies in efforts by Ukrainian politicians to impose their will on recalcitrant parts of the country, first by one faction, then by the other,"" he wrote.  ""A wise U.S. policy toward Ukraine would seek a way for the two parts of the country to cooperate with each other. We should seek reconciliation, not the domination of a faction,"" Kissinger added. ""Russia and the West, and least of all the various factions in Ukraine, have not acted on this principle. Each has made the situation worse. Russia would not be able to impose a military solution without isolating itself at a time when many of its borders are already precarious. For the West, the demonization of Vladimir Putin is not a policy; it is an alibi for the absence of one."" He stated Putin should come to realize, despite ""grievances,"" that a ""policy of military impositions would produce another Cold War.""

""Leaders of all sides should return to examining outcomes, not compete in posturing."" WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US IMPOSED A NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE? The former Secretary of State then laid out his ""notion of an outcome compatible with the values and security interests of all sides"" in a four-part plan.  ""1. Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations, including with Europe. 2. Ukraine should not join NATO, a position I took seven years ago, when it last came up,"" he wrote.  ""3. Ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people. Wise Ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country. Internationally, they should pursue a posture comparable to that of Finland. That nation leaves no doubt about its fierce independence and cooperates with the West in most fields but carefully avoids institutional hostility toward Russia,"" Kissinger continued. ""4. It is incompatible with the rules of the existing world order for Russia to annex Crimea. But it should be possible to put Crimea’s relationship to Ukraine on a less fraught basis. To that end, Russia would recognize Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea. Ukraine should reinforce Crimea’s autonomy in elections held in the presence of international observers.

The 750 kV Chernobyl-Kyiv high-voltage line is currently disconnected ""due to damage by the occupiers,"" Energoatom, or the state-run National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine, said Wednesday.  The Chernobyl station  and all nuclear facilities of the Exclusion Zone are without electricity.  The regulator explained that there are about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies stored at the facility that require constant cooling. Without electricity to cool the pumps, the temperature in the holding pools will increase, prompting the release of radioactive substances into the environment.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""The only electrical grid supplying the Chornobyl NPP and all its nuclear facilities occupied by  Russian army is damaged ,"" Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Wednesday.  ""CNPP lost all electric supply. I call on the international community to urgently demand Russia to cease fire and allow repair units to restore power supply.""  ""Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP,"" he added. ""After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent.  Putin’s barbaric war  puts entire Europe in danger. He must stop it immediately!"" Wind can transfer the radioactive cloud to  other regions of Ukraine , Belarus, Russia and Europe, according to Energoatom. Ventilation at the facility also won’t function without electricity, so some 210 captured technical personnel and guards who have been working to maintain the facility since Russian forces took control of the site two weeks ago risk exposure to radiation.

Fighting is currently underway, making it impossible to carry out repairs and restore power, Energoatom said. The city of Slavutych is also without electricity. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: RUSSIAN NUCLEAR THREAT ‘LIKELY INCREASING,' US INTEL OFFICIALS SAY The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine informed them of the power loss at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the development violated a key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply. As of now, the IAEA does not see a critical impact on safety.  The IAEA had warned Tuesday that the same shift has been on duty at the Chernobyl NPP since the day before the Russian military entered the site of the 1986 accident on Feb. 24, meaning staff have in effect been living there for the past two weeks.  Grossi has repeatedly stressed that staff operating nuclear facilities must be able to rest and work in regular shifts, stating this is crucial for overall nuclear safety, the IAEE said. Their capacity to make decisions ""free of undue pressure is among the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security"" he outlined at a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on March 2.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the  Chornobyl nuclear power plant  and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,"" Grossi said in a statement. ""I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.""  Regarding the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors were operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP controlled since last week by Russian forces, and that the plants’ personnel were working in shifts.

   The White House is blaming Russian President  Vladimir Putin  for  record-high gas  prices in the United States, coining the surge as the #PutinPriceHike and vowing that  President Biden  will do everything he can to shield Americans ""from pain at the pump."" Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon – the  highest average to date , according to AAA. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES White House communications director Kate Bedingfield on Wednesday tweeted that, for months, Putin ""has been saber-rattling, and for months, gas prices have been going up — up 75 cents since he began his military build-up"" along the Ukrainian border. ""This is the #PutinPriceHike in action, and @POTUS is going to use every tool at his disposal to shield Americans from pain at the pump,"" she wrote. Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the ""main artery"" of Russia's economy amid Putin’s war on Ukraine. BIDEN CLAIMS 'NOT TRUE' HE IS HOLDING BACK US ENERGY, WARNS RUSSIAN OIL BAN WILL COST AMERICANS During remarks from the White House Tuesday, though, Biden warned Americans that the ban would cost American families. ""Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders,"" Biden warned. ""And with this action, it's going to go up further. I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home and coordination with our partners.""    The president, speaking from the White House on Tuesday, said the ban has ""strong bipartisan support in  Congress  and, I believe, the country."" ""Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war,"" Biden said. Russian oil exports account for about one-third of Europe’s oil imports, however, for the United States, Russian exports are just under 10% of U.S. overall imports. RUSSIA 'DOES NOT WANT A DIRECT CONFLICT WITH US FORCES,' INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ASSESSED IN JANUARY   Video The president was asked on Tuesday if he had a message for the American people on gas prices.

BIDEN ANNOUNCES BAN ON US IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN OIL, WARNS GAS PRICES WILL 'GO UP FURTHER' Biden has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for high gas prices, which have risen sharply under his administration even before Russia’s invasion. Many have publicly called for him to open up oil and gas drilling in the United States to lessen the country’s dependence on foreign oil.   Video Biden, on Tuesday, though, said it is ""not true"" that his administration is holding back domestic energy production, warning that gas prices will ""go up further"" from their current record levels, and reiterated his support for government spending on renewable energy sources and criticizing the oil and gas industry for not taking full advantage of drilling opportunities in the U.S. Biden said it is ""simply not true"" that his policies ""are holding back domestic energy production."" RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A 'VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD' ""Even amid the pandemic, companies in the United States pumped more oil during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor’s first year,"" he said. ""We're approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United States, and we’re on track to set a record of oil production next,"" he said, adding that in the U.S. ""90% of onshore oil production takes place on land that isn’t owned by the federal government.""    Video ""And the remaining 10% that occurs on federal land, the oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased — they have 9,000 permits to drill,"" he said. ""Now, they could be drilling right now. Yesterday, last week, last year, they have 9,000 [permits] to drill onshore that are already approved. ""So let me be clear: they are not using them for production. That’s their decision. These are the facts. We should be honest about the facts.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But American Petroleum Institute CEO  Mike Sommers told FOX Business  on Monday that the White House ""certainly doesn't have their facts straight on this,"" adding that a lease is merely the first step in a process that includes investigating whether there is any oil or gas in the land.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES The defense official’s rejection of the Russian narrative came after Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that Ukraine does have labs, and that the U.S. was helping them keep Russia from taking them over.

   Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday pleaded with the U.S. and Poland to find a way to send his country MiG-29 warplanes as  Russian forces  continue to pummel Ukraine.  ""We are grateful to Poland…for its readiness to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft,"" Zelenskyy said in a virtual address.

      This image taken from video issued by Mariupol City Council in Ukraine shows the aftermath of Mariupol Hospital after a Russian attack on March 9, 2022. 
       (Mariupol City Council) Zelenskyy’s comments came just one day after NATO-ally Poland surprised the U.S. by announcing it would send all MiG-29 warplanes to the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Pentagon pushed back on the move and said it raised real concerns regarding the deployment of warplanes from a U.S. base in a NATO-allied nation to combat Russian forces. ""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. The U.S. has repeatedly said it will not send troops to Ukraine. Instead, the U.S. has granted Kyiv more than $1 billion in security assistance, including through the provision of 17,000 Javellin, Stinger and MANPAD missiles.  Two senior U.S. defense officials told Fox News Wednesday that the U.S. will not stop Poland from sending the MiG-29 planes, but said flying them to Ramstein Air Base is logistically tricky and could risk broadening the conflict.   PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS

       (AP Photo/Alik Keplicz) In order to be effective, the MiGs would likely need to bomb territory in Belarus and Russia where Putin’s air defense units are located, according to the senior defense officials.  ""The MiGs would need to suppress Russia’s air defense systems before flying and that would require bombing Russia and Belarus,"" they added.  Roughly 710 missiles have been levied at Ukraine, half of which have been launched from Russia while the other half have been fired by Russian forces in Ukraine, Belarus and occupied-Crimea.  Half a dozen missiles have also been launched from naval vessels on the Black Sea. Russia has yet to gain air superiority over Ukraine, largely because Ukrainian forces have MANPADS – which are shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile defense systems. Senior defense officials said the conflict in Ukraine remains largely a ""ground war"" and surface-to-air missile defense systems are more heavily relied on by both Ukrainian and Russian forces as opposed to ""fixed-wing aircraft."" ""Russia has anti-aircraft batteries – surface-to-air missiles – that create an umbrella over nearly all of Ukraine airspace, which makes flying warplanes [for anyone] difficult,"" an official said Wednesday. Putin has deployed roughly all the 150,000 troops he amassed on Ukraine’s border in the lead-up to the invasion and, despite the loss of 700 Russian military vehicles, Moscow has maintained roughly 90% of its combat force.

423,"In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, war should not be blind: Will Cain",Will Cain,2022-03-09 13:56:00,"  close     Video   Will Cain: War should not be blind   When it comes to making a decision about whether to go to war, one that could result in nuclear war, we need to be as rational as possible, Fox News host says. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   For two years, emotion has been driving our prism throughout what should be the most consequential, rational, logical decisions of our lives –  whether or not to go outside, whether or not to breathe free air, whether or not to inject our children with a vaccine. In calmer moments, we would say, ""Yeah, I think I want to hear out all the arguments on this one."" But we didn't because the emotion of fear took our culture and changed it into something that we would never have accepted and most likely, never have recognized.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES Today, when it comes to  Ukraine  and the  Russian  invasion of Ukraine, I can see that we're headed down a similar path. Here's what I mean: This time we're not driven by fear; we're driven more by empathy. We see horrible images go across our social media feed or on our television screen. We see civilian lives, loss of life. We see absolute travesties that warrant, at some point, a discussion of war crimes. And we're driven by empathy to do something. You can't let this continue. We have to do something. And by the way, the emotion of fear is playing a role as well because we sit here and not irrationally fear what  Vladimir Putin 's next move may be.  I want to be clear about something: I'm not telling you that I believe emotion has no role in life. In fact, as I've gotten older, I've actually started to appreciate more the role of emotion. There was probably a time when I thought rationality and logic and turning ourselves into essentially automated robots was the best way to achieve a just society. I was wrong. Logic is cold. It has its role, and you can tell anyone who listens to this knows I lean heavily on logic.   Video But I've also come to understand sometimes that the world operates by very simple emotions – fear, strength, weakness, courage. I know that not only is the world explained by emotion, but emotion is important. It makes life richer. It can't be all black and white. It brings out the colors, and sometimes even though something is irrational, that's part of being human. That's part of this life.  But when it comes to making a decision about whether or not to go to war, one that could result in nuclear war, one whose costs could be incalculable, I do want to be as rational as possible. Emotion, empathy, the humanitarian cause, the pleas of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the words in our mind that carry such heavy impact —  words like freedom, the concept of the underdog – they all lurk, playing on the irrational decision. But I don't think we can give in to it. I don't think we should just do something.  I mean, let's just put into context what that kind of irrationality leads to, how that kind of irrationality is a false North Star. I don't hear many calls right now for us to do something in  Syria . In Syria, little children are gassed. Chemical weapons. Chemical warfare. They die. They're disfigured. People die by the thousands in Syria because there's a civil war between separatists and Bashar al-Assad, the authoritarian dictator in Syria, who, by the way, is backed by Vladimir Putin, who's being funded and given weapons and supported by Russia.      
      A Ukrainian serviceman aims towards Russian positions outside the city of Brovary, east of Kyiv, on March 9, 2022. 
       ((Photo by ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images)) And oh, by the way, one more time: This travesty, these war crimes, this horrible, horrible loss of human life has been going on for over a decade, but we haven't been compelled by our media. Our brains haven't given into images to just do something. Why? And don't think Syria and Ukraine are the only places in the world where horrible things are happening. But I want to be clear about something: That doesn't mean we don't do something even if we don't do it everywhere. I don't believe that. I don't think just pointing out our inconsistency says, well, throw up your hands – don't do anything.  It just means, hey, recognize we may not be living in the land of principle. We may not be living in the land of reason and logic. On the other side — and it's weird how political lines are totally scattered right now – I can hear from those on the right who say, ""What are you so afraid of? Why are you such a coward? Why does Vladimir Putin scare you so much? We got to go get him."" I think it's worth setting aside for a moment, in our own decision-making, about putting American interests first.    And look, even though I used that voice, I don't blow off that kind of mindset, either. I love that America irrationally has an empathetic streak to help people, even when we don't help everyone. I also love that America irrationally sometimes just wants to kick some ass and do the right thing. But I know that those are instincts. I don't want to rip them out of the human experience. But I also want them to have the steering wheel. You can't just go marching boots into Ukraine. You can't impose a no-fly zone. You have to go through the process of the dominoes of warfare playing out, and you have to try to get inside the mind of your opponent. You do it if you're playing chess, you would do it if you were on the basketball court. You would do it if you're on the offensive line facing a defensive lineman.    Video You would try to get into the mind of your opponent. What will they do? Will he try a spin move? Which way is he going to cross over, left or right? You would ask yourself what you have to guard, not just to play defense, so that you know how and when to play offense, and you have to do the same thing in warfare.  CLICK BELOW TO LISTEN TO THE FULL EPISODE OF ""THE WILL CAIN PODCAST"":   What would make Vladimir Putin launch a conventional war against a narrow country?

   President Biden’s  climate czar, John Kerry, said that while the Ukraine refugee crisis is a ""problem"" amid Russia’s invasion, it pales in comparison to the wave of migration that will come if climate change is not addressed.  Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for  climate , said during the annual CERAWeek conference in Houston Monday that the U.S. must not lose sight of its path toward clean energy now that the  Russia - Ukraine  war has accelerated the global energy crisis. JOHN KERRY FEARS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR WILL DISTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE ""We’re already seeing climate refugees around the world,"" he said. ""If you think migration has been a problem in Europe in the Syrian War or even from what we see now, wait until you see 100 million people for whom the entire food production capacity has collapsed."" President Biden told reporters Tuesday that he ""can’t do much"" about rising gas prices and blamed the situation on Russia’s war against Ukraine. The president announced Tuesday a  ban on Russian oil , gas and energy imports to the U.S. in an effort to weaken Russian President Vladimir Putin, but the move is expected to push U.S. gas prices even higher as they soar past levels last seen during the Great Recession.  As of Wednesday afternoon, the national average was $4.29. While Republicans and some Democrats have called for expanded domestic oil production as a solution, Biden has continued to push his green agenda. ""Loosening environmental regulations won’t lower prices,"" the president declared in a tweet Tuesday evening. ""But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles, powered by clean energy, will mean that no one will have to worry about gas prices. It will mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as a weapon."" Kerry said Monday that the goal of the Biden administration is to move toward ""energy security"" in a ""clean energy-based economy."" ""We are driven not by politics, not by ideology,"" he said. ""We're driven by mathematics and physics, by science, which tells us, and has been for 35 years or more, what will happen if we don't do X, Y, and Z.  ""And we have the advantage now of having Mother Nature herself share with us the realities of what happens if you don’t do the things that we’ve been talking about for 25, 30 years or more,"" he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kerry has made similar comments linking climate change to the crisis in Ukraine. Last month,  he told BBC Arabic  that the war will have a ""profound negative impact on the climate."" ""You have a war, and obviously you’re going to have massive emissions consequences to the war.

But U.S. defense officials have warned that deploying warplanes from a U.S. base in a NATO-allied nation could further escalate Russia’s aggression – a concern that was echoed by the British foreign secretary.

   Europe's green energy policies empowered Russian President Vladimir Putin and stripped Western countries of their ability to sanction Moscow effectively, according to the best-selling author of ""Apocalypse Never."" ""You're not really an independent nation if you depend on foreign countries so heavily for your energy supplies,"" Michael Shellenberger told Fox News. He said  European  nations have become increasingly dependent on Russia for energy in recent years as they have adopted green policy initiatives. The continent imports nearly 40% of its gas from  Russia ,  according to the Associated Press.  It consumes nearly five times as much oil as it produces, and Russia produces nearly four times as much oil as it consumes, according to  British Petroleum .  Europe's dependency on Russian energy limits its ability to take actions such as imposing economic sanctions against Russia in response to the conflict in Ukraine, according to Shellenberger.

       UKRAINE CONFLICT ‘HEIGHTENS THE RISK’ OF CHINESE-AMERICAN WAR, PROFESSOR SAYS ""Fifteen years ago, Europe produced more natural gas than Russia,"" Shellenberger said. ""Today, Russia exports three times more natural gas to Europe than Europe produces.""  "" That's due both to the fact that Russia increased its natural gas production and Europe reduced it,"" he added.       
      Green energy policies have made Europe dependent on Russia
       ""Europe decided not to frack in large part in response to climate activists,"" Shellenberger told Fox News. ""We now think there is strong evidence suggesting [the climate activists] were supported directly through financing from Russia.""  Moscow intelligence agencies, for example, secretly supported European environmental groups in campaigns against fracking in order to keep the European Union dependent on Russian exports, according to a  2018 congressional report .     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin
       (Reuters) But environmental activist groups do not disclose their donors, so any benefactors of Russia’s donations remain unknown, according to Shellenberger. Additionally, Europeans became more reliant on Russian energy because of nuclear energy policies. Putin ""expanded nuclear power at home so that he could export more natural gas abroad rather than use it for electricity production,"" Shellenberger said. ""Europe shut down its nuclear plants and declined to build new ones."" Russia's  nuclear power capacity has increased by 33% since 2002, according to the World Nuclear Association.  Germany's  nuclear capacity has decreased by over 80% in that time period. ""That has proven to be catastrophic as the continent became increasingly dependent on Russia for energy imports,"" Shellenberger told Fox News.  Shellenberger described rising oil costs and foreign dependencies as ""the worst energy crisis since 1973.""  ""I think the chances are very high that it's going to result in a global recession,"" Shellenberger told Fox News. ""When oil prices reach these levels, they tend to trigger recessions."" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas recently  told Barron's : ""History shows that a 100% increase in oil prices over a year usually triggers a recession (1990, 2000, 2008). We’re not quite there yet, but we are getting closer by the day. Crude oil reached $130 per barrel Sunday evening,  according to CNBC . A year ago, it was $63.81. Shellenberger said oil prices could hit $200 per barrel.  European reliance on Russian energy leaves Western countries with little leverage against Putin in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, according to Shellenberger.  President Biden announced on Tuesday a  ban on U.S. imports of Russia oil . Last year, the U.S. imported 7% of its petroleum from Russia, according to the  U.S. Energy Information Administration .   ""Our hearts are with the Ukrainians,"" Shellenberger said. ""We would love to be able to punish the Russians and stop importing their energy, but efforts to do that will make energy more expensive.""

       ""It was always predictable,"" Shellenberger said of the energy crisis and European dependence on Russian energy. ""This was all very apparent to people that were rational thinkers on energy."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Prosperity, sovereignty and energy independence are all interconnected, according to Shellenberger. ""There is no low-energy rich nation, just as there is no high-energy poor nation,"" he said.  ""I hope it’s a wake-up call,"" Shellenberger told Fox News. ""At best, we can hope to avoid a global recession, but that's going to require a significant expansion of energy supplies in the United States and Europe as quickly as we can.""   ",2022-03

   The White House on Wednesday warned that Russia could use ""chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"" or could create a ""false flag operation"" using them, after the Kremlin accused the U.S. of being involved in  biological weapons  research at Ukrainian labs. The director of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ information and press department, Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, said that in the course of Russia’s invasion of  Ukraine , Russia confirmed that Ukrainian leadership was quickly trying to clean up any trace of ""military and biological programs"" that Ukraine was conducting with financial backing from the United States.

He continued, ""That was one of a slew of stories around that time that painted Harris -- and Biden -- as frustrated with the vice president's office.

   The White House on Wednesday said it has ""no plans"" to restart construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, despite saying that all options were on the table in addressing the record-high  gas prices  as Russia’s war against Ukraine rages on. Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon – the  highest average to date , according to AAA. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES President Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the ""main artery"" of Russia's economy amid Putin’s war on Ukraine. During remarks from the White House Tuesday, though, Biden warned Americans that the ban would cost American families.     
      Press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.
       (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) ""Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders,"" Biden warned. ""And with this action, it's going to go up further. I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home in coordination with our partners.""  On Wednesday, though, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said restarting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was not one of the options on the table.   Video ""If we’re trying to bring about more supply that does not address any problem,"" Psaki said. ""The pipeline is just a delivery mechanism – it’s not an oil field, so it does not provide more supply into the system."" When pressed further on whether restarting the pipeline is something the White House is considering, Psaki said: ""There’s no plans for that, and it would not address any of the problems we’re having currently."" BIDEN CLAIMS 'NOT TRUE' HE IS HOLDING BACK US ENERGY, WARNS RUSSIAN OIL BAN WILL COST AMERICANS Biden has been facing criticism from Republicans, urging him to lift his executive orders that canceled the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and froze new oil and gas leases on federal lands. He has also been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for high gas prices, which have risen sharply under his administration even before Russia’s invasion. Many have publicly called for him to open up oil and gas drilling in the United States to lessen the country’s dependence on foreign oil. Biden, on Tuesday, though, said it is ""not true"" that his administration is holding back domestic energy production, warning that gas prices will ""go up further"" from their current record levels, and reiterated his support for government spending on renewable energy sources and criticizing the oil and gas industry for not taking full advantage of drilling opportunities in the U.S.

       Biden said it is ""simply not true"" that his policies ""are holding back domestic energy production."" ""Even amid the pandemic, companies in the United States pumped more oil during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor’s first year,"" he said. BIDEN ANNOUNCES BAN ON US IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN OIL, WARNS GAS PRICES WILL 'GO UP FURTHER' ""We're approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United States, and we’re on track to set a record of oil production next,"" he said, adding that in the U.S. ""90% of onshore oil production takes place on land that isn’t owned by the federal government.""  ""And the remaining 10% that occurs on federal land, the oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased – they have 9,000 permits to drill,"" he said. ""Now, they could be drilling right now. Yesterday, last week, last year, they have 9,000 [permits] to drill onshore that are already approved. ""So let me be clear: they are not using them for production. That’s their decision. These are the facts. We should be honest about the facts.""

WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING '#PUTINPRICEHIKE' ""What is happening here is that we are seeing – these are private sector companies, we recognize that many of them are making record profits. We see that that is all publicly available data,"" Psaki said. ""They have pressure to return cash to investors and their shareholders."" She added: ""What we're saying right now is there is a war. We're asking them to go use the approved permits, use the unused space and go get more supply out of the ground in our own country.""   Meanwhile, the White House is blaming Russian President  Vladimir Putin  for  record-high gas  prices in the United States, coining the surge as the ""#PutinPriceHike."" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield on Wednesday tweeted that, for months, Putin ""has been saber-rattling, and for months, gas prices have been going up – up 75 cents since he began his military build-up"" along the Ukrainian border. ""This is the #PutinPriceHike in action, and @POTUS is going to use every tool at his disposal to shield Americans from pain at the pump,"" she wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When asked about the new hashtag, Psaki said that ""events in the world, including the invasion by Russia of a foreign country, does prompt instability and volatility in the global oil markets."" ""There are all sorts of different issues that can impact that, that’s what we’re seeing now,"" Psaki said, noting economists and analysts have ""conveyed and said publicly that Russia’s invasion, Russia’s build-up of troops, President Putin’s to do that very early this year, led to a lot of instability and volatility in the oil markets."" RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A 'VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD' ""So, therefore, if President Putin’s build-up of military troops is leading to volatility and an increase in oil and prices, hence, you have a Putin pump, gas price pump rise,"" Psaki said. Meanwhile, the president was asked on Tuesday if he had a message for the American people on gas prices. ""They’re going to go up,"" he said.

   On Feb. 23 I presented the first part of my Ph.D. study, dedicated to ultra-marathon running, at my university. After that, I packed my bags and checked-in online for the flight to Barcelona that was planned for Feb. 24.  I had just finished a very hard training cycle with peak volume of more than 140 miles per week and was ready to start a sixth race at Ultra Running Barcelona on Feb. 27. Prepared to fly to Spain the next day, my girlfriend and I fell asleep. We woke up at 5 a.m. because of the sound of explosions. We checked news and find out that there was attack on Boryspil airport and a lot of other objects all around Ukraine. The war had started.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Our decision was to get to Zhytomyr – 80 miles from Kyiv. This is my girlfriend’s hometown. Her parents live there and also my car was there. To get to my car to become more mobile, stay together and then make a decision about next steps – was our choice.

(Serhei Popov) The problem was that the way to Zhytomyr already was jammed with traffic. Almost without any movement. Thousands of cars tried to escape in panic. So, we decided to wait a day until first wave of panic would stop. At that time our friends from Irpin (town just near Kyiv) welcomed us to stay the night with them, suggesting that it would be easier to travel from this town in the morning.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: PHOTOS SHOW UKRAINIANS TRAVERSING BROKEN BRIDGES TO FLEE AS THOSE AT HOME BURY THEIR DEAD Just when we got to our friends’ house, the fight for Hostomel airport, which neighbors on Irpin, started. From Feb. 25 to 26 we spent the night in the basement of a private house. It was a small dusty place where five adults, a 5-month-old baby, a dog and a cat slept on the floor. Actually, we did not really sleep because of the explosions that continued all night. In the morning we all got into our friend’s car and left the town.  You feel shaking walls, think that this is the end.   The traffic on the road to Zhytomyr was very hard. It took us about five hours to get to the city (usually it’s three times faster). When we arrived, we found out that bridge to Kyiv was destroyed so it is not possible anymore to return the same way. Also, we heard news about fights near Kyiv from other sides of the capital of Ukraine.

For now, to join Ukrainian army or local defense force you have to have appropriate experience, which I don’t have.  So, me and my girlfriend just started to do what we could.

Public transport is restricted, but it works. Everything is alright with electricity, phone connection and internet. There is no panic, just preparation to meet Russians if they will try to get there.   Video As in other big Ukrainian cities, Zhytomyr suffers from Russian bombs and missiles. First time I was really scared when Russian missiles hit residential area just a few hundred meters from our home.  The noise of approaching missiles or jets is terrifying. You feel shaking walls, think that this is the end. Those days Russians killed 4 civilians in the city. Dozens of houses were totally destroyed.

   China  is backing  Russia’s claims  about U.S.-controlled ""biolabs"" in Ukraine conducting ""biological military activities"" – accusations the  White House  and Ukraine have both denied. The allegations come two weeks into V ladimir Putin's invasion  of his smaller neighbor. ""According to data released by the US, it has 26 bio-labs and other related facilities in Ukraine, over which the US Department of Defense has absolute control,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said during a news conference Tuesday. ""All dangerous pathogens in Ukraine must be stored in these labs and all research activities are led by the US side. Without US approval, no information shall be released to the public."" Zhao was echoing claims from his Russian counterpart Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, who said Kremlin troops found evidence that Ukrainians are covering up evidence of ""military biological programs"" in fear that the invading army will learn more. U.S. officials have said the idea is ""absurd"" and that Russia could be using it as cover ahead of a possible chemical or biological attack on Ukraine. China has also struggled to fend off concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may have  originated in a lab in its city of Wuhan .

""It’s a clear pattern, and no one should fall for it."" Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the U.S. has led an international effort to secure and dismantle leftover Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction, including in Ukraine.

It also allowed the U.S. and Ukraine to work together on public health research. As early as May 2020, Ukrainian officials called reports of American military biolabs within their borders ""fake news,"" the  Kyiv Post  reported at the time. Russia, on the other hand, has a history of violating international laws governing biological and chemical weapons, Psaki said – citing the attempted poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny and Russia’s support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, who has used chemical weapons to quell domestic rebellions. Still, Zhao accused the U.S. of ""stonewalling"" and dismissing China and Russia’s claims as ""spreading disinformation."" ""It’s exactly the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries around the world, which have been debunked conclusively, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,"" she said.

""We are not developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine,"" he said.  ""It's not happening."" However, the claims generated renewed interest Tuesday when Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. was concerned about Russian troops seizing ""biological research facilities"" in Ukraine.

Rubio then asked whether Nuland believed Ukraine would conduct a biological attack within its own borders. ""I’m sure you’re aware that the Russian propaganda groups [are] already putting out there all kinds of information about how they’ve uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country, with NATO’s coordination,"" Rubio said.

   The New York Times  published a ""fact check"" dismissing  GOP  criticism of  President Biden  as gas prices surge across the nation.  As the Russia-Ukraine crisis continues to unfold, there had been mounting pressure for the Biden administration to ban energy imports from Russia and to rely on resources within the U.S. rather than turn to other authoritarian nations like Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia for oil, all while prices at the pump have reached record numbers and were increasing long before the invasion.  BIDEN OFFICIAL ON IF RUSSIA WILL CONVINCE BIDEN TO REEVALUATE KEYSTONE PIPELINE: ‘NO, THAT’S A DISTRACTION' However, the Times declared Republicans ""wrongly blame Biden"" for the soaring gas prices.  ""As gas prices hit a high this week, top Republican lawmakers took to the airwaves and the floors of Congress with misleading claims that pinned the blame on President Biden and his energy policies,"" Times fact-check reporter Linda Qiu wrote Wednesday. ""While Republican lawmakers supported the ban, they asserted that the pain at the pump long preceded the war in Ukraine. Gas price hikes, they said, were the result of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, the temporary halt on new drilling leases on public lands and the surrendering of 'energy independence' — all incorrect assertions.""

She then cited GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan, who said, ""The pandemic brought us to our knees"" and pointed to production of U.S. oil which fell in the final months of the Trump presidency. De Haan also told the Times that Biden's actions on U.S. energy played a ""very, very small role pushing gas prices up.""

After writing global demand outpaced supply ""mostly attributable"" to OPEC's decision to limit increases in production and that the Russia-Ukraine conflict ""has only compounded the issues,"" Qiu summarized, ""These factors are largely out of Mr. Biden’s control, experts agreed, though they said he had not exactly sent positive signals to the oil and gas industry and its investors by vowing to reduce emissions and fossil fuel reliance."" BIDEN CLAIMS ‘NOT TRUE’ HE IS HOLDING BACK US ENERGY, WARNS RUSSIAN OIL BAN WILL COST AMERICANS Qiu touted the Biden administration's ""urging"" of American companies to ramp up energy production, citing comments in December from Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who told oil companies to ""please take advantage of the leases that you have, hire workers, get your rig count up."" She later highlighted that the Biden administration approved ""34 percent"" more energy permits than the Trump administration in its first year, according to the Center of Biological Diversity.    The Times fact-checker also dismissed claims U.S. had ""energy independence"" under Trump, pointing to Energy Information Administration's projection before he took office that the U.S. would become net energy exporter in the 2020s.

The reality is the U.S. oil production is actually up from 2020,"" the CNN host claimed, even though most of the country was shut down temporarily in 2020. Cabrera compared oil production during Trump’s first year in office, the lowest they were during his four years, to future projections of oil production during the next two years under Biden, based on the first three months of 2022 alone. She even suggested we would hit ""a new record"" in domestic oil production under Biden, a dubious claim considering several administration officials have  signaled their commitment to the renewable energy  over domestic oil production. ""And as you can see here, in Trump’s first year of office, the U.S. was producing 9.3 million barrels of oil per day. Well, now the U.S. is forecast to produce 12 million barrels per day and the experts say that production is on track to hit a new record next year,"" Cabrera announced. On screen was a graphic displaying U.S. field production of crude oil in average barrels a day since 2017. Cabrera also knocked conservatives criticizing the president for canceling the Keystone Pipeline as soon as he was inaugurated. She dismissed the pipeline as ""unlikely"" to have improved gas prices.   ""A third claim is that the Keystone Pipeline that, had it been approved, would help lower prices today. The reality here is that's up for debate but unlikely. The Keystone XL Pipeline would have been an extension of a currently operating pipeline it would have acted as a shortcut, taking oil extracted from the tar sands in Canada all the way to Nebraska, from there an existing pipeline would transport the oil to refineries along the Gulf Coast and this would've moved some about 830,000 barrels of oil out of Canada every day. And while it wouldn't have just been U.S.-owned oil, proponents of the pipeline argue buying more oil from Canada is preferable to, say, well, today for instance, Russia. Keep in mind though that the XL pipeline wasn’t expected to be operational until next year at the earliest,"" the CNN journalist said.

       Dunleavy urged Washington to again look north, not south, to power America. ""While not immediate, the Willow project in [the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska] is nearly shovel-ready and can provide a domestic source of oil,"" he said. ""Between the development of NPRA and the longer-term ‘1002 Area’ of ANWR, Alaska could place an additional 17 billion barrels of oil and an additional 32 trillion cubic feet of gas in the marketplace."" During his remarks at CPAC, Dunleavy noted that Russia is extracting ""massive amounts"" of Arctic oil and gas – while the U.S. government says Alaska cannot do the same. ""They're out there laughing all the way to the bank – we are enriching them we are making them more powerful [which can] jeopardize national security,"" he said, prior to the recent U.S. ban on Russian oil.

       Dunleavy stressed the importance of the oil and gas industry to his state and in providing significant revenue for the state budget. ""It’s clear that a ban on speculation on federal lands will keep us from resources that would benefit Alaskans and will hurt our economy,"" he said. ""It’s especially frustrating to see in areas where the federal government set aside an area specifically for energy development – like … the 1002 Area in ANWR."" While Democrats argue against drilling for domestic energy sources, Dunleavy told Fox News that communities in the vicinity of drilling sites often strongly support speculation, and rely heavily upon its revenue. ""In 2019, the North Slope Borough brought in [about] $394 million in property taxes from the oil industry. This consistent stream of revenue has allowed the NSB to build a new hospital, several community buildings, establish an elite search and rescue program complete with med-evac service, and establish an investment account fashioned after the Permanent Fund to generate revenue from investments and preserve wealth for future generations,"" he said. ""That investment account totaled over $900 million in 2019.""   Dunleavy said Biden's ban on new speculation on federal lands is actually counterproductive to the White House's own climate and environmental goals. Americans are not going to stop driving vehicles with internal combustion engines or using plastics overnight, he said. Oil products will need to be sourced from somewhere in the world, and it is better that they be sourced domestically and help fuel state economies and provide jobs here at home, the governor added. ""We think they should be coming from places like Alaska where there is robust regulatory oversight to ensure the total footprint is minimized,"" he said, alluding to comments he made at CPAC about how U.S. energy production standards are much cleaner than other countries with similarly high output.

""But, in the end, it’s also hamstringing the President’s own goals."" During his CPAC remarks, Dunleavy called the state of U.S. energy production a ""tale of two administrations.""

450,"With a history of cyberattacks, will Russia shift its vengeance to the United States?",Maria Lencki,2022-03-09 20:21:00,"  close     Video   Stream 'Russia: The Cyber Threat' exclusively on Fox Nation   A deep dive into Russia's longstanding history of cyberattacks, including new threats of cyber warfare that have arisen since the attack on Ukraine. Will Russia shift its vengeance to the United States? NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   As tensions continue to escalate in Ukraine, many express fears of Russia shifting its vengeance to the United States in the form of cyber warfare.  Fox Nation’s ""Russia: The Cyber Threat,"" hosted by Kelly O'Grady, details the dark side of cyber crimes and reveals how just ""a few highly calculated lines of code could cripple the infrastructure of an entire nation.""  In President Biden’s State of the Union address, he provided a stark warning to Russia, cautioning them to avoid attacking U.S. industries. However, as more and more countries step up in defense of Ukraine, many fear this means impending retaliation.  CHINA ACCUSES US OF ‘BIOLOGICAL MILITARY ACTIVITIES’ IN UKRAINE Russia – which, according to cybersecurity strategist Danielle Jablanski, is capable of ""the most sophisticated"" cyber attacks – has previously demonstrated its dark capabilities on several occasions.  Just weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 70 government websites were targeted with threatening messages to expect worse.   In 2015, Ukraine’s power grid was hit, leaving 230,000 residents without electricity. The hacker was able to gain remote control of the systems, effectively locking out the operator to shut off the power.   In another instance, malware spread to millions of computers worldwide after it was ""detonated on Ukraine’s financial sector,"" leading to $10 billion in damages.  Recently, Microsoft ""detected wiper malware aimed at Ukraine's government, ministries, and financial institutions,"" O’Grady explained. The company’s detection systems identified the malware and updated to block the infected code, which was later shared with surrounding countries out of caution.   ""Without defending against malware like wiper, what we would see is computers we use every day not be accessible, servers that we rely on to provide transactions, or banking, or news information not be available,"" cybersecurity expert Christian Sorensen explained.  While no threat of a cyber attack has yet been made against the United States, experts warn to be prepared. ""I think Vladimir Putin is already looking at, hey, how do we retaliate against the United States in the West?"" David Kennedy, cybersecurity expert and former hacker, told Fox Nation. ""We should definitely be prepared both on a critical infrastructure and financials, which are the two main areas that I think will be the first targets of us back here in the United States.""  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity division has previously responded to incidents that have impacted government agencies, infrastructure, and private sector organizations.   ""These hackers, later identified as members of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, used privileged access to collect and withdraw sensitive data, and even created backdoors to enable their return,"" O’Grady reported.  Russia is capable of disabling or even destroying U.S. satellites, according to cyber experts. This would affect Americans by impacting farming automation, GPS navigation, and oil exploration.  CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION   Though Russia has capabilities against America, the U.S. is also able to launch attacks of its own. In fact, experts admit they don’t believe Russia would risk engaging the U.S. in a cyber rwar. ""Whether Russia will engage in full-scale cyber warfare against Ukraine and its allies remains to be seen,"" O’Grady reflected. ""In modern warfare, all things are possible. One thing is certain: Russia is a cyber threat.""  To learn more about Russia's longstanding history of cyber attacks, subscribe to  Fox Nation  and watch 'Russia: The Cyber Threat.'   Fox Nation  programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.

   Russia’s  invasion of  Ukraine  has sent jitters across Taiwan, as military strategists and lawmakers prepare for the possibility – however far-reaching – of a similar invasion from mainland  China .  Last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft  entered  Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation.

       (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) Military strategists in Taiwan are closely studying Ukrainians as they've mounted a fierce resistance against a more formidable opponent despite being outgunned and outmanned.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES According to some  estimates , China spends more than $250 billion on its annual military budget, while Taiwan spends around $13 billion.  Still, the setback for Russia has been encouraging to many in Taiwan. Taiwanese lawmaker Lin Chu-Yin told Bloomberg this week that ""Putin’s war sends a signal to China that it won’t be as easy to take Taiwan as it imagines."" ""And it also breaks the myth that one can easily defeat another smaller or militarily weaker country with missiles,"" he said.

The announcement from the defense ministry came after Taiwan approved an extra $8.6 billion for military spending over the next five years.  CHINESE AMBASSADOR WARNS OF ‘MILITARY CONFLICT’ WITH US OVER TAIWAN Tensions were mounting between China and Taiwan well before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China has for decades regarded Taiwan as a renegade breakaway state.  Taiwan and China split in 1949 and China has been increasing pressure on the self-ruled nation, while opposing its involvement in international organizations. The U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan but maintains an unofficial alliance.

However, it's unclear how far these countries would be willing to go against China, given that it plays a more dominant role in the global economy.   Many leaders in Taiwan have also questioned how committed the U.S. would be if a conflict with Beijing were to escalate.  RUSSIA CONFIRMS USE OF THERMOBARIC ‘VACUUM BOMBS’ IN UKRAINE, UK SAYS ""If the world does not defend Taiwan, the whole order of things – especially in the Pacific – starts to change,"" retired CSM former Green Beret George Fraser told Fox News. ""After  Afghanistan  and Ukraine, what country would trust an alliance with the U.S. or any other western nation. China would rise as the strategic power in the region and be on its way to supplanting the U.S. in its position as a global leader.""  Still, others believe Beijing may be more apprehensive about any moves against Taiwan in the near future, given the chaotic effects of Russia's military aggression. The war has rattled stock markets and pushed  gas prices  to unprecedented levels.

   HOUSTON –  U.S.  nuclear  experts on Wednesday said people should be aware of the chance for nuclear disaster amid  Russia's  invasion of  Ukraine , but that one isn't necessarily likely, even as Chernobyl lost power and the Zaporizhzhia plant is also under Russian control.  ""People should be mindful but not fearful,"" Oregon State nuclear science and engineering professor Kathryn A. Higley told reporters at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.  ""I mean, we don't have any release going on,"" Higley continued. ""And folks also need to be aware that after Chernobyl, the European Union created a pretty robust data monitoring and sharing network to be able to address radioactive releases from any facilities across Europe."" UKRAINE'S CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DISCONNECTED FROM POWER GRID, SPARKING FEAR OF RADIATION LEAKS Higley made the comments at a press conference organized by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a group that promotes the use and expansion of nuclear energy globally, but particularly in the U.S. She was joined by NEI president and CEO Maria Korsnick and senior vice president for policy development and public affairs John Kotek.

       (BlackSky/Handout via REUTERS) Kotek and Korsnick emphasized that the design of Ukraine's several nuclear power plants is much safer than the design of Chernobyl. A reactor explosion at the Chernobyl plant in 1986 caused the worst nuclear disaster in world history.  Among the plants with a safer design is Zaporizhzhia, which is currently under control of Russian soldiers while it continues to be run by Ukrainian specialists. The plant was shelled by Russians last week.

       RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Korsnick said there's information indicating Russian soldiers are allowing Ukrainian operators to change shifts at the plant, which is a ""healthy"" sign. The NEI experts also said it's unlikely the power loss at Chernobyl will present a near-term threat because the fuel there is so old it may not be hot enough to cause significant problems.   ""At Chernobyl… the last reactor was shut down in the year 2000. So the spent fuel that's on site there has had 20 plus years to cool,"" Kotek said. ""I can point to a statement from the IAEA related to this just earlier today. They said that heat load of spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is sufficient for effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply."" The loss of power at Chernobyl is the third major incident that caused international nuclear fears to spike during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The first was the initial fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces at Chernobyl and the second was the shelling of Zaporizhzhia.

   The House of Representatives  voted to approve a $1.5. trillion spending bill that funds the government through Sept. 30 and includes $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine amid the war with Russia. The defense portion passed by a vote of 361-69, and the domestic portion passed by a vote of 260-171 with one present vote. The House voted after months of stalling and debate as Congress faced a Friday deadline to approve government funding or risk a shutdown. In an earlier version of the bill released early Wednesday morning, there was a $15 billion appropriation for pandemic relief. But because of internal friction among Democrats and opposition from Republicans, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was forced to push back the expected vote on the package and remove the COVID-19 funds. TOP LAWMAKERS REACH DEAL ON UKRAINE AID, $1.5T SPENDING As a result, Democrats missed their planned departure to  Philadelphia  on Wednesday for a conference retreat. Members told Fox News Digital that delays surrounding the bill had to do with major concerns about coronavirus funding, as well as defense spending levels and the short amount of time to review the contents of the 2,741-page measure just hours before they were expected to approve it.

       ""It is heartbreaking to remove the COVID funding, and we must continue to fight for urgently needed COVID assistance, but unfortunately that will not be included in this bill,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a Wednesday letter to her fellow Democrats.  ""Because of Republican insistence — and the resistance by a number of our Members to making those offsets — we will go back to the Rules Committee to remove COVID funding and accommodate the revised bill.  We must proceed with the omnibus today, which includes emergency funding for Ukraine and urgent funding to meet the needs of America’s families.""

   If you had told us just four days ago that the Biden administration was funding secret bio labs in Ukraine of all places, we would not have believed you. Yeah, I don't think we're going to put that on TV. No thanks.  Then, if you told us that not only did the administration fund these secret bio labs in Ukraine, but that they then failed to secure the deadly contents of those labs before the Russian invasion—an invasion they knew was coming, an invasion they helped encourage—if you had told us that four days ago, we would have dismissed you as a nut. It was just too preposterous. We will not want anything to do with a story like that. There was no way it could be true. It was too far out. In any case, we already knew for a fact that that story was false. How do we know that? Because we read USA Today, America's newspaper.   Within hours of the  Russian invasion , USA Today published a rebuttal to all those crazies who were yammering on about secret Ukrainian bio labs.

These were not exactly objective sources on this subject, but still the story seemed definitive. It was totally emphatic. ""Russia has teamed up with China to further amplify the false claim of U.S. labs in Ukraine.""     OK. USA Today says it's Russian disinformation. Maybe it is. On to the next story, but the fact checks didn't stop. That was weird. We kept seeing the same check again and again. It was almost like despite endless official clarification, some people refused to believe the Biden administration. They preferred Russian propaganda instead and we assume they must be QAnon members. We assume that because Foreign Policy Magazine told us that. According to Foreign Policy, QAnon, whatever that is, was frantically disseminating ""false claims of U.S. bio warfare labs in Ukraine.""     Those labs obviously didn't exist. It was all just another lie from the Russians who lie for a living. Then the European Union... weighed in, throwing its credibility behind the same claim. These are conspiracy theories, the EU told us, they're lies spread by Putin. An EU spokesmen then reminded us that, ""the credibility of information provided by the Kremlin is in general, very doubtful and low."" That was good to know.   ""Russian disinformation has a track record of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged secret labs.""     Yeah. We're not going to do a segment about secret labs in Ukraine. Last thing we want to do on this show is traffic in Russian disinformation spread by QAnon, so we took a pass on that story.

       (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Try not to use profanity on the air to describe our reaction. Our jaws dropped, let's leave it there. Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Nuland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral to believe is, in fact, totally and completely true.   Woah, you don't hear things like that every day in Washington. Talk about a showstopper and a dozen questions instantly jump to mind. What exactly are they doing in these secret Ukrainian bio labs? Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these weren't pharmaceutical labs, probably not developing new Leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, we would assume because you all but said it, that there's a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons. Again, your answer suggests that.   Why would we fund something like that in Ukraine, and why didn't you secure the contents of these bio labs before the Russians arrived as you knew they would? And then why did you go out of your way to lie to the American public about all of this? If the ""research materials"" in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world? How can we prepare for the consequences of that, this thing that you're worried about? Shouldn't we be preparing? Because as it turns out, we've just spent the last two years living with the pathogen that began in another foreign bio lab funded by the United States government secretly.   So, this question is on our mind. It seems fair. Now that's some of what we would have asked if we were U.S. Senators, which were not. Yes, there's a time limit. Time limit be damned because this is kind of important, but Rubio did not ask those questions. Instead, he changed the subject and told us once again that  Vladimir Putin  is bad.  SEN. MARCO RUBIO: If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or... attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100%, it would be the Russians that would be behind it?   VICTORIA NULAND:  There is no doubt in my mind, senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves.   US NUCLEAR EXPERTS ‘MINDFUL BUT NOT FEARFUL’ OF RADIOACTIVE THREAT AMID RUSSIA INVASION OF UKRAINE       
      Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at The Rosen Shingle Creek on Feb. 25, 2022, in Orlando, Florida. 
       (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) OK, just get a pen. It's a classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy, what they are planning to do themselves. That's what Toria Nuland said. We almost laughed out loud. So, what you're saying, Toria Nuland, if, for example, you were funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but wanted to hide that fact from the people who are paying for it, in whose name you were doing it, then you might lie about it by claiming the Russians were lying about it. In other words, you might mount a disinformation campaign by claiming the other guy was mounting a disinformation campaign. Is that what you're saying, Toria Nuland? It's pretty funny.   What's not funny is that this is all entirely real. We invited Marco Rubio on the show tonight to tell us what he knows about these bio labs. He declined to come. That invitation remains open. In the meantime, let's review what little we do know about this. We're going to start with a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday. Now, we would never do this. We never played anything like this on the show before because of course, we're Americans and when we want to know what's going on we ask our own officials, the people we elect and whose salaries we pay, because it's our country.   We don't go to foreign sources because we trust our own sources first. But when it turns out the people who represent us and run our government are lying to us and never apologize for it and doing horrific things in our names, then you have to open your mind a little bit and at least assess what other people are saying. So, here was the Russian claim.   IGOR KONASHENKOV: During the course of the special military operation, facts were uncovered of the key regime, mopping up traces of military biological program under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry.   OK. So, that apparently—we hadn't seen that until this afternoon we started poking around—that may have been the root of the conspiracy theories that the fact checks told us were Russian disinformation. Let's quote it: ""Military biological programs are under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry."" That's the Russian claim.   Separately, a  Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman said the Ukrainians were working on deadly pathogens, including plague and anthrax. Is that true? Now, obviously, we would not take Russia's word for that ever, but we don't have to take Russia's word for that. The U.S. Defense Department has a website that contains this media clip about the opening of a biological research facility in Ukraine in 2010.   RUSSIA CONFIRMS USE OF THERMOBARIC ‘VACUUM BOMBS’ IN UKRAINE, UK SAYS       
      Chief of the Media Service and Information Directorate of the Russian Defence Ministry, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, gives a press briefing on the situation in the Idlib buffer zone in Syria. 
       (Vadim SavitskyTASS via Getty Images) ""U.S. Senator Dick Lugar applauded the opening of the Interim Central Reference Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, this week, announcing that it will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists. The level-3 bio-safety lab will be used to study anthrax, tularemia and Q Fever, as well as other dangerous pathogens.""     Oh, OK. Then the National Pulse dug up 2011 report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences that also explained that the Odessa based laboratory ""is responsible for the identification of especially dangerous biological pathogens."" So, what we're doing—this is not the first time you've heard this story—we are funding the creation of deadly pathogens so we can study them and prevent people from getting infected with them. Maybe? There are lots of examples of this. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has a handy web page explaining that American and Ukrainian scientists have worked on a whole bunch of different experiments like this.   Some of the projects include work on African swine fever virus, hemorrhagic fever virus, and various respiratory viruses. The interesting thing, the telling thing, is that the U.S. Embassy's website also contains links to fact sheets about America's support for biological research in Ukraine, but all those links are now dead. That's weird. It's our government. We pay for it. Again, they're there in our name, in the name of American citizens, but we can no longer read their web page. How does that work, exactly? They have no right to lie to us.   The web page is archived, thankfully, and the fact sheets show Defense Department funding to laboratories in Ukraine. So that looks like proof. It's not Russian disinformation. It's totally real. Sorry USA Today, America's newspaper, it's real. You can look it up on the internet if you want. In the face of that evidence, the Pentagon is still lying about and in fact, they're repeating the same unbelievably stupid and now thoroughly discredited lies the fact checkers have told for weeks now. Here's the spokesman for the  Pentagon , John Kirby, today.   JOHN KIRBY:  The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable and, you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda and I wouldn't, if I were you,...I wouldn't give it a drop of ink worth...paying attention to.   REPORTER: Yeah, but can you explain to us what...has there been any relationship between the...?   JOHN KIRBY:  We are not, not, developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine. It's not happening.   US REJECTS POLISH PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER MIG-29 PLANES TO UKRAINE, CALLS MOVE ‘HIGH-RISK.’     Video If I were you, I wouldn't devote a drop of ink to it. First of all, you didn't get to make that decision, Mr. Bureaucrat. We have a free press in this country. You don't get to decide, but you'll notice at the end of that, Kirby refuses to answer the question. Has there been any relationship between the U.S. Pentagon and a bioweapons facility in Ukraine and if so, what is that relationship? That's Russian disinformation! What's the answer? We're not developing WMD in Ukraine right now! OK, got it, but why are we funding this and what exactly are we funding?   We reached out to the State Department separately and they provided us with this very carefully worded statement: ""The U.S. Department of Defense does not own or operate biological laboratories in Ukraine."" Not that anyone said they did. Continuing the quote, ""Undersecretary Nuland was referring to Ukrainian diagnostic and biodefense laboratories during her testimony, which are not biological weapons facilities."" What's the difference exactly? Continuing the quote, ""These institutions counter biological threats throughout the country.""  So that means nothing. You could describe our nuclear stockpile correctly as defensive. Our nuclear weapons are not designed to preemptively kill anybody. They're designed to prevent other people from killing us, but they're still nuclear weapons. So, when you stop lying and telling us what's going on here and why don't you more specifically tell us why you didn't secure these materials? So, yes, we're funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but they are diagnostic and biodefense laboratories that counter biological threats.   OK, if these are purely defensive labs, why was Toria Nuland so concerned that Russians would get ahold of the materials from these facilities? Other world powers have come to the obvious conclusion. Again, we hate to do this, but under these circumstances, we asked our own spokespeople, they lied. We're going to the  Foreign Ministry of China , a country we despise. Here's what they said today. They're calling on weapons inspectors to take a look at these facilities in Ukraine right away.   ZHAO LIJIAN: Over the past two decades, the United States has been blocking the establishment of a verification regime to the Biological Weapons Convention and refused to accept the inspection of biological facilities within and outside its borders. The move has further aggravated the concern of the international community. We, once again, urge the U.S. to provide full clarification of its bio militarization activities within and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   Video Oh, they're putting Russian and Chinese propaganda on the screen! Yeah, we did. We also put U.S. government propaganda on the screen and the difference is we expect to be lied to by foreign governments. We're not globalists. We believe in one country. It's this country, the United States. We do not expect to be lied to by our government and we won't accept it. But let's get to the substance of what the Chinese government just said. We never agree with the Chinese government on anything, but in this case, they make a fair point. We now know that dangerous biological agents, whether you call them weapons or not is completely irrelevant because they can be used as weapons. Is a gun a weapon? Not when you're quail hunting. When you're in a gunfight, it is. It's a ridiculous semantic debate.   Dangerous biological agents remain, thanks to the Biden administration, unsecured in a chaotic war zone. At some point we need to know how that happened, who made those decisions. We have a right to know and let's hope someone in Congress, probably not Marco Rubio, but someone else, will get to the bottom of it, but in the meantime, we pray that somewhere, in the United States government, there as an adult who cares enough to get this situation under control immediately.  This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the March 9, 2022 edition of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

   SEOUL, South Korea — Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative former top prosecutor and foreign policy neophyte,  was elected South Korea’s president  in a win expected to herald a drive to seek a stronger alliance  with the United States  and take a tougher line on North Korea. With over 99% of the votes counted early Thursday, Yoon from the main opposition People Power Party had 48.6% against ruling liberal Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung’s 47.8%. It was South Korea’s most closely fought presidential election. A crowd of supporters gathered near Yoon’s house and his party’s campaign office, shouting his name in celebration. ""This is the victory of our great people,"" Yoon said in his victory speech at the party office. ""I would respect our constitution and parliament and work together with the opposition party to serve our people properly."" IMAGES ALLEGEDLY SHOW CONSTRUCTION AT NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR FACILITY THOUGHT TO BE DESTROYED Yoon is to take office in May and serve a single five-year term as leader of  the world’s 10th largest economy . Earlier, Lee, a former governor of Gyeonggi province, conceded his defeat at his party headquarters. ""I did my best but wasn’t able to live up to expectations,"" a glum Lee said. ""I congratulate candidate Yoon Suk Yeol. I sincerely ask the president-elect to overcome division and conflicts and open a new era of unity and harmony."" Two-way showdown Wednesday's election boiled down to a two-way showdown between Yoon and Lee, who spent months slamming, mocking and demonizing each other in one of the most bitter political campaigns in recent memory. Their fighting aggravated already severe domestic divisions and stoked speculation the losing candidate might face criminal probes over scandals that they’ve been linked to. After winning the election, Yoon said his race with Lee and other contenders has improved South Korean politics. ""Our competition is over for now. We should combine our strengths and become one for our people,"" he said.     
      SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - MARCH 10: South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk Yeol of the main opposition People Power Party celebrates with supporters at the party's headquarters on March 10, 2022 in Seoul, South Korea. 
       (Getty Images) Critics say neither Yoon nor Lee has presented a clear strategy for how they would ease the threat from North Korea and its nuclear weapons. They also say voters are skeptical about how both would handle international relations amid the U.S.-China rivalry and how they would address widening economic inequality and runaway housing prices. Yoon says he would sternly deal with North Korean provocations and seek to boost trilateral security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo to neutralize North Korean nuclear threats. He has made it clear that an enhanced alliance with the United States would be the center of his foreign policy. Yoon said he would take a more assertive stance on China. Lee, for his part, had called for greater reconciliation with North Korea and a diplomatic pragmatism amid the U.S.-China confrontations. Closer to Washington? Some experts say Yoon’s foreign policy stance would put Seoul closer to Washington but he cannot avoid frictions with Pyongyang and Beijing. ""We can expect the alliance to run more smoothly and be in sync for the most part on North Korea, China, and regional and global issues,"" said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at Washington’s Center for a New American Security. ""Yoon’s key challenge is whether he will listen to his advisers and whether he’s able to really be tougher toward North Korea and China when he’s faced with political and geo-economic realities after he’s in office."" ""Yoon’s key challenge is whether he will listen to his advisers and whether he’s able to really be tougher toward North Korea and China when he’s faced with political and geo-economic realities after he’s in office.""   —  Duyeon Kim, senior analyst, Center for a New American Security Yoon had been current liberal President Moon Jae-in's prosecutor general but resigned and joined the opposition last year following infighting over probes of Moon’s allies. Yoon said those investigations were objective and principled, but Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing. Yoon’s critics have attacked him over a lack of experience in party politics, foreign policy and other key state affairs. Yoon has responded he would let experienced officials handle state affairs that require expertise.

       (Reuters) On domestic issues, Yoon was accused of stoking gender animosities by adopting a Trump-like brand of divisive identity politics that spoke almost exclusively to men. He vowed to abolish the country’s Gender Equality and Family Ministry in an apparent bid to win the votes of young men who decry gender equality policies and the loss of traditional privileges in a hyper-competitive job market. Coronavirus response An immediate priority for Yoon would be to contain an unprecedented wave in  omicron-driven coronavirus infections , which has erased the country’s hard-won pandemic gains. South Korea’s health authorities reported a record 342,446 new virus cases on Wednesday. Hospitalizations and deaths have also been creeping up. Healing the country’s deepened divide along the lines of ideology, regional loyalties and gender would be a crucial task for Yoon. He may otherwise face huge impasses in his domestic agenda and struggle to push forward his major policies confronting a parliament still controlled by Lee’s party.

       (Associated Press) Yoon has promised to launch a coalition government with Ahn Cheol-soo, another conservative candidate who pulled out of the race last week to throw his support behind him. While Ahn’s withdrawal was believed to have contributed to Yoon’s victory, there are still worries about factional feuding among Ahn and Yoon’s associates, observers say. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP South Korea’s constitution limits a president to a single five-year term, so Moon could not seek reelection. Moon came to power in 2017 after conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from office over a huge corruption scandal. With conservatives initially in shambles after Park’s fall, Moon’s approval rating at one point hit 83% as he pushed hard to achieve reconciliation with North Korea and delve into alleged corruption by past conservative leaders. He eventually faced strong backlash as talks on North Korea’s nuclear program faltered and his anti-corruption drive raised questions of fairness. The tentative voter turnout was 77.1%, the fifth highest ever since the country restored direct presidential elections in 1987 following decades of military dictatorship, according to the National Election Commission.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The  Ukraine crisis  may be a story of Russian aggression, but the preamble is the Biden administration’s total failure to strengthen America industrially and economically, rally the West, bolster NATO, and deter Vladimir Putin. Weeks of sanction threats didn’t stop Putin. Rather,  President Biden’s teleprompter sermons  provided time for the amassing of offensive forces on the Ukraine border.   Video I attended the Munich Security Conference in late February, along with a bipartisan array of my  House and Senate colleagues . The administration was there, too, but provided nothing close to definitive policy. The clearest statements they made publicly or privately were that if you are an American citizen in Ukraine and find yourself trapped in a war zone, well, you’re on your own. BIDEN'S FAILURES BY THE NUMBERS – ENERGY COSTS, POLL NUMBERS TELL THE STORY The culmination of this White House’s missteps: A 65-minute phone call between Biden and Putin. Less than two weeks later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and the killing began. Biden’s response? A lot of words. Some at high volume. Others at a low whisper. But the out-loud contemplation of sanctions is a poor substitute for leading the nation and world.

       (Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Many thought the State of the Union Address would be different. It wasn’t. It was empty cheerleading. Take Biden’s full-throated assurance that Putin ""will never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people."" We know he meant to say ""Ukrainian"" people. But the statement makes no more sense with the correction. Who can possibly think at this point that Putin is trying to win the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people? He’s trying to take their country and their freedom. I’ve attended 17 State of the Union addresses. I’ve never seen one that was followed by less action from a White House. It’s now been seven days since Biden’s national address. No legislation. No Cabinet-level Hill consultation. No bipartisan White House gathering. The Biden administration had already plunged this country into an energy crisis before Putin mobilized soldiers for this invasion of Ukraine.   This brings us to Tuesday’s announcement by President Biden to restrict Russian energy imports weeks after my colleagues and I urged him to do so. The policy move is fine, but his remarks were defensive, divisive and, quite frankly, dishonest. He did not in any way advance the national interest or our international standing. And it is simply not true – as he said – that this administration is doing all it can to lessen the pain that Americans are feeling at the pump, from their utility bills, and in their inflation-battered pocketbooks. It’s dishonest for the White House to link the inflation its policies skyrocketed – and the gas prices it drove up just as fast – to the crisis in Ukraine. This is a naked attempt to offload its failures onto what it hopes will be a sharing of blame with others.   Video The truth is, the Biden administration had already plunged this country into an energy crisis before Putin mobilized soldiers for this invasion of Ukraine. From his first days in office, President Biden stopped energy infrastructure and sent an unmistakable message to the energy industry: no to pipelines, no to drilling, no to the financing of oil and gas projects. This was a stunning reversal of the energy independence policies that were working when he took office as oil production exceeded consumption for most of 2019 and 2020.

This is one thing that when we talk about getting clean energy in this country everyone says, ‘Oh, here go the environmentalists again,’ This is why we have to get off. It's not sustainable,"" Haines said.  ""It makes us dependent on the Middle East. It makes us dependent on places like Russia,"" she continued. ""If people don’t get serious about the fact that's not an environmental issue, it’s an economic issue, it’s a national security issue.""  MSNBC GUEST: HIGH GAS PRICES WILL FORCE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT ‘THE TRUTH’ OF GREEN ENERGY CNN: ‘OK with paying higher prices’ CNN’s Vanessa Yurkevich said on Tuesday that Americans are ""OK"" with spending more at the pump if it ""holds Russia accountable"" for invading Ukraine.  ""If you look at it globally, if the European Union decides to do something similar as to what President Biden is going to be doing in his announcement,"" she said prior to Biden’s official announcement.  ""Stopping all Russian imports and energy into the country. That could have a significant ripple effect on the global energy market, then pushing prices here at home at the pump a lot higher,"" Yurkevich said. ""People we’ve spoken to over the last couple weeks, they’re OK with paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for what they are doing in Ukraine."" When Biden announced the ban on Russian oil, he also defended his environmental policies and regulations that obstructed domestic oil production.  ""It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production, that’s simply not true,"" Biden stated.

""He also made it clear… that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country. He wanted to make that clear, too,"" King said.  CBS senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang then cited the White House's excuses, blaming oil companies instead of Biden’s policies.

Well, the president just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they aren’t taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said that’s exactly right,"" Jiang said. ‘Wind’ from Bette Midler Far-left actress Bette Midler  tweeted , ""Since the Russian invasion, the cost to produce wind energy has gone up $0.00,"" prompting critics to explain to the privileged actress that cars cannot run on wind.  ""Show me the cars and airplanes and trucks and trains that can use wind power. And apparently it does not cost anything to build the windmills and infrastructure to harness the energy,"" conservative pundit Carmine Sabia  responded .  Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson feels the Green agenda is a ""danger to our national security"" itself. ""Maybe decades from now we will have the technology to replace fossil fuels, but until then it is reckless to leave ourselves vulnerable. The Green agenda also is elitist, ignoring the costs imposed on working class people from higher gasoline and heating sources,"" Jacobson told Fox News Digital. ‘Significant, of course’ Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki continued to shield Biden from fuel-related criticism Wednesday as she was grilled on whether Americans simply need to wait until 2030 – the year that Biden has set a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions – in order to combat gas surges.  ""No, that has never been our theory or our belief, I would say that since President Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian border, the price of gas at the pump in America has gone up 75 cents, which is significant, of course,"" Psaki said during a news briefing.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Psaki said it is widely believed that the buildup of Putin’s troops along the Ukraine border has caused many of the issues that occurred during Biden’s time in the White House.  ""The reality, as you know, is that Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer and energy supply disruptions and market volatility are the result of his aggressions,"" she continued. ""We need to ensure the supply meets the demand out there in the marketplace. There's a couple of ways to do that. Obviously, we're engaging with big global oil producers around the world to meet that demand. But there are also, as we've talked about a few times in here, 9,000 unused oil leases that oil companies could certainly tap into. And we've encouraged them to do that.""

       The patriarch of Constantinople serves as the first among equals of the decentralized Eastern Orthodox communion. He presides over any council of Orthodox primates, and he serves as a spokesperson for the Orthodox communion. When Ukraine gained its independence from the former Soviet Union, the Ecumenical Patriarch said the Orthodox church also granted the country its own independent Orthodox Church. In 2019, a Ukrainian Orthodox Church based in Kyiv formally separated from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that looks to Moscow for leadership. Both churches, however, have garnered criticism from Russia's Orthodox Church. RUSSIAN VICTORY IN UKRAINE WOULD BE 'COMPLETE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CATASTROPHE,' HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER WARNS The head of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, has voiced support for Putin and even went as far as to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war against sinful living and in response to the ""extermination"" of Donbas separatists. ""We have entered into a struggle that has not a physical, but a metaphysical significance,"" Kirill said during a church sermon on Sunday, before the start of Lent.

   Thursday’s high-level talks in  Turkey  between Ukrainian and  Russian  foreign affairs counterparts ended in no progress for a potential cease-fire or for protecting civilians in the heavily bombarded Mariupol, even after  Ukraine  suggested a ""neutrality"" proposal with security guarantees from world powers.  In the most senior interaction since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the failed talks between Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and his counterpart, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, lasted just 90 minutes in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya.  Russia reportedly rejected Ukraine’s ""neutrality"" proposals that promised international security guarantees, according to the Financial Times.

       (AP Photo) ""Unfortunately, I can confirm that the Russian leadership, including Minister Lavrov, live in their own reality,"" Kuleba told  CNBC  on Thursday. ""In our talks, behind closed doors and in the absence of the media, he told me looking in my eyes that the pictures of pregnant women being taken from under the rubble of the maternity house are fake, that they hit the maternity house as a military target because the Russian military was absolutely sure that it was under the control of Ukrainian army.""  Kuleba said he came the talks with a ""humanitarian"" purpose to establish evacuation corridors for civilians looking to flee the devastation in Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces for days.  ""Unfortunately, Minister Lavrov was not in position to commit himself to it, but he will correspond with respective authorities,"" he said. In Mariupol, hundreds have died, and workers hurried to bury some of the bodies in a mass grave. Those who have survived have been breaking into shops for food and resorting to melting snow for drinking water, as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces have blocked a convoy with food and medicine. Lavrov claimed that Russia ""did not attack Ukraine,"" the Financial Times reported, and that everything was ""going according to plan"" regarding Russia’s military operation in the country. He also repeated unsubstantiated allegations that Ukraine was creating bioweapons at its border with help from the U.S., claims which the White House said are ""preposterous.""

(Fox News) Duda said that Poland and its allies ""accept"" that Ukraine has ""the right to demand this assistance from the international community.""  Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  on Wednesday pleaded with the U.S. and Poland to find a way to send his country MiG-29 warplanes as Russian forces continue to pummel Ukraine. With regard to those demands, Duda said he is making decisions ""not only through our own lens of Poland,"" but also is looking to ""adopt in the perspective of the security of NATO as a whole.""    Video ""In a nutshell, we have to be a member of the alliance,"" he said, adding that in receiving requests from Ukraine, and ""the media,"" Poland ""behaved in such a way as a reliable member of NATO should serve NATO, who does not want to expose NATO to any difficult situation.""  Duda stressed that as a member of NATO, Poland ""wanted to look for ways of support for the fighting of its allies.""  ""And that is why we formulated that statement together with the Polish government and myself as president, together, with the Polish government,"" he said, adding that the statement discussed ""the Polish civilities military support of assisting Ukraine.""  ""Simply, we decided to put those jets at the disposal of NATO's not expecting anything in return because we stressed very clearly that as a gap-filler for the donated equipment we are able to buy what we would need as a replacement,"" Duda said. ""And we, ourselves, were ready to do that and provide our equipment free of charge and that we wanted NATO, as a whole, to make a common decision so that Poland remains a member of NATO, not a country who decides on its own on important issues, which impact the security of NATO's help, which would impact this initiative of all members of NATO. Also, our neighbors who are part of NATO, members of NATO.""  Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Department of Defense believes the ""best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular anti-armor and air defense."" PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS Kirby said previous weapons sent to Ukraine from America and other nations are being ""used with great effect."" He said a defense assessment showed that ""adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities."" ""Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MiG 29s is low,"" Kirby said. ""The intelligence community has assessed that the transfer of MiG-29s may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" Kirby said. ""Therefore, we also assess the MiG-29s to Ukraine to be high-risk."" Ukraine has been pleading with Western allies to send military aid and implement a no-fly zone over the country.

   With gas and oil prices reaching record levels and the United States recently banning  Russian energy imports , many are concerned as to how  Russia's invasion of Ukraine  will continue to affect the global energy market.  Fox Nation 's new special ‘ Energy Shock: The Coming Energy Crisis ,' delivers insight into how the conflict is wreaking havoc on global energy prices and why Putin's most potent weapon is energy. In ' Energy Shock: The Coming Energy Crisis ,' available to stream now on the app, FOX Business host  Stuart Varney  explains how the energy crisis did not happen overnight and takes a step back to assess the events that led to this point. RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES In the  special , Varney breaks down how, for several years, Putin has been working to make Europe dependent on Russia - who, by building the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline , would double the amount of oil volume they can send directly to Germany without having to move across Ukraine.  In doing so, Russia became a ‘giant gas station with imperial ambitions,’ as described by the  ‘Varney & Co.’  host.

       ((Photo by ALEXEI NIKOLSKY/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)) Putin also recognized that the West needed his energy; so he tightened the supply, anticipating that if he attacked Ukraine, the West would respond with sanctions. According to Varney, the Russian president hedged his bets. Though critics have been quick to blame President Biden’s  domestic energy policies  as a self-inflicted wound leading up to Putin's war, America's ban on Russian oil will drive prices at the pump even higher, said Varney, which 'presents us with a monumental inflation problem.’ CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION   Video Throughout the  special , Varney dives into the mind of  Vladimir Putin  and his longstanding strategy to create a Russian energy juggernaut to withstand what he was planning to do all along.  ""Putin's war has made us all realize the virtues of democracy and freedom,"" said Varney.

   A bipartisan group of 21 House members, including 11 Democrats, has many questions for  President Biden  about a potential new  Iran  nuclear deal, as reports of a possible agreement have them worried that it is not strong enough. In a  letter  to Biden dated Thursday, the group, led by Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Tom Reed, R-N.Y., said they have been waiting for the Biden administration to enter into an agreement that was ""stronger"" than the original Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached by President Barack Obama, but that information being reported has them doubting whether this will happen. FORMER DNI RIPS BIDEN ON IRAN DEAL: HE'S WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND DEAL WITH A ‘TERRORIST REGIME’ ""Among other issues, we are highly concerned about reports indicating the potential lifting of the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and of the sanctions placed on members of the office of the Supreme Leader,"" the letter said.   Video ""Without adequately addressing Iran’s role as the world’s leading state-sponsor of terror – which was noticeably absent from the 2015 JCPOA – and simultaneously providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief, the United States would be providing a clear path for Iranian proxies to continue fueling terrorism,"" the letter continued. The House members went on to say that ""it is hard to envision supporting an agreement along the lines being publicly discussed,"" and that their ""support is largely contingent on satisfactory answers"" to a list of 16 questions they posed to Biden.   Video Those questions cover subjects including details regarding whether the U.S. will lift or lessen sanctions against Iran's supreme leader, the IRGC or Iran's Central Bank; how much money Iran would immediately receive upon the execution of a new deal; and what Iran's projected breakout time would be to develop a nuclear weapon at the time of the deal and at different points in the deal's future, through the year 2031. GOP SENATORS SLAM BIDEN FOR WORKING WITH RUSSIA ON IRAN DEAL DURING UKRAINE INVASION: ‘INSANE’ The members of Congress also asked about what kind of role Russia would play, both in terms of any money the Kremlin might receive under the deal, and if they would be the ones to make a ruling if Iran claims the deal has been broken. ""In essence, will Vladimir Putin become the de facto judge of compliance with an agreement?"" the letter asked, questioning whether Russia would be able to return enriched uranium should they determine the deal is broken.

   A top  Iranian resistance group  is warning that any move to take the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps off the U.S. Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list will ""heighten terrorism and mayhem"" in the region, amid fears the Biden administration will make such a move as part of  negotiations to bring Iran back  into the 2015 nuclear deal. ""A potential IRGC exclusion from the FTO list and taking these individuals off the terror blacklist, as requested by Iran’s ruling theocracy, will no doubt heighten terrorism and mayhem in the region,""  the report  by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), released Thursday, said.

The designation was put in place by the Trump administration in 2019, which also launched a strike to take out IRGC’s Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who headed up its paramilitary Quds Forces.

       Israel’s prime minister  said last month  Iran is making the demand, adding that Iran is ""now asking to let the biggest terror organization on earth off the hook."" The report by the NCRI, which calls for a secular, democratic and non-nuclear Iran, said the designation ""handicapped many of the IRGC-related foreign financial transactions."" The report outlines the IRGC’s work in military and terrorist operations in other countries in the region, via proxies, and the training of foreign mercenaries in places like Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. It also outlines allegations it funded Hamas, and also looked to organize assassination attempts on U.S. soil. It supports the NCRI’s previous reports about the IRGC’s use of drones and naval proxies.   Video ""The IRGC’s involvement in research & development of weapons of mass destruction, ceaseless terrorist activities to foment mayhem, destruction and instability across the Middle East, its financial empire to fund its nefarious activities inside Iran and abroad, make this terror outfit a serious global threat,"" the report says. It also outlines how the IRGC is used against the Iranian people, particularly after uprisings from dissidents have shaken the regime’s grip on power, in order to project an image of its own strength onto the people. The group warns that the outreach and JCPOA talks by the U.S. and its allies have only served to embolden the regime in Tehran’s terrorist activities. ""The continued offers of concessions by Western countries and lack of accountability for the regime’s terrorism, have emboldened Tehran to step up its terrorism in the region,"" Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI’s Washington office, said with the release of the report. IRAN DISSIDENTS WARN OF REGIME'S USE OF DRONES TO ‘DESTABILIZE’ REGION, USING MATERIALS FROM CHINA  Jafarzadeh warned that any move to pull the FTO designation from the IRGC would be ""counterproductive at best."" ""Instead of holding the regime accountable for its stepped-up terrorism, the West would be rewarding terrorism, leading to even more violence,"" he said, arguing instead that more sanctions are warranted due to the regime’s continued terrorist activities in the region.

   With  COVID-19  cases, hospitalizations and deaths falling around the U.S., more cities and states have moved to lift pandemic restrictions this week.  On Wednesday, officials in  Los Angeles  took steps to end requirements patrons to show proof of full  vaccination  at certain businesses. The Los Angeles City Council  ordered  the city attorney to devise an ordinance that makes vaccine verification voluntary for indoor businesses, like bars and gyms.  CDC DIRECTOR EXPECTS COVID-19 TO BECOME A 'SEASONAL VIRUS' It also eliminates proof of vacation requirements for large outdoor events.  Proof of vaccination or a negative test will continue to be required to attend indoor ""mega-events,"" or gatherings with 1,000 or more attendees.  A final vote will be taken when the ordinance is introduced at a future council meeting, although there was no immediate indication of when that would occur.

   As Russia enters week three of a  full-scale invasion of Ukraine , many are already calling this the Second Cold War. Others are saying the first never ended. But what we are seeing today is entirely different: a new war for a new era, and one that is unlikely to end anytime soon.  Much like we never imagined hijackers flying planes into buildings in New York, or that the  Taliban could seize Kabul  in a week, most people never imagined that a major world power would embark on the largest invasion since  World War II  to take over a sovereign nation just because its autocratic leader felt like it. IN UKRAINIAN CRISIS, CHINA IS PART OF PROBLEM. DOES EUROPE GET IT? However this ends, we cannot make the mistake – again – of believing that Putin will stop here. We’re witnessing the first days of a new world order, and as Lincoln once said, ""As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.""   Video What lies ahead is not another Cold War nor, we all hope, a wide-scale hot war – a full-blown World War III. Instead, it’s what might best be termed a Warm War, and we need to be better prepared to fight it. The Warm War includes elements of Cold War brinkmanship like we’ve seen between Putin and the West over the past several months; it includes elements of hot war like we see now in Ukraine; and it includes large-scale cyber attacks, mass dis-information campaigns, and an ungoverned future of weapons enabled by artificial intelligence – all of which fall somewhere in between.   Video This Warm War is more dangerous than the Cold War because it is less black and white. It has the same worst consequence of a nuclear holocaust, yet the lines are less clear, so the chances of miscalculation are higher. And the daily impact on our lives is more substantial. Even at the height of the Cold War, we never imagined Russia intervening in a U.S. election by spreading lies directly to American voters. Unlike the Cold War, at its core this is not a battle of economic systems. By most measures, every country in the world today is a capitalist country aside from North Korea. Some are more directed by the state (China) or undermined by corruption (Russia), but nobody holds out hope for genuine Soviet-style communism or Leninist socialism. This is not a battle of economics but of governance: democracy versus autocracy. It’s the rule of law versus tyrants.    No, this is not a battle of economics but of governance: democracy versus autocracy. It’s the rule of law versus tyrants. These are the battle lines between NATO and Russia, between America and China. Autocracy, paired with a deep fear of democracy itself, is what brings Russia and China together. Two countries with vastly different economies and cultures have found common ground in common enemies: America and freedom. And the autocrats are winning – or at least they have been gaining over the past decade. Not only have Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin dramatically consolidated domestic control and entrenched their tyrannical systems of governance, but they are aggressively exporting authoritarianism in what has already become a global struggle.   Video In the 20th century, America committed fervently to spreading freedom and democracy. Everything from development in Africa, to Radio Free Europe, to a misbegotten war in Vietnam, was part of spreading democracy and stopping communism. Nobody questioned America’s fundamental commitment. Today, they do. Our credibility is waning. Isolationists on both the right and the left, with the political division these same extremists stoke at home, have caused the United States to turn inward and withdraw from the world. In our global absence, China and Russia have extended their horizons, recognizing that America’s greatest strength has always been our allies. Through a complex set of exports from Chinese surveillance technology to Russian mercenaries, Xi and Putin are working hard to pull them away.   Video The question, therefore, is what is our response? It must involve not only a new set of tactics and technologies to keep the American people safe at home and the West safe for democracy, but also a new grand strategy. Let’s admit this: NATO is united, but our current posture has not stopped Putin yet. We have to re-evaluate our fundamental strategy for deterrence. More troops and tanks in Poland won’t change NATO’s efficacy any more than increasing defense spending on the same old things we already have. Neither is thinking anew. We don’t currently have a strategy because, high off our Cold War victory, too many of us were content resting on our laurels. But we can’t beat Chinese robotic drones if we don’t develop better ones. We can’t beat Russian dis-information if we simply sit back and hope the truth will prevail. (It may eventually, but the autocrats will eat our lunch first.)   Video This is the most important work in national security today, and our new grand strategy should rest on three principles: military supremacy for a new era of warfare; new arms control treaties so that we and our allies set the rules of the road; and new alliances to counter a new generation of adversaries. And while containment was enough for the Cold War, the Warm War requires more active measures. For too long, we’ve only played defense as Xi and Putin work to undermine the post-World War II order. It’s time for us to undermine them. Cyber attacks must be met not just with defense but with offensive cyber deterrence. It’s time for a new Geneva Convention on the use of AI-enabled weapons consistent with our values because, if the Chinese set the rules, the robots will kill indiscriminately, and we will lose a future war.   Video Likewise, while we are wise to strengthen traditional alliances like NATO in the face of Russian aggression, NATO doesn’t do much to confront China in the Pacific or stop them from hacking our technology innovators in the private sector. New alliances should no longer be constrained by location on a map in our global, tech-enabled world. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Winning will take both the government and the private sector working together, and it ultimately comes down to a test of values. Our fundamental values are what unite us with our allies around the globe: liberty, democracy, and the rule of law. These values are truly our greatest strength because they are universally human.  But values alone can’t win this struggle. It’s time for America to lead, and it’s critical for humanity that we win.

494,Pressure builds on Biden to repay Venezuela for freeing American prisoners,Associated Press,2022-03-10 11:20:00,"  close     Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for March 10   Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

   Pressure is building on the Biden administration to begin unwinding sanctions on Venezuela after President Nicolas Maduro freed two American prisoners and promised to resume negotiations with his opponents. Maduro’s goodwill gesture came during a weekend trip to Caracas by senior White House and State Department officials that caught off guard Maduro’s friends and foes alike. While the Biden administration is saying little about what was discussed behind closed doors, a smug Maduro — who has sought face-to-face talks with the U.S. for years — bragged that careful protocol was followed, with the flags of the two nations ""beautifully united, as they should be."" VENEZUELA RELEASES 2 AMERICAN PRISONERS AFTER US VISIT For the past five years, the U.S. has, with little success, tried everything from punishing oil sanctions to criminal indictments and support for clandestine coups in its campaign to remove Maduro and restore what it sees as Venezuela’s stolen democracy. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended the world order, forcing the U.S. to rethink its national security priorities. Hostile petrostates under U.S. sanctions like Iran and Venezuela are seen as the most likely to benefit as President Joe Biden seeks to mitigate the impact from a ban on Russian oil imports that may aggravate the highest inflation in four decades. Venezuelan oil might help ease inflation pressures, at least psychologically and in the medium term, even if it would take time for significant supplies to reach the U.S. But while Venezuela is eager to win relaxation of the economically devastating sanctions, there were signs Thursday it’s not ready to immediately abandon ties to key ally Russia. WAPO EDITORIAL BOARD DEFENDS BIDEN TURNING TO VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA FOR OIL, SAYS HE 'HAS LITTLE CHOICE' Only days after the U.S. talks, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez met in Turkey with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sideline of his talks with Ukraine, according to a photo tweet from Russia’s embassy in Caracas, though no details of their discussions were released. Still, the approach has changed in Washington. ""Clearly at some level a decision was made to abandon some of the pillars of the U.S. policy toward Venezuela these past few years,"" said Brian Winter, vice president of the Council of the Americas. ""But until we know precisely what the Biden administration is trying to achieve, it’ll be difficult to evaluate how far this détente can go."" U.S. officials have not detailed any other specific outcomes of the talks, which were led by Juan González, who is responsible for Latin America on the National Security Council. It was the first Venezuela visit by a White House official since Hugo Chávez led the country in the late 1990s, and a rare opportunity to discuss policy issues with the Maduro government. BIDEN ADMIN COURTS VENEZUELA AS RUSSIAN ECONOMY TAKES HITS FROM SANCTIONS: REPORT One official described it as ""a constructive, diplomatic but very candid dialogue"" that did not entail any quid pro quo but allowed the Biden administration to share its ""view of the world"" with Maduro. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that it was an encouraging sign that Maduro decided to return to negotiations in Mexico with his opponents. But neither she nor anyone else in the administration would say how the U.S. would reciprocate, if at all. ""There are a range of issues moving forward, but right now we’re just celebrating the return of two Americans,"" Psaki said. But some American lawmakers are hopeful that direct talks with Maduro can produce meaningful changes. Rep. Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, applauded Biden’s efforts and said he should next suspend oil sanctions to provide support for negotiations without letting up pressure on human rights abusers and corrupt officials. GOP PUSH OIL BAN ON VENEZUELA AS BIDEN ADMIN LOOKS TO COUNTER SURGING GAS PRICES ""The Trump-era oil sanctions currently in place have only deepened the suffering of the Venezuelan people and failed to weaken Maduro’s control of the country,"" Meeks said in a statement Wednesday. One of the Americans released, oil executive Gustavo Cardenas, had been imprisoned in Venezuela since 2017, when he and several colleagues at Houston-based Citgo were lured to Caracas for what they thought was a meeting with their parent company, state run oil giant PDVSA. Instead, masked security officers bearing assault rifles burst into a conference room and arrested the men. Later they were sentenced on corruption charges stemming from a never-executed plan to refinance some $4 billion in Citgo bonds by offering a 50% stake in the company as collateral. Cardenas, in a statement Wednesday, said his imprisonment of more than four years ""has caused a lot of suffering and pain, much more than I can explain with my words."" The eight Americans who remain imprisoned in Venezuela, including five of Cardenas’ colleagues from Citgo, are an important obstacle to normal relations with Maduro. But even if a release of the remaining prisoners seems remote, Winter says there is a small window now to keep momentum building, as the U.S. gears up for a long geopolitical standoff with Russia. BIDEN DECISION TO BAN RUSSIAN OIL 'UNDERMINED' BY 'FLIRTING' WITH IRAN, VENEZUELA, CONGRESSMAN SAYS Among the options available to the U.S. is allowing Chevron — the last remaining American oil company in Venezuela — to boost production and possibly resume oil exports to Gulf Coast refineries tailor made to process the country’s tar-like crude, a U.S. official said prior to the weekend’s shuttle diplomacy. Under U.S. sanctions, Chevron is banned from negotiating with Maduro and doing all but basic upkeep on wells it operates in connection with PDVSA. There has also been speculation the U.S. could seek to reopen its embassy in Caracas, which has been shuttered since the Trump administration and other governments in 2019 recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Much depends on how much Maduro sets aside his authoritarian impulses. Even as he hosts top U.S. officials, Maduro has shown little sign he is willing to abandon Russian President Vladimir Putin. He spoke by phone with the Russian leader last week in a show of support and attended a rally in Caracas where Putin’s ambassador received a roaring ovation from ruling socialist party stalwarts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Winter said Maduro will also have to show a real willingness to negotiate in earnest with his opponents and not use the talks as he has in the past as a delaying tactic to ease international pressure. Opposition hardliners, as well as their allies in the U.S. Congress, have started to chastise Biden for abandoning a multilateral policy of isolating Maduro. Wherever the outreach ends up, some Venezuelan government insiders are already giddy over the prospects of a better future if not the return to the days when they could buy up real estate in the U.S. and spend weekends in Miami. ""It’s the beginning of the end of the conflict,"" quipped one wealthy Venezuelan businessman who has been a longtime target of U.S. federal investigators. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive bilateral issues. ""Now you’ll have to write about Russia and the oligarchs that the U.S. is going to pursue there.""  ",2022-03

   An Army veteran who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Iraq broke down Thursday on ""Fox & Friends"" why urban warfare will be difficult in  Russia’s   invasion  into Ukraine.

       (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) Bellavia explained further why combat in a ""house-to-house situation"" does not work on a tactical level for Russia. ""Just thinking about your own home, right? You know where everything is. You have lived there for years,"" he said, adding that type of warfare takes a psychological toll on soldiers who don't know where the opposing forces are located.

You don’t have to be skilled to shoot at someone going through a door,"" said Bellavia, who received the Medal of Honor  from President Trump  for his actions to save his fellow soldiers in Fallujah, Iraq. He said the amount of Ukrainians fighting for the love of their country should ""scare the hell out of Putin.""  Even while 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country amid the  Russian  invasion in the past two weeks, more than 100,000 Ukrainians and others  have flocked to Ukraine  in order to fight Putin's forces, according to Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov. Ukrainians on the ground tell Fox News Digital that volunteers have been turned away from the army because it lacks weapons.

   Did you ever wonder why are we imposing a maximum pressure campaign on  Russia  while negotiating to lift one off Iran? The reason for imposing one on Russia -- even if it is better late than never -- is all too obvious, but at the same time the reason for removing massive sanctions from Iran eludes me. With the invasion of Ukraine, we learned once again that autocratic leaders will tell you what they are going to do in advance and then, if given half a chance, they’ll do it. And, once again, we learned that these same autocratic leaders will then tell us bald-faced lies as they pursue their aforementioned desire. Iran’s Supreme Leader Khomeini said repeatedly that ""The Muslims must fight until the annihilation of Israel."" So, if Iran is given half a chance, what do reasonable people think they will do? And, should reasonable people now believe Iranian protestations to the contrary? GOP SENATORS SLAM BIDEN FOR WORKING WITH RUSSIA ON IRAN DEAL DURING UKRAINE INVASION: ‘INSANE’     
      Iran's President Hassan Rouhani speaks at a news conference September 22, 2016 in New York.  / AFP / DON EMMERT        (Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images)
       (Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) In 1999, NATO launched an air war to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo precipitated by then Serbian President Milosevic who’s declared intent was to invade. He told us what he was going to do, we looked at the evidence, and since NATO had the capability and the will to act, NATO’s intervention saved a lot of lives. Good for NATO! So, why doesn’t NATO apply the same rationale to Ukraine? NATO’s April 1999 ""Statement on Kosovo"" said its mission was a ""verifiable stop to all military action and the immediate ending of violence; the withdrawal of all forces; the stationing of an international military presence; the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons, and unhindered access to them by humanitarian aid organizations."" This NATO pre-war ultimatum to Milosevic was unequivocal: ""There can be no compromise on these conditions."" So, why hasn’t NATO agreed to a no-fly zone in Ukraine to prevent an even larger humanitarian disaster?   Video The answer is nuclear weapons. This week a friend posed this question: are we going to allow, for the first time, a nuclear-armed dictator to use nuclear blackmail to attack a non-nuclear state? My answer: apparently, we did, because Putin attacked Ukraine and continues to indiscriminately kill civilians while threatening nuclear retaliation should NATO intervene in any way.   We are, therefore, trying to punish Russia economically for Putin’s crimes without risking a nuclear confrontation. We are using all elements of our collective power to get Putin to stop, but it doesn’t look like Putin will anytime soon. Russia might choose to stop Putin, but it seems Putin didn’t get our memo. Clearly, he understands and practices nuclear blackmail.   Video So, why do we think less than maximum pressure on Iran will derail their ambitions to get the bomb if having the bomb gives autocrats so much power? In advance of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Biden said that the threat of massive sanctions is a deterrent, while insisting that imposing them in advance undermines their deterrent value. We threatened a nuclear power with sanctions.  It did not deter them. We imposed massive sanctions. They may change their behavior eventually -- sanctions take time to work -- but we don’t know if they will. Given this experience, we should try to change Iran’s behavior with maximum pressure now, rather than try to deter them with sanctions from using the bomb once they get it.   Video So, what could possibly explain our desire to lift sanctions thereby allowing Iran to sell oil again on the world market at the risk of the Ayatollahs going nuclear? Recalling Tip O’Neil’s adage that all politics are local, the price of gas at your local gas station may give us a clue. If Iran gets back to selling lots of oil, the price will come down. Iran selling oil would also give us more leverage to cut back on the consumption of Russian oil, while ensuring that America doesn’t have to get back into the dirty business of energy self-sufficiency. And so, it goes: another near-term decision that isn’t in our long-term interests. Events do indeed drive politics. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER   How do we get ourselves into these situations? First, we collectively fail to imagine that a world in which dictators, thugs, and tyrants do as they please is possible.  This failure of imagination is why we do not work as effectively or as collectively as necessary to stop such people in advance. Second, we don’t act resolutely enough early enough because we suspend belief that the potential consequence could ever happen.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Putin in Ukraine is all the reminder we need that in a nuclear-armed world we are all in this together, that tyrants and dictators tell you what they want and then lie continuously until they get it; and that resolute action before a tyrant acts, is our best hope to prevent a catastrophe.

   Ukrainians  are fleeing their country in droves as  Russia 's invasion continues, and the nation's  children  are at risk of bearing the brunt of the blow. Fox News medical contributor  Dr. Marc Siegel  shared with "" America’s Newsroom "" Thursday how dangerous uprooting children can be for their development if not treated properly.  According to the doctor, who spoke with Save the Children U.K. senior humanitarian health lead Ayesha Kadir, refugee children face a ""very high"" mortality rate due to high-stakes elements throughout travel.

   The world has watched in reverence as  Ukraine , despite all odds, has mounted a fierce resistance against  Russian  invaders.  Experts predicted that Ukraine would fall within days of Russian troops rolling in on  President Vladimir Putin’s  orders. But two weeks into the conflict, Russian troops have faced significant setbacks in their operation.

       (Provided) Still, thousands nationwide are thought to have been killed in fighting largely confined to the east. The U.N. estimates that more than 2 million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus since the end of  World War II .  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Euromaidan Press  editor-in-chief Alya Shandra, who is 38 weeks pregnant, is among the refugees who have been displaced. She and her husband, Tobias Weihmann, fled their home in Kyiv after Russian forces began shelling the city on day two of the invasion. They sent their two daughters, ages 2 and 13, to stay with Weihmann’s parents in  Germany  while they temporarily moved to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv with nothing but their suitcases.

Every other person speaks Russian, and every fourth car has a Kyiv license plate, Shandra said. Meanwhile, armed soldiers stand guard on street corners and a 10 o’clock curfew remains in place.  ""It’s a city that’s so far peaceful, but you still see signs that it’s preparing,"" Shandra said. ""It’s just very surreal for me to be in this peaceful city while on the other side of the country, people are being killed.""  CHINA BACKS RUSSIA CLAIMS US DOING ‘BIOLOGICAL MILITARY ACTIVITIES’ IN UKRAINE Though 38 weeks pregnant, Shandra keeps busy running Euromaidan Press, an independent English language Ukrainian news website she launched in 2014 as the Euromaidan revolution was sweeping Ukraine. The website, which has no central office, informs western readers about Ukraine and combats Russian propaganda. ""Ukrainians want to get away from the experience of the Soviet Union. They want to build a democratic country. They see that in the west, people live differently and they want to live like them,"" Shandra told Fox News. ""I think that after  Euromaidan , this became especially prominent. People understood the value of being able to just go in the street and protest against their leaders, to just go and say what they want.""

What unites them is, what Shandra described as, an ""indomitable spirit,"" that Ukraine will ultimately triumph.  WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING ‘#PUTINPRICEHIKE’ ""The volunteers in the center don’t have time to read the news,"" Shandra said. ""They don’t have this feeling of doom and gloom. Because the ones that stay home on the couch and just scroll through their feeds, they start panicking and saying, ‘oh, it’s all over. We’re doomed.’ But the ones that actually join the volunteer effort, they don’t have time to do that. They just work towards victory.""  ""Everybody thinks we will win,"" she added.  The contrast in outlooks parallels how many western nations predicted that the Ukrainians didn’t have a fighting chance against Russia’s more powerful military. Instead, Ukrainians, emboldened by their leader, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, have fought back.

Like, why are they writing us off?""  ""I think that expectations didn’t take into account something that’s immeasurable. That’s the spirit,"" she added.

I think that’s a really major misconception that people have. They think that refugees, they’d like to go somewhere,"" she said. ""No, we want to live here.

   Republican senators are blasting the Biden administration's refusal to provide combat aircraft to  Ukraine , expressing skepticism over the claim that such a move could escalate tensions between the U.S. and  Russia . Several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee called out the administration during a Thursday hearing, unsatisfied with what intelligence officials were saying. KAMALA HARRIS, POLAND PRESIDENT INSIST THEY'RE ‘UNIFIED’ AFTER PUBLIC DISAGREEMENT ON FIGHTER JETS FOR UKRAINE Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., noted that according to U.S. intelligence in January, Russia did not want ""a direct conflict with the United States."" Cotton doubted that this would have changed, considering the Russian military's struggling invasion of Ukraine. ""You think they're more likely to want a conflict now, after Vladimir Putin has seen the performance of his army?"" Cotton asked Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. ""You think they're more likely to want a piece of us now than they were two months ago?""

Cotton was not convinced, arguing that it appears that Putin ""deterred"" the Biden administration by claiming that transporting aircraft would be escalatory.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., shared Cotton's skepticism, but opted to keep his questions for a closed session where the witnesses could speak more freely. He did weigh in on the matter, however, after calling Cotton's questions the most significant part of the hearing thus far. ""Vladimir Putin will embrace the idea that we might self-deter every time he issues a press release. And lawyerly hair-splitting about providing this kind of weaponry is not escalatory but providing that kind of weaponry is escalatory – I don't think we really believe that,"" Sasse said.

       (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., also took a cue from Cotton and questioned the logic behind the administration's decision-making. Burr noted that both the U.S. and Poland are part of NATO, so it is curious that the U.S. would give Poland a ""green light"" to transfer aircraft to Ukraine, but ""changes their mind"" when the planes are to come from American geography. ""I draw this conclusion: this is a policy decision,"" Burr said, noting that intelligence and policy are typically kept separate.

   CENTENNIAL, Colo. –  With the  war in Ukraine  raging on, the country is in critical need of medical supplies. One nonprofit in the U.S. is trying to fill that void.  Project C.U.R.E. has 30,000 volunteers for its seven locations nationwide. It's been working nonstop since  Russia  invaded Ukraine. All equipment or supplies in the distribution centers are donations, but the journey to get these supplies to the war zone certainly isn’t easy.  Volunteers have been hard at work at the Project C.U.R.E. international headquarters and distribution center in Centennial,  Colorado.

   North Korea  tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile system in two launches Feb. 26 and March 4, a senior Biden administration official said Thursday, calling it a ""serious escalation."" The system was originally unveiled during the Korean Workers Party parade Oct. 10, 2020, and again in the Defense Exhibition in Chung Young in October 2021, the official said Thursday. The 2022 launches did not demonstrate ICBM range or capability but were likely aimed at testing elements of the new system, the official said The senior administration official predicted a future launch at ""full range,"" which may be disguised as a space launch. BIDEN ADMIN CONDEMNS NORTH KOREA MISSILE LAUNCH, SEEKS 'SERIOUS AND SUSTAINED DIPLOMACY' WITH DPRK ""The United States strongly condemns the DPRK for these tests,"" the official said. ""These launches are a brazen violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, aimlessly raise tensions and risk destabilizing the security situation in the region.""

North Korea’s actions in January appeared to be moves in ""laying the groundwork for an increase in tensions that could include ICBM or possibly a nuclear test this year — actions that Pyongyang has not taken since 2017,"" the intelligence community wrote.

       ""We have to be very careful about getting into direct conflict with Russia — Russia is a nuclear power, and we can’t allow this to escalate into a nuclear war,"" Barr said. ""I do think now is the time for prudence, and that we do not escalate — I know people see what’s going on, and they feel terrible about it — but that’s the nature of countries getting nuclear weapons: our options are curtailed."" NORTH KOREA TESTS NEW ICBM MISSILE SYSTEM IN 'SERIOUS ESCALATION,' US OFFICIAL SAYS ""That’s why having  North Korea  get nuclear weapons is a problem, and that’s why Biden’s efforts now in reopening these negotiations with Iran and letting Iran become a nuclear power is very sobering,"" Barr continued. ""After Ukraine, say some things like this happen in Israel — we would be dealing with a nuclear power."" Putin launched Russia’s multi-front war against Ukraine on Feb. 24. His brutal invasion of the country is continuing for a 15th day, and Barr warned that there could be a long road ahead. ""I think now that Putin has committed, there is no off-ramp for him,"" Barr said. ""It is hard to see a way he saves face without continuing to push forward.""

""Even if their military was operating well, I think they’ve diminished themselves in the eyes of the world as a military power, because their military is not functioning very well,"" Barr said. ""But even on paper, they don’t have the military power to do more than what they’re doing."" Barr added that, over time, he believes Putin’s strategy will be to ""neutralize"" and have ""a puppet regime in Ukraine like in Belarus.""

""I don’t think there is any risk in the short term of him expanding this to include invasions of other countries,"" Barr continued. ""I don’t think that there is a game plan to move beyond Ukraine at this point."" But Barr said Biden's weakness ""invited"" Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS ""A lot of our foreign adversaries think President Biden is a weak leader, and I think that’s partly what invited the aggression in Ukraine,"" Barr said.

""Putin also saw that Biden had curtailed American energy independence, thus increasing the leverage of Russia,"" Barr said. ""He didn’t do anything by moving equipment and resources into Ukraine before hostilities began, which might have deterred Russia,"" Barr said. ""If he had put planes there and built up the Javelin missiles upfront, you may have had more of an effect in deterring it.""   ",2022-03

   Matthew Parker, a  U.S. Army   veteran  of 20 years, is heading to  Ukraine  to assist the country's military in any capacity he can in its fight against  Russian  military forces. Parker, who owns a protective services training firm called Independent Security Advisors, LLC, plans to fly into Poland within the next few days and coordinate with his contacts there to help him cross the border into Ukraine.  ""I don't like what's happening on the ground over there. And I've seen what happens when civilians are caught in the middle of a war, and I found that the Russians have a tendency — when they can't win — to basically burn bridges,"" Parker told Fox News Digital.

       The 50-something father of four adult children added that he had become close to a Ukrainian soldier who served under him for about a year and a half when he was in the Army. That soldier still has family in Ukraine, including a sister with disabilities, which Parker said is part of the inspiration behind his decision to offer his assistance there.

""There are no DOD bioweapon labs in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world,"" the officials said. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the claims of a global network of U.S.-run biological weapons labs ""preposterous"" Wednesday. She also warned the claims could be an attempt to create cover for a Russian chemical or biological attack on Ukraine, noting that disinformation is part of the Kremlin’s weapons kit.

Meanwhile, the White House has no intentions to send U.S troops to Ukraine. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Former Attorney General Bill Barr said President Biden has ""weakened"" the United States and its economy by ""stopping"" U.S. energy production, adding that Biden had done so long before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Barr, in an interview with Fox News Digital Thursday about his new book, ""One Damn Thing After Another,"" reacted to Biden’s announcement this week to ban all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two-week long invasion of Ukraine. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""Biden has weakened the United States dramatically and the power of our economy by curtailing our energy independence — and that is even apart from Ukraine,"" Barr said. Barr added that Biden's ""decision to pull back on American energy was a disaster — is a disaster — for the United States.""   ""Ukraine certainly puts a greater emphasis on the need for us to stop all this nonsense about stopping our own energy production,"" Barr said. In announcing the ban on Russian oil imports, Biden warned that it would cost American families at the pump. Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national average price reaching $4 per gallon, the  highest average to date , according to AAA. Russian oil exports account for about one-third  of Europe’s oil imports , but Russian exports are just under 10% of U.S. overall imports. Amid surging gas prices, Biden has been facing criticism from Republicans, who have urged him to lift his executive orders that canceled the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and froze new oil and gas leases on federal lands.     
      Attorney General William Barr speaks during a news conference Dec. 21, 2020, at the Justice Department in Washington. 
       (Michael Reynolds/Pool via AP) ""It was American production that kept prices low in the United States,"" Barr said. ""And whether it is stopping the flow of energy over the Keystone, down to the refineries in the Gulf area, or the permitting process, or even the financing of exploration and oil and gas production."" TRUMP SAYS BIDEN IS LETTING 'RADICAL CLIMATE EXTREMISTS RUN OUR COUNTRY' AS US SEES RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES Barr said U.S. energy independence ""helped fuel economic growth and the broader benefits of that under the Trump administration up until COVID."" ""The fact that we are an energy giant, potentially, and that we can have inexpensive energy here in the United States, that’s also relatively clean and natural gas, gives us so many advantages economically and promises to allow us to resume high-end manufacturing and so forth at lower cost then the rest of the world,"" Barr said. ""And as we learned from COVID, it’s very important that we have here in the United States the vital resources that we need and that we’re not dependent on other countries. ""And there is nothing more vital than energy."" On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said restarting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was not one of the options on the table to alleviate rising costs of gas for Americans. ""If we’re trying to bring about more supply, that does not address any problem,"" Psaki said. ""The pipeline is just a delivery mechanism – it’s not an oil field, so it does not provide more supply into the system.""

       (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) When pressed further on whether restarting the pipeline is something the White House is considering, Psaki replied, ""There’s no plans for that, and it would not address any of the problems we’re having currently."" WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING '#PUTINPRICEHIKE' Biden this week said it is ""not true"" that his administration is holding back domestic energy production, warning that gas prices will ""go up further"" from their current record levels. And he reiterated his support for government spending on renewable energy sources and criticized the oil and gas industry for not taking full advantage of drilling opportunities in the U.S. But Barr disagreed and said limiting U.S. energy production ""increased Russia’s leverage."" ""It helped open the window for Putin to do what he is doing with the idea that he could get away with it because the Europeans would be too dependent on them,"" Barr said. ""And the prices that were being paid to him were helping to fuel his war machine."" Barr was asked about the Biden administration weighing the purchase of petroleum from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. ""It seems there is no end to the price that they are willing to pay to avoid having the United States produce its own energy,"" Barr said.  ""The idea that we're reopening relationships with Maduro, who has put the Venezuelan people through unbelievable suffering, where a high percentage have fled the country and are living in refugee camps — that we would have turned to get oil from him — just shows you the extreme degree to which they’re willing to go to do anything but have the United States produce its own energy.""    ",2022-03

   As Russia continues its assault on  Ukraine  and its major cities amid its chaotic military campaign, the struggles Moscow has faced in attempting to make progress have surprised some experts who predicted Kyiv would fall within a matter of days.  Two weeks into Russian  President Vladimir Putin 's invasion,  his forces  have been met with a determined and unexpected Ukrainian resistance that has refused to roll over, evident of the Kremlin's inability to establish air supremacy, despite a constant barrage of airstrikes. Its ability to over-perform against a larger and better equipped Russian military is in contrast to what many predicted.  Russia outnumbers Ukraine in weapons, troops and has a history of deploying its military to fight in a number of conflicts. Despite this, Ukrainian fighters have been able to launch counterattacks with regularity.  UKRAINE INVASION: RUSSIA ASK UN SECURITY COUNCIL FOR SPECIAL MEETING ON ‘BIOLABS’

       (AP Photo/Felipe Dana) Partly to blame is Russia's ineffective planning to coordinate logistics and sustainment efforts and poor leadership, experts said. ""A lot of their problems are logistical and tactical in nature,"" retired Green Beret, George Fraser, told Fox News. ""It’s not that they have bad tanks or faulty bullets as much as a terrible logistics training and lack training or experience in executing battle tactics."" Unlike the Ukrainians, who are fighting for their nation's survival, Russian troops are risking their lives while the world continues to condemn their presence in a neighboring country without provocation.  Experts initially believed Russia's ground combat forces would overwhelm Ukrainian fighters. However, its combined arms tactics – the integration of combat arms, infantry, armor and aircraft, working together – has left much to be desired, Fraser said.  As the conflict continues to escalate, images and videos posted to social media have given the world a glimpse into what's happening. Many show successful attacks on the ground and air against Russian troops while others have captured abandoned enemy vehicles with depleted tires and equipment.  Armored vehicles have so far failed to march into Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which sits a few miles from the border with Russia. A stalled military column of tanks and heavy weaponry spanning 40 miles long that was already moving at a snail's pace has halted its advance just a few miles from the capital.  The stoppage has baffled military analysts.

""In 2014, they seemed to have a war plan for Crimea that they dusted off the shelf and executed to perfection and this time they had months buildup and appeared to have no war plan at all."" Ukraine's stiff resistance is the result of a number of factors, he said, including its 2016 effort to reform its military and millions of dollars in aid and military equipment. Another is the culture of military volunteerism among Ukrainians, as many have decided against fleeing to fight, be it with firearms or  Molotov cocktails .  Amid its military struggles, Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets, and in the process upending evacuation efforts.  ""The Kremlin is bombing schools and hospitals, including maternity hospitals.

   Reports have recently emerged that a new nuclear deal with Iran, the world’s largest sponsor of terror will be concluded within days. As the  U.S. condemns Russia  for putting its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, and states they are concerned about Russia’s ""aggression"" in doing so, it seems they are simultaneously working to make possible another nuclear state.   Tellingly, since the return to the negotiating table in Vienna, three of the U.S.’ top negotiators have resigned, stating that there is no future to the agreement and that the Biden administration is being too lenient with Iran. The U.S. has not paused to question these notable resignations and has plowed ahead regardless, notwithstanding the fact that  the Iranian regime  will not negotiate directly with them, nor that they are negotiating with a country that burns their flags and has publicly labeled them ""the enemy.""   Video With less than three years until the  original JCPOA deal  reaches its conclusion in 2025, the P5+1, namely, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States, are not only stampeding toward a bad agreement, they are doing so with minimal modifications and have committed to plying the fanatic Iranian regime with billions of dollars that will undoubtedly be used to fund more terror and sow more havoc. This time the deal is not just bad, it is much, much worse.   IN UKRAINIAN CRISIS, CHINA IS PART OF PROBLEM. DOES EUROPE GET IT? This revised 2022 deal does nothing to factor in the progress that Iran has made in recent years nor does it address the clauses that have already expired, or those that will expire in the short term. Moreover, since the original deal was signed in 2015, Iran has knowingly been in breach many times, and has broken the agreement to enrich uranium to 60%, which is exceptionally close to weapon-grade nuclear capabilities.  In recent years the IAEA discovered many undeclared nuclear sites in Iran. These will not be investigated under the new agreement. Like the original JCPOA, this deal entirely ignores Iran’s research and development into long-range ballistic missiles and its sponsoring of terror throughout the region.  It is unquestionable that this renewed deal will not serve anyone’s interests other than those of Iran.    In exchange for signing the deal, and the billions of dollars the regime will reap, Iran has been promised that sanctions will be lifted on scores of terror organizations and individuals that have committed some of the worst possible atrocities. These include the lifting of sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which have conducted dozens of terror attacks globally.  It also includes the lifting of sanctions on individuals such as Ebrahim Raisi, also known as the Butcher of Tehran for his sham trials and mass execution of over 5,000 innocent Iranians in 1988, as well as for the murderous Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who personally ordered the murder of thousands of innocent Iranian dissidents who dared to protest against the corrupt and oppressive regime.     Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In return, the P5+1 will receive absolutely nothing. Iran will not be expected to destroy any of its advanced centrifuges. There will be a few added clauses, such as to reduce enrichment, but as Iran has already acquired capabilities to enrich at much higher levels this is arguably expendable. There have been no compromises from Iran on ballistic missiles or terrorist activities.  Most worryingly, we recently saw the Russian negotiator, Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, bragging in a recent interview that Russia was able to team up with China and Iran to get Iran a much better deal and that ""Iran got much more than it could expect.""    Video It is unquestionable that this renewed deal will not serve anyone’s interests other than those of Iran. While doing so it will leave Iran on the brink of nuclear capabilities. Instead of negotiating an end to terror or destruction of weaponry, the P5+1 has simply removed terror designations and appeased Iran throughout the process.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The deal being concluded in Vienna is not only a danger to the oppressed people of Iran and to Israel, whom the Iranian regime has threatened to destroy. It is also a danger to the Middle East region, to U.S. forces in the region, and to the world. This bad deal unshackles Iran to not only continue its current export of terror but enables the regime to step up its atrocities, both toward its own people and throughout the region.   This deal is a farce and must be stopped.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DANNY DANON  ",2022-03
533,Tucker Carlson: The questions about the biolabs in Ukraine that everyone should be asking,Tucker Carlson,2022-03-10 23:37:00,"  close     Video   Tucker: The Pentagon's Ukraine biolab talking points are an utter lie   Fox News host reacts to claims the U.S. has been funding biolabs in Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Wednesday, we told you that the Biden administration is funding a number of secretive biolabs in Ukraine, labs that are conducting experiments on highly dangerous pathogens. Now, that's not a story as we told you, that we wanted to do. In fact, we didn't think it could be true. It's so over-the-top and bizarre and in any case, the administration had repeatedly and very aggressively denied that they were doing anything like this and then they attacked anyone who has questions about it as a tool of Russia.  We foolishly assumed that in this one instance, they might be telling the truth and then out of nowhere, the Biden official in charge of  Ukraine  confirmed the story. Toria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State, casually mentioned in a Senate hearing on Tuesday that actually, yes, the Biden administration does fund a series of biolabs in Ukraine and whatever is in these labs is so dangerous that she is deeply concerned these materials will fall into the hands of the Russian military.   Now, that struck us as a shocking development. Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true. Toria Nuland's testimony raised at least two immediate questions. What exactly are these labs doing with our money and in our name? And why didn't the Biden administration secure the contents of these labs before the Russians invaded?   WHO DOCUMENTS RUSSIAN ATTACKS AGAINST 21 UKRAINE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES; WEST CONDEMNS       
      Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testifies before a Senate Foreign Relation Committee hearing on Ukraine on March 08, 2022 in Washington, DC. 
       (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) So far, we haven't received any answer at all to the second question. We think we're the only ones who have even asked it. Whoever decided to leave deadly biological materials sitting in Ukraine as Russian troops massed on the border has not yet been identified. We hope that person will be identified. We'll keep asking.  As for the first question, what exactly is going on in these labs? We've gotten several answers, all of them insulting. Initially, the administration claimed the labs were designed to help the Ukrainians fight tuberculosis, as well as various livestock diseases. That's what officials told members of Congress. It didn't seem plausible and, in fact, it's not plausible. And then after our show last night, the  Pentagon  released what it non-ironically called a fact sheet designed to make the biolab story seem small and ridiculous. Virtually every news organization in America, with almost no exceptions, repeated the administration's claim verbatim with no verification of any kind.   Foreign Policy Magazine ran this version of it, which was identical to many other versions you saw if you follow the news today. ""FACT CHECK: DoD has worked with Ukraine to ELIMATE (in all caps) bioweapons left behind by the Soviet Union since 2005,"" said a senior U.S. defense intelligence official, ""but these are NOT (again, in all caps) weapons labs as Russians falsely claim,"" the official said.   The Washington Post assured us of the same thing, so did countless other so-called news organizations. OK, so no big deal. This is not actually a story. The Pentagon's been doing it since 2005, working with Ukrainians to ""eliminate biological weapons left behind by the Soviets."" That makes sense, but wait. 2005 was 17 years ago. How long does it take to eliminate Soviet bioweapons? Seventeen years seems like a long time. If you had 17 years and ample funding from Congress, you could probably remove and catalog every grain of sand on Waikiki Beach and yet somehow, over that same period 17 years, the Pentagon has not finished removing test tubes from Soviet-era freezers.   How does that work exactly? How heavy are these bioweapons? Do we lack the  transportation  capacity to get them out of Ukraine and bury them in the desert in Nevada? When was the Pentagon planning to finish this important job? In 20 years? In 50 years? Those all seem like very obvious questions, but not a single reporter asked any of those questions.   RUSSIA-UKRAINE: FORMER AG BARR SAYS US ‘CAN’T ALLOW THIS TO ESCALATE INTO A NUCLEAR WAR’     Video Meanwhile, over at CNN, perhaps where the first explanation didn't make sense once you thought about it, offered a new alibi. According to CNN's site, the labs in Ukraine exist to ""secure old Soviet weapons."" Ok, secure, not eliminate, which raises the question: what does it mean to secure a bioweapon? And again, why has it taken 17 years to do it? And by the way, if these are really just old Soviet weapons, why is Toria Nuland so worried they will wind up in the hands of old Soviets who presumably already have these very same weapons—probably don't need more. It's absurd when you think about it. So, don't think about it and that was the point of today's coverage of the Biden administration's secret Ukrainian biolabs. Stop thinking about it. Start accepting what they tell you at face value. Otherwise, you are an agent of Russia. Here's CNN: KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCHER:  The foreboding music, biohazard warnings. This Russian state media footage from 2015 claims to show America running facilities in Ukraine and Georgia that caused deadly outbreaks of disease and killed local livestock. This story is false, but that has not stopped it continuing to circulate, evolving from biological hazards to biological weapons and becoming a key part of Russia's disinformation campaign justifying the invasion of Ukraine. The claims were debunked several years ago, when in 2020, the United States issued a statement to ""set the record straight,"" explaining the facilities are in fact for vaccine development and to report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats.   ""These claims were debunked several years ago."" These facilities work on vaccines and reporting outbreak, and then they play Russian propaganda. The point is anyone who asks questions about this is repeating Russian propaganda. Got it? And the truth is, we're not interested in what Russian propagandists say about these Ukrainian biolabs. We're not interested in what the propagandists at CNN say about these biolabs. We're Americans, so we would like, in fact, we think we have a right to demand the Biden administration to answer simple questions, straightforward questions. These are obviously questions important enough to make Toria Nuland very nervous. But why? We don't know. They won't answer.   So, instead, we did some digging of ourselves to see what we could find and here's we came up with. The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Robert Pope, the man who heads the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DOD, sat for an interview with the website Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Pope was the man in charge of securing or eliminating Soviet-era bioweapons, so he knows a lot about the subject, maybe more than anyone else, but it turns out that not all of these Soviet weapons are being destroyed or even secured, and Pope acknowledged that in the interview, which apparently CNN didn't see.   According to his interview, Pope said the labs ""may hold pathogen strains left over from the Soviet bioweapons program preserved in freezers for research purposes."" Pope said that ""scientists, being scientists, it wouldn't surprise me if some of these strange collections and some of these laboratories still have pathogen strains that go all the way back to the origins of that program.""     US VOWS TO HALT GASLIGHTING AFTER RUSSIA ASKS UN SECURITY COUNCIL FOR SPECIAL MEETING ON ‘BIOLABS’ IN UKRAINE   In other words, because as Pope put it, ""scientists are scientists,"" they don't want to destroy all the bioweapons. Instead, they're using them to conduct new bioweapons research. That's what he said and not just on strains left over from the Soviet Union. The second lie. In fact, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has acknowledged joint American and Ukrainian research on other pathogens such as hemorrhagic fever virus. Apparently, there's a lot of this going on in Ukraine funded by the United States. Did you know that? Why Ukraine? We don't know. We can only guess.  We do know that in 2010, the U.S. government helped fund construction of a brand-new level-3 biolab in Odessa, Ukraine. The purpose of that lab was not to eliminate or secure aging Soviet weapons. No. That lab was designed for research a new and ""especially dangerous pathogens"" in Ukraine, the poorest country in Europe. Again, not a hotbed of biomedical research. Why Ukraine? We don't know. Someone should find out.   We do know that the Pentagon talking points you saw reported as fact on television today and last night were an utter lie. Did the reporters, who repeated those talking points verbatim, know they were a lie? Maybe they did. On the other hand, how would they know? They didn't bother to do any reporting whatsoever. They got a text from some Biden administration flack and they just read it on the air like it was true. You shouldn't be surprised because that's what they do and it's possible they're afraid not to do that. They know if they stray from the script the White House has written for them, they'll be denounced from the briefing room as tools of Putin. Here's Biden's publicist doing the very same thing today:   PRESS SECRETARY JEN PSAKI:  The main issue that prompted my Twitter thread yesterday was that Russia has a history also of inventing outright lies like this, which is the suggestion that the United States has a chemical and biological weapons program, or Ukraine does, that they're operating. Russia is the one, is the country, that has a chemical and biological weapons program. So, the objective was to make clear the inaccuracy of the information, the misinformation they're trying to put out, and make clear to the world that they not only have the capacity, they have a history of using chemical and biological weapons, and that, in this moment, we should have our eyes open.

That's all true.   The question is: Why is the United States funding these biolabs that are not doing anything close to what the Pentagon claims they are doing? Why is the White House press secretary from the podium contradicting what the director of the Pentagon's bioweapons control program has already admitted is true? Why is she doing that and how should we feel about all of this? Insulted, but also very concerned. There is absolutely a story here, a story that matters, clearly.

   As Russia massed a large military presence on its border with Ukraine weeks before launching its invasion,  Western intelligence officials were concerned  the capital city of Kyiv could fall in a matter of days amid a Russian assault. Now two weeks into the conflict, the capital remained in Ukrainian hands and Russian troops have failed to make substantial progress as opposition forces continue to put up fierce resistance.  Russian forces were reportedly  trying to encircle the city, but the loss of equipment and personnel has taken its toll and significantly slowed their advance.  Meanwhile, Moscow has targeted  several Ukrainian cities  with devastating airstrikes that have left civilians dead and forced many to flee to neighboring countries.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   Video The predictions that Kyiv would fall, a major Russian objective, represented an intelligence failure, though not a major one, said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America."" Part of the misstep by intelligence officials was the influence of previous events, she said, citing the disastrous  withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan , the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq War.  ""They're a little bit influenced by that and they wanted to telegraph to the policymakers the urgency,"" Koffler told Fox News.  Milley's prediction In early February, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told lawmakers during a closed-door briefing that  Kyiv could fall within 72 hours  after a full-scale Russian invasion. He said the operation could result in 15,000 Ukrainian military deaths and 4,000 Russian troop deaths. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTEL OFFICIALS PREDICT ‘UGLY’ WEEKS AHEAD AS PUTIN DOUBLES DOWN That prediction, like predictions regarding how long Afghanistan's army could last without U.S. support, has already been disproved. Kyiv has held out long past the dire prognostication. The war grinds on. Last week, Russia claimed it had lost 498 military personnel, a figure widely disputed by the Pentagon, which put the death toll somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000. Ukraine has claimed nearly 11,000 Russian military deaths and the Kremlin is believed to be actively concealing the true number.

       The fact remains that Kyiv did not fall, and Afghanistan did not stand, despite  Milley's speculations in May 2021  that the U.S.-backed government there could. ""It's not a foregone conclusion, in my professional military estimate, that the Taliban automatically win and Kabul falls, or any of those kind of dire predictions,"" Milley said during a news briefing at the time. ""There's a significant military capability in the Afghan government, and we have to see how this plays out.""    Video Afghanistan fell swiftly to the Taliban after the U.S. military  shuttered Bagram Air Base . Milley, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was among the Biden administration leaders who green-lit that plan. They are now helping direct the U.S. response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Closer to Kyiv The fighting between both sides has moved closer to Kyiv as civilians continue to be targeted by Russian shelling. On Monday, Ukrainian officials claimed to have downed two Russian aircraft over the area and Russian artillery units have shelled the outer portions of the city. From a manpower standpoint, Russia has sent nearly 100% of its combat forces into Ukraine, Defense Department officials said Monday. This is an unusual move: Armed forces tend to keep numbers in reserve outside the theater of combat. In addition, Moscow was  recruiting Syrian fighters  to back up the Russian army as the Kremlin struggled to contain its losses, along with global condemnation over the invasion and political and economic isolation. Moscow has already reportedly sent Chechen forces to hunt down  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , and those forces have reportedly been eliminated by the Ukrainians. Pete Marocco, former deputy assistant Secretary of State for conflict and stabilization operations, told Fox News that predictions about whether Kyiv would fall to Russian troops came before the  Beijing   Winter Olympics  in February.

       ""I’m not sure it was an intelligence failure. I don’t know that it was an inaccurate statement to say that it could have fallen within 72 hours,"" he said. ""As time languished on, Ukraine became prepared."" He noted that such dire warnings could possibly be messaged with the intent of spurring one’s allies to make necessary preparations or possibly overcompensating for the miscalculations in  Afghanistan . ‘Lull before the start’ Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came days after the end of the Winter Games, a misstep on Putin’s part, said Marocco. The reason why he waited to begin military operations is left to speculation, he said.

       ""I don’t see him as having that sort of sensitivity or caring unless there might have been some sort of tactic or mutual agreement with China,"" Marocco said. ""If he did that, that would be a surprising strategic blunder on his part. I tend to think that there’s another explanation behind the scenes as to why there was this lull before the start. Perhaps to allow predictable sanctions targets enough time to move assets before U.S. sanctions would be put in place."" As the war rages, intelligence warnings of the downfall of Kyiv are irrelevant, said Daniel Hoffman, a retired CIA Senior Clandestine Services Officer. He added that intelligence doesn't make predictions.    Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Russian logistics suck. The supply chain sucks. Zelenskyy has been a hero.

       ((Photo by Sergei GUNEYEV / SPUTNIK / AFP) (Photo by SERGEI GUNEYEV/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)) A  native  of Aleppo, who viewed Putin’s missile attacks on Ukrainian cities to Al Jazeera, said, ""He [Putin] is going to go full Aleppo on Ukraine. … It’s crazy that what we experienced a few years ago is being replayed almost frame by frame in Ukraine."" Similar brutality was evidenced against the Chechens. In 1999, Russia’s air force bombed the Chechen capital of Grozny in response to Putin’s order to destroy the city. Soon, Grozny laid in waste, tens-of-thousands dead and in  Putin’s words , his troops ""fulfilled their task to the end.""  Juxtapose the scenes in Aleppo and Grozny with what happened in the Balkans. In 1999, the western allies, led by the US, responded to the mass atrocities committed in Kosovo by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic and did so under the doctrine of the ""right to humanitarian intervention."" At the time, the US and its allies provided a no-fly zone over Kosovo until the killing stopped and then put troops on the ground to ensure civilian safety.  Most informed observers of that war confirm that the west’s intervention saved Kosovo and many thousands of lives. CHIEF INTERNATIONAL PROSECUTOR WARNS 'TYRANTS' LIKE CHINA WILL ACT IF PUTIN NOT PUNISHED The international community has long wrestled with what to do with the issue of humanitarian crises like Kosovo, whether they are the result of internal conflict or created by outside forces like the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

(Francesco Malavolta) In fact, those efforts gave rise to the doctrine of ""Responsibility to Protect"" (R2P), a norm under international law that guides the world community to protect populations against atrocities.  When such issues are turned over to the United Nations, however, they fail, and often get worse.  The typical U.N. failure is not an excuse for moral societies to refuse to create safety nets when governments don’t protect their own people (like the 1994 Rwanda genocide which claimed 800,000 lives) or when outside tyrants like Milosevic savage sovereign states.   Video The latter is the situation with Ukraine today. Brave Ukrainians are likely to continue to resist Putin’s assaults and therefore, because of Russia’s significant military power and past experience, we should expect the Kremlin’s tyrant to go ""full Aleppo"" on them, no holds barred, no mercy even for the innocent women and children.  Meanwhile, more millions of Ukrainians will flood out of that country seeking refuge. CHINA ACCUSES US OF ‘BIOLOGICAL MILITARY ACTIVITIES’ IN UKRAINE History is clear that thugs such as Putin won’t stop with Ukraine, which reminds us that the rest of us are vulnerable as well.  We know from the mouth of the tyrant himself that more countries must fall in order to resurrect his vision of a renewed Russian empire. After all, he sees his role not just reversing the end of the Soviet Union (1991) but undoing the  Bolshevik policies  that formed the contemporary state system across Eurasia.   Video No wonder armed humanitarian intervention is a topic much discussed among Europeans and Americans today.  After all, many of us want to do more more action than just promises to stop buying Russian energy, flowing weapons to Ukrainian fighters and aiding the flood of frightened refugees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER We believe that much more ought to be done, perhaps like what we mounted against the Serbian dictator to save the Kosovars.  However, as many of our leaders say under their breath, Putin’s threat of nuclear war makes humanitarian intervention impossible. That’s a poor excuse. President Biden and our nuclear-armed allies in London and Paris must remind the butcher in Moscow that we too have a nuclear arsenal and we’re ready to use it. Better we talk commonsense now and stop threatening each other with nuclear assured annihilation. That public reminder of a nuclear stand-off should take the issue off the table.

Of course, we will coordinate with Russian authorities announcing our intent to set up safe zones across Ukraine to help the civilian population.

       (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) More than one million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since the start of the Russian invasion last month, according to Catherine Russell, the executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). At least 37 children have been killed and 50 were injured since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on Feb. 24, Russell said. According to the UN, the lives of at least 549 civilians have been snuffed out during Russia's invasion.

While still there, Skuibida described to Fox News Digital the scene at the border. ""I wanted to go there to try and meet them and greet them … and to help them because I speak Ukrainian.""   In Poland, Skuibida said her immediate focus was comforting as many people who fled Ukraine as she could.

NATO countries are afraid to irritate Putin. ""He is the monkey with the grenade. Do you think you can control him throwing or dropping the grenade?"" she asked. ""Moldova, Poland, the Baltic States understand that Putin’s disrespect for the Western world order is so deep that he will not be stopped by the EU or NATO membership when, or if, he gets Ukraine.""

Spartz warns Ukraine refugee crisis cannot be Poland's 'problem alone'   Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind, joined 'Fox & Friends' urging the U.S. and other nations to step up with concrete 'action' to help Ukrainian refugees amid the war with Russia. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The government plane was already full for the bipartisan congressional delegation trip to the  Ukraine  border, but Rep.  Victoria Spartz , R-Ind., was determined to see the crisis herself, so she booked a commercial flight to meet up with her colleagues in Poland last weekend.  Spartz, a Ukraine native, had been hearing first-hand accounts of Russia's brutal assault on the Ukrainian people from her family and friends in Ukraine. And when she arrived at the border she firsthand witnessed the ""heartbreaking"" scenes of women and children fleeing Ukraine and the tragedy that is unfolding.     
      Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., traveled to the Ukraine-Poland border the weekend of March 4, 2022, to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Photo courtesy of Rep. Victoria Spartz's office) 
       ""It's heartbreaking to watch. … When you see in person the human suffering, and you see these little kids and moms leaving their houses with nothing [in] cold weather, it really has an effect on you,"" Spartz told Fox News Digital. ""It's a tragedy what's happened there."" VICTORIA SPARTZ, UKRAINE NATIVE, DELIVERS TEARFUL PLEA TO BIDEN: DON'T 'EMBARRASS' US As the fighting continues into a third week, Spartz warned that more suffering is coming.   ""It's going to get worse before it gets better because a lot of people that will start coming from the more eastern, northern territories have been bombed for a few weeks and under siege and will have a lot of health issues, will have no friends or families,"" Spartz said. ""They have no means. So this really needs to be addressed.""

       Spartz praised the way Poland's people have welcomed war refugees into their homes but urged the international community to do more to help support Poland and the families escaping war, as well as ensuring safe humanitarian corridors for more women and children to flee. Russia has violated safe passages and shelled civilians as they are trying to escape to the point where Spartz said Ukrainians are stuck – thinking it's too dangerous to attempt to leave. ""I am very upset that there is not more pressure from international organizations to force humanitarian corridors and monitor them,"" Spartz said. ""It has to happen because I think … hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people will start dying in some of these cities. The scale … will be a catastrophe.""

       Spartz was a late addition to the bipartisan delegation trip organized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in connection with Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to the region. Other members on the trip included Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory W. Meeks, D-N.Y., Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Reps. Ann Wagner, R-Mo.; David Cicilline, D-R.I.; Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; Raul Ruiz, D-Calif.; Susan Wild, D-Pa.; and Gerry Connolly, D-Va. REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK HEADS TO UKRAINE BORDER: 'I WILL GO AS FAR AS ... THEY WILL ALLOW ME TO GO' The delegation wanted to send a strong message of bipartisan unity that the United States stands with Ukraine and that help is on the way. The House already approved a $13.6 billion aid package for Ukraine and passed a resolution condemning Russia for the brutal invasion. Spartz, who left Ukraine at the age of 21, has become a powerful advocate for Ukraine with her emotional speeches from the Capitol on the horrors of the war and the need for the United States, European Union and others to do more to help.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES The fight for Ukraine is personal. Spartz said her grandma has not been able to get out of Ukraine because her hometown has been too heavily bombed as Russian forces are targeting civilians. ""The saddest thing for me to see is how ruthless these people are to kill kids,"" Spartz said, noting the recent bombing of a maternity hospital.""They're killing people and people are afraid to leave.""

   As the Russia-Ukraine war drags on past the two-week mark — and as some 2.5 million people have now left Ukraine in search of safety — prominent faith leaders from all across America continue to share their  views, wisdom and prayers for the Ukrainian people  during this horror. T.D. Jakes, who runs The Potter's House in Dallas, Texas, told Fox News Digital this week, ""The images of brutality from the last two weeks have been hard to watch. But it’s important that we do, as there are many hard lessons the American people can take away from this tragic situation."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES He said, ""What we have seen so far has been horrific — but triumph and tragedy often cohabitate in the same space. Triumph in this case is not simply the restoration of democracy, although that's the ultimate goal. Ukrainians are currently triumphant in their spirit of patriotism, which they're displaying through their relentless fight for what is right.""     
      T.D. Jakes is shown speaking to radio listeners in the Inspiration 1390AM ""Sprite Lounge"" on May 13, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois. Jakes shared his views of the war in Ukraine — and what he believes all Americans must know — with Fox News Digital this week.
       (Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) Jakes, who is also a best-selling author, filmmaker, global entrepreneur and philanthropist, said there are lessons here to be learned by Americans. Chief among them is this: ""Freedom is expensive. In the days ahead, we'll all pay some price to support the Ukrainian people. It will be difficult for  many of us as gas prices rise . Yet when we compare the price of gas against the price of blood, against the death of children, the price of gas seems bearable.""

FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT: REFLECT, REPENT Jakes said, ""As we forge ahead into Holy Week, we must recognize how fragile democracy is and understand the necessity of unity in a functioning political system. If Ukraine had been as divided as the U.S. is today, they would have already been defeated. Their unity, patriotism and tenacity are the only reasons they are doing as well as they are.""

       Further, Jakes said that ""the American people must take this as an opportunity to be less divisive. Remember we are not red states and blue states. We are together the red, white and blue.""   ""We must do unto others as we would have them do unto us."" — T.D.

   Warsaw’s mayor is appealing for international help as the city becomes overwhelmed by refugees, with more than a tenth of all those fleeing the war in  Ukraine  arriving in the  Polish  capital. Some seek to wait out the war or settle in the city, while others merely use Warsaw as a transit point to head further west, turning the city’s train stations into crowded hubs where people are camping out on floors. ""We are dealing with the greatest migration crisis in the history of Europe since World War II. ... The situation is getting more and more difficult every day,"" Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said, adding that ""the greatest challenge is still ahead of us."" The welcome Warsaw has given Ukrainians as the neighboring nation struggles to resist Russia’s invasion is wholehearted. Across the city, people have mobilized to help. They are taking Ukrainians into their homes, gathering donations and volunteering at reception centers. City monuments and buses fly Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag in solidarity. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  But the challenge is enormous. Much of the burden so far is being carried by volunteers taking time off work, a situation not sustainable in the long run. Trzaskowski noted on Friday that child psychologists, in one example, had been volunteering to help refugees but soon will need to return to their jobs.   Video Housing is also a growing problem. When the war began, 95% of Ukrainians arriving in Warsaw were people who already had friends or family here and were taken in by them. Today that group is 70% of the new arrivals meaning that 30% of them ""need a roof over their heads"" and other support, the mayor said Friday. The decline in the city’s ability to absorb a massive number of new arrivals comes as the people fleeing war are those who have witnessed greater trauma than those who arrived earlier, or who are more vulnerable. US DOCTORS PROVIDE FREE TELEHEALTH FOR UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS, CIVILIANS, REFUGEES Late Thursday 15 disabled Ukrainian children arrived at the Medyka border crossing in Poland, and were put on a special makeshift medical train taking them to various hospitals in the country. Dr. Dominik Daszuta, an anesthesiologist at Central Medical  hospital  MSWIA in Warsaw, described how the medical train was outfitted with intensive care capabilities. He spoke as medical staff lifted children in their strollers onto the train bound for Gdynia. ""At the beginning the people who came here were running away in panic from the war they saw in the media and that they heard about. Now we find there are people escaping from bombs,"" said Dorota Zawadzka, a child psychologist volunteering at a center for refugees set up in the Torwar sports center. ""This is a completely different kind of refugee. They are afraid of everything. They sit in their jackets. Children are scared, they don’t want to play, their mothers have such empty eyes."" US LEADERS PREDICTED KYIV'S SWIFT FALL AFTER RUSSIAN INVASION. WHY WERE THEY SO WRONG? Lena Nagirnyak, a 35-year-old from Kyiv, found shelter at Torwar with her children after initially hoping to stay in Ukraine. They finally fled on foot from Bucha to Irpin after hearing a bomber flying low overhead. ""The next day, the street we were walking on was bombed. If we had left a day later, we might have died,"" she said.

       (AP Photo/Daniel Cole) The war has already forced 2.5 million people to flee, according to the International Organization for Migration on Friday, and more than half of those go to Poland. As of Friday more than 1.5 million refugees had entered Poland, according to Poland’s Border Guard agency. Trzaskowski said that over 320,000 people have traveled through Warsaw since the start of the war and that 230,000 people were staying in the city of more than 1.7 million people. CONGRESS GETS UP CLOSE VIEW OF 'HORRIFIC' RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: MAKES YOU WANT 'TO BREAK DOWN IN TEARS' Other parts of the region are also under strain. Even the Czech Republic, which does not border Ukraine directly, has an estimated 200,000 refugees, many of whom are in Prague. As the city runs out of housing options, city hall has begun preparing temporary accommodation. ""The demand for accommodation in Prague is enormous and by far surpasses what we can offer,"" Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib said. Meanwhile, the national government appealed to Czech citizens to house refugees in their own homes, promising that it would find a way to compensate them. Poland has already taken a similar step, with the parliament approving a law offering people 40 zlotys ($9.20) per day for each refugee they give shelter to. It’s part of a new legislative package that also offers some financial help and health insurance to the Ukrainians.

He's certainly aware that the convoy outside of Kyiv was vulnerable, and so, the -- some of those vehicles, some of the tanks have dispersed and they're maneuvering in place, reportedly as close as, you know, nine – a few miles away from the city center to launch a strike. If past is prologue, they're looking at scorched earth along the lines we saw in Grozny and Aleppo. And I think the question for the Biden administration: Is there more we can do? Have we done enough? That's certainly a question our elected leaders are asking this administration, and rightly so.  WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:   Video  ",2022-03

   The co-hosts of ABC's liberal daytime talk show "" The View "" complained Friday the criticism leveled against Vice President Kamala Harris over her performance while in Europe has been rated in racism and misogyny.  During the opening segment of their Friday show, co-hosts  Joy Behar , Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro specifically pointed to the criticism Harris received following an awkward moment at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. After a reporter asked a question about Ukrainian refugees, Harris and Duda appeared confused about who would answer the question, leading to  Harris laughing  while saying, ""A friend in need is a friend indeed."" Duda then offered to respond first and began speaking.  Harris  was ripped by critics  following the exchange, accusing her of looking to Duda for help answering the question and slamming her for laughing amid the suffering of Ukrainians at the hands of the Russian military.

""I don’t see them making fun of Pence’s laugh or any of the guys."" Hostin turned the criticism to race, arguing that critics were claiming Harris was unprepared during the press conference because she was a Black woman.  ""What it is is that they constantly question the qualifications of Black women, and that’s why people are saying that she’s unprepared,"" she said.  Guest co-host and former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham jumped in, saying she disagreed and thought Harris was ""a very accomplished woman."" ""You can disagree, but that's the truth of it,"" Hostin snapped back, appearing frustrated. ""This is based in racism. This is based in misogyny. And we’re talking about a woman that has extensive experience abroad, extensive experience as an attorney, extensive experience as the chief legal officer of one of our largest states in the country and I think this is just much ado about nothing.""

   Months-long talks with  Iran  to revive the 2015 nuclear deal hit a snag Friday after  Russia  demanded sanctions imposed on Moscow for its war in Ukraine be excluded from Tehran dealings.   A source with knowledge of the discussions told Fox News that the Russian delegation upended final-hour negotiations by demanding sanction immunity for any future trade with Iran.

       (Iranian Presidency Office/AP) President Biden  made it a top priority of his administration to reinstate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) after the U.S. abandoned the plan under former  President Trump  in 2018. GOP SENATORS SLAM BIDEN FOR WORKING WITH RUSSIA ON IRAN DEAL DURING UKRAINE INVASION: 'INSANE' JCPOA member nations like the  U.K. ,  France ,  Germany  and the EU warned against the move and urged Iran to continue its existing commitments to the deal.  But by 2019 Tehran argued the deal was moot due to crippling sanctions imposed by the U.S. and began  redeveloping  its nuclear program. JCPOA member nations, including top U.S. adversaries like  China  and Russia, backed the administration’s push to re-establish the nuclear deal last year.  But nuclear talks with Tehran have proven to be slow, and White House officials have repeatedly warned Iranian counterparts that time is running out to find a solution.

BIDEN ADMIN'S IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS 'NOT GOING WELL,' NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER SAYS Talks eventually resumed, but questions over good-faith negotiations prompted several halts in the months-long discussions. The White House said this week that it was ""close"" to wrapping up a deal. ""We have been close for some time now,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The end of negotiations is always when the difficult and challenging parts of the conversation typically take place."" But deteriorating ties with Moscow over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine with the West has prompted new hurdles for Washington and its allies.  On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Fox News that Russia was continuing to participate in the negotiations and said, ""We continue to work to see if we can come back to mutual compliance with Iran on the deal.""  ""Russia continues to be engaged in those efforts, and it has its own interests in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon,"" he added. But new demands from Moscow appear to have once again stunted talks. High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell Fontelles took to Twitter to say that a final text was ""essentially ready and on the table"" and vowed to continue working to reach an agreement.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But apart from Russia’s attempts to circumvent its own crippling sanctions, sources have told Fox News that Iran is seeking additional demands of its own.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Ukrainians from all walks of life are seeking shelter from the violence, and many Jewish charities have stepped up to help. The endeavor comes amid the uproar over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s stated goal to ""de-Nazify"" the Ukraine's government — a suggestion observers have scoffed at, especially since its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish. ""We are people of faith, and it is of critical importance that we turn to God in prayer at this moment of upheaval for the world order,"" said Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union (OU), one of the largest Orthodox Jewish organizations in the United States. ""We pray for peace, and specifically that God endow the leaders of the free world the courage and wisdom to act decisively to prevent further destruction.""  The OU has raised over $1 million so far, and its affiliated synagogues have raised millions more to help Ukrainians in their hour of need. The aid, Hauer explained, is going to Jewish and non-Jewish people alike. CONGRESS GETS UP CLOSE VIEW OF 'HORRIFIC' RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: MAKES YOU WANT 'TO BREAK DOWN IN TEARS' ""We have focused our support on efforts to evacuate people from Ukraine to neighboring countries, relocation to safer zones within the country when evacuation is impractical, support for refugees, and support for communities and individuals remaining in their homes and communities,"" Hauer said. These include provision of transportation, security, shelter, food and clothing for thousands of people at costs that are extremely inflated due to wartime. Following the Holocaust and, decades later, the breakup of the former Soviet Union, where organized religious activity was all but illegal, a Jewish renaissance in Ukraine took place. Yet with estimates of between 200,000 and 350,000 Jews in Ukraine, the nation's population is dwindling quickly, as some 2.5 million Ukrainians so far have escaped to seek shelter in neighboring countries.     
      Rabbi Mendel Cohen praying in Moldova.
       (Orthodox Union) With millions of dollars so far raised by Jewish organizations, many groups in Ukraine and surrounding countries are working around the clock to systematize the help. In a call organized by the OU with journalists on Wednesday, several charities and faith leaders spoke of their work and experiences. Tzvi Sperber, the director of the charity JRoots, said his group mobilized quickly to help. ""We thought of the lessons that were learned, and that we learned most from the Shoah [Holocaust] itself: We couldn't sit and not do anything. So that's why we got on planes and we started to mobilize as quickly as we could."" His group managed to find a property in Krakov, Poland where they are housing around 100 people. In addition, he has also procured a hotel in the same city to help with the growing refugee crisis. ""We can only do our small little part here. We're helping Jews and non-Jews."" ""Unfortunately, in the last 13 days, our city is under siege,"" said Rabbi Mendel Cohen. He's the chief rabbi of Mariupol, the besieged city on the Sea of Azov. ""The Jews of our community sit in shelters with no food, no water, no medicine, no phone, no internet. They cannot go out; the shops are empty. There is robbery in the streets and unfortunately, the Russians are playing psychological warfare with the people of Mariupol because they cannot take the city."" GEN.

""I see the pictures of the members of my community or setting my table for Shabbat [Sabbath.] We celebrate together Purim and Pesach, and I'm thinking: Are they alive? The kids who came to my kindergarten, the kids that learn in my school, where are they now? Do they have food? And I see the pictures, I see bodies in the streets of Mariupol [and] I'm asking myself again and again: Did I [do] the most I can?"" In one remarkable story, Rabbi Refael Kruskal, who runs an orphanage in Odesa, said he and his team were able to get out around 700 civilians out of the country into Moldova. He said his group included orphans, students, staff and families of alumni from the center. They're now staying in hotels on the bordering country.     
      Ukrainians from all walks of life look to get shelter from the violence and many Jewish charities have stepped up to help.

As resilient as they are, they've been through a tremendous amount of trauma.""  He continued: ""The most important things for us is to try and bring some kind of semblance of normality back to their lives, by starting school [and] by starting lessons."" The rabbi said it took them some 31 hours to get to Moldova and said they are sending free buses back as he vowed to do his best to help those left behind. ""We're working on many fronts in order to save and get out as many people as possible."" Kharkiv’s Chief Rabbi Moshe Moskowitz described his first six days of the war before he and his wife were able to leave. He confirmed what millions have witnessed on their television screens. ""As every day goes, the bombing is getting stronger. Every day there was […] bombing in the center of the city, next to our house, next to the synagogue. There were tanks going,"" he recounted.

She has since joined a convoy of other vehicles and volunteers consisting of truck drivers, bus drivers, a ""colonel"" who runs a nonprofit, an EMT and a law enforcement officer. They travel together and take turns driving the bus she rented, so they do not have to stop at all. The convoy transports humanitarian supplies into Ukraine and refugees out of Ukraine.

   An optimistic  President Biden  rallied the Democratic Party ahead of November’s  midterm elections , when they hope to defend their razor-thin House and Senate majorities. ""Coming out of the State of the Union, we are in the strongest position we’ve been in months,"" the president argued as he addressed the  Democratic National Committee ’s winter meeting. On Thursday evening he emphasized that Democrats ""have a record – a record to be proud of; an agenda that addresses the biggest concerns here in America, in people’s lives; the message that resonates."" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS  But a new national survey suggests the president’s comments are wishful thinking, that talk of a Biden ""bounce"" in the polls – following his  State of the Union address  on March 1 and after most Americans appear to be supportive of his handling of America’s moves to punish Russia for its deadly assault on neighboring  Ukraine  – might be overrated. An NPR/PBS/Marist national survey released March 4 that indicated the president’s approval up to 47% and his disapproval down to 51% grabbed plenty of headlines. And it was followed earlier this week by polls from Reuters/Ipsos and Politico/Morning Score that also suggested a post-State of the Union bump for Biden. But Biden stands well underwater at 42% approval and 57% disapproval in a  Wall Street Journal survey  conducted March 2-7 and released on Friday. Those numbers were virtually unchanged for the Journal’s previous poll, which was conducted in November. Half of those questioned in the poll cited inflation and the economy as their most pressing issue, and 63% give the president a thumbs-down on how he’s handling the soaring costs of fuel and food. And by a 47%-30% margin, those surveyed said Republicans rather than Democrats were better able to handle inflation. ""The mood of the country hasn’t gotten any better since the last poll. In fact, it’s gotten a little worse,"" Democratic pollster John Anzalone told the Journal. Anzalone, who was the lead pollster on Biden’s successful 2020 presidential campaign, conducted the Journal survey along with veteran Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, who conducted surveys for former President Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. 2021: THE YEAR THAT BIDEN'S POLLS SLOWLY SANK UNDERWATER With under eight months to go until the midterms, the survey indicated the GOP with a five-point advantage over the Democrats in the generic ballot, a key barometer used to gauge support for congressional races.  And the poll’s generic ballot question pointed to a big jump in support for Republican among Hispanic voters and an erosion for Democrats among Black voters, which Real Clear Politics co-founder and president Tom Bevan argued was ""a 5-alarm fire for the Democratic Party."" Biden’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid-50s during his first six months in the White House. But the president’s numbers started sagging in August in the wake of Biden's much criticized handling of the turbulent  U.S. exit from Afghanistan  and following a surge in  COVID-19  cases last summer amid the coronavirus' delta variant among mainly unvaccinated people. The plunge in the president's approval was also fueled by the surge in  inflation  and to a lesser degree the dramatic rise over the past year of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along the  southern border . NEW YEAR, BUT SAME OLD POLLING WOES FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN An average of the all the most recent national polls on the president’s standing with Americans compiled by  Real Clear Politics  put Biden at 41%-54% on March 1, the day he delivered the State of the Union address and less than a week after Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine. According to the latest average, the president now stands at 43%-52%. A similar compilation by the polling aggregator and analysis shop  FiveThirtyEight  also showed Biden with a slight bump, from 41%-54% on March 1 to 43%-51% now.

And Anderson told Fox News that ""it’s not a huge change. It’s certainly not like things have done a 360 and now Biden’s on a clear upward trend.

   More than 200 workers have been working at gunpoint since  Russian soldiers  seized the  Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP)  in  Ukraine  on Feb. 24. Overnight shift employees who were supposed to work only for 12 hours have been running operations at the plant for two weeks.  Among the nuclear engineers there is Natalia Ruemmele's 63-year-old father. ""Basically, the power plant is held by people who have no clue about the nuclear security protocols,"" Ruemmele told Fox News via Zoom from Munich, Germany. UKRAINE'S CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DISCONNECTED FROM POWER GRID, SPARKING FEAR OF RADIATION LEAKS For more than 40 hours now, the power has been cut off at the NPP, leaving facilities on reserve diesel generators that ""have a 48-hour capacity,"" according to transmission system operator Ukrenergo. ""After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s barbaric war puts entire Europe in danger. He must stop it immediately,"" Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, calling on the international community ""to urgently demand Russia to cease fire and allow repair units to restore power supply."" Despite the power loss at Chernobyl, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported it ""sees no critical impact on safety.""

       (BlackSky/Handout via REUTERS) Olga Kosharna, an expert in nuclear energy and nuclear safety who previously worked at the State Nuclear Regulatory Authority of Ukraine, said IAEA has been an ""impotent structure which has no mechanisms of influence on an aggressor who violates all international agreements.""  Kosharna said that she believed Russia’s actions at the NPP qualified as a crime under the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and that the International Criminal Court should hear it. Ukrainian intelligence officials said Putin has ordered ""the creation of a technological catastrophe,"" adding, ""the responsibility for which the occupiers will try to blame on Ukraine."" Chernobyl is the site of one of the world’s worst nuclear disasters, where a nuclear power reactor exploded and burned in 1986.

Ruemmele, like many in her hometown of Slavutich, where most Chernobyl nuclear plant employees lived, has been worried about the health and well-being of her father.    Video ""There are no living conditions at the power plant. There is no heating, there are no sleeping arrangements and food is getting scarce. They get a small portion of porridge once a day. If they're lucky, they get some bread as well. Basically, people are hungry,"" she said.  Families have cried out for the hostages' freedom and for the Red Cross to be able to deliver food, medicine and other supplies.

   Ukraine's civilian death toll continues to climb as  Russia's invasion persists , with United Nations officials warning that civilian deaths and ""general human suffering"" are ""rising daily.""  As of Friday, the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Human Rights said Thursday that 1,546 civilian casualties were reported in Ukraine since Feb. 24. The office recorded 564 people  killed in Ukraine and 982 hurt .  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   Video The office has repeatedly noted that it believes casualty statistics are actually ""considerably higher."" It adds that most of the reported civilian casualties ""were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.""  Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said Friday it has verified 29 attacks on health care facilities, workers and ambulances in the hostilities, including a high-profile one on a maternity hospital in southeastern Mariupol on Wednesday. In those, 12 people have been killed and 34 injured, WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said in an email to The Associated Press. The figures from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, which run through the Feb. 24 start, focus on civilians in general. It uses a strict methodology and counts only confirmed casualties. It acknowledges that its tally is likely to underestimate the real toll.

       CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Steven Rattner, a former Treasury Department official under the Obama administration, previously said the spending in President Biden's American Rescue Plan was the ""original sin"" that caused inflation.  ""The original sin was the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, passed in March. The bill – almost completely unfunded – sought to counter the effects of the COVID pandemic by focusing on demand-side stimulus rather than on investment,"" Rattner said in November 2021.

   Stanford University is terminating what appears to be the last remaining active Russian contract among colleges in the United States after Fox News reached out for details and comment on the arrangement.  Stanford entered into a $1.65 million agreement with an unidentified  Russian  entity in December 2020, a search of the College Foreign Gift and Contract Report  database  shows. The three-year agreement contains sparse details, though it notes the funding did not come from the Kremlin. The contract is for ""online access to business-related professional development courses"" and is in ""full compliance"" with U.S. sanctions, Dee Mostofi, Stanford's assistant vice president for external communications, told Fox News on Thursday. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES On Friday, however, Mostofi emailed Fox News saying Stanford now ""is in the process of ending the contract."" Mostofi did not address other questions on the contract, including who in Russia was involved and whether the university plans to take up Russian contracts in the future.

       The Department of Education in 2020  discovered  $6.5 billion in previously unreported foreign money to  universities  from adversarial countries, including  China  and Russia.

The records show the agreement began in October 2014 and runs through June 2022.  UKRAINIAN US COLLEGE GRAD: 'WE JUST HAD TO LEAVE' AFTER RUSSIAN MISSILE STRIKE  However, a University of Illinois spokesperson told Fox News it was a fee-for-service agreement to ""provide DNA sequencing services"" to the Russia-based Evrogen Lab that concluded last month. ""The last samples analyzed under that agreement were received and analyzed in February,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not accepting any new samples for analysis under this contract."" Other universities have also cut student, research and financial ties from Russia, distancing them from the authoritarian superpower. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology severed a research partnership with the Kremlin, and the University of Colorado is liquidating investments in Russian companies, Forbes  reported . The Arizona Board of Regents told the institutions it oversees – Arizona State University, the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University – to sell off their Russian assets,  NBC News  reported. Other schools, like Middlebury College, are  suspending  study abroad programs in Russia.   Like many universities, Stanford also runs a program that sends students to Russia.  The program, called the Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum,  describes  itself as the ""world's only independent research organization that bring students and young professionals from the United States and Russia together to foster understanding between the cultures, share the knowledge, and gain experience in doing collaborative research.""

Forces northwest of the city remain a threat to Kyiv, but according to a senior defense official Friday, they are still roughly 10 miles outside the city. Putin has deployed roughly all the 150,000 troops he amassed on Ukraine’s border in the lead-up to the invasion and despite the loss of at least 700 Russian military vehicles Moscow has maintained about 90% of its combat force.

Just under half of the missiles have been fired from Russia and roughly 80 have been launched from Belarus, a senior defense official confirmed.  Russia has largely focused its invasion in the North, South and Eastern regions of Ukraine. But two cities in Western Ukraine fell victim to Russia’s missile launches Friday.  ""Our assessment is that they struck a couple of airfields in the West,"" Kirby told reporters. ""It's not like there hasn't been any airstrikes in Western Ukraine since the beginning of this operation 16 days ago.

""And, conversely, that Russia has a much higher cost acceptance."" Horrell said Russia's high tolerance for loss, combined with the Kremlin’s doctrine of ""escalate to deescalate,"" could spell trouble for Western Europe.  ""A ship in the Black Sea with the Kalibr land attack cruise missile could reach Berlin,"" Horrell told Fox News. ""If they viewed one of the European capitals as being a weakness in NATO, they could do that sort of escalation, non-nuclear, but they could strike outside the immediate theater of conflict and start hitting native targets.""

578,Weakening Putin requires targeting Russia's oil and boosting US energy production,Sen. Mike Crapo,2022-03-12 11:00:00,"  close     Video   Dems continue to blame Putin for a surge in gas prices   Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy tells ‘Special Report’ how the Biden admin is blaming Putin for gas price hikes while not instituting new policies to remedy the situation. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   More than a third of Vladimir Putin’s budget comes from the sale of Russian oil and natural gas.  Congress  must target that—and more—to hold  Putin  accountable, long term, for his unacceptable aggression against the Ukrainian people.  In addition to banning Russian energy imports, we must revoke favorable trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and provide the President authority to raise tariffs on the other nearly half of imports that Russia sells to the United States. Putin cannot enjoy the same trade status as our NATO allies, and other international partners. Instead, Russia belongs in the same pariah trade status as  North Korea  and Cuba.  The U.S. should also use its influence to deny Russia the trade benefits it enjoys from other countries as a World Trade Organization (WTO) member, since it is denying those very benefits to Ukraine.  WTO members should punish tyrants and war criminals. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES President Biden  recently announced that the United States together with other NATO allies and the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom as well as the European Union will take steps to deny most-favored-nation status to Russia.  As the Republican leader of the Senate Finance Committee, I introduced  bipartisan legislation  with my counterpart, Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), that carries out these objectives by banning the import of energy products from Russia and Belarus, and revoking both countries’ trade benefits.  The President’s announcement reinforces the need for Congress to quickly pass this legislation.

Just three years ago, under  Republican  leadership, the United States had become a net oil exporter for the first time since World War II. Within hours of taking office, President Biden started his campaign against domestic energy production by canceling the Keystone pipeline. A week later, he ordered the Department of Interior to ""pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters.""  While a federal court fortunately blocked this action, the President’s campaign against domestic oil and gas production continues to chill development.  Not surprisingly, a year into his Administration, gas prices for Americans rose 40%, oil imports increased and traditional energy producers at home have faced extensive attacks, while the Administration encourages Iran—a state sponsor of terror—and Venezuela—a brutal communist regime—to produce more.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Enough. Unleash American oil and gas production to replace not only Russian imports—and help stabilize prices at the pump—but to facilitate exports to support our allies, and end their dependence on Russia.  It means jobs at home, stronger allies and a weaker Putin.    Video Congress should counter Russia’s aggression and advance pro-American energy proposals. This includes enacting fellow Senator for Idaho Jim Risch’s NYET Act, which will impose additional real costs on Russia and result in massive economic consequences to Russia’s economy.  I have also co-sponsored the American Energy Independence from Russia Act, Keystone XL Pipeline Construction and Jobs Preservation Act and the Protecting Our Wealth of Energy Resources (POWER) Act, which would reverse a number of President Biden’s onerous actions against the American oil and gas industry and put us back on a better path for energy independence.

   MARIUPOL, Ukraine – Newborn Veronika curled against her mother’s side on Friday, as if to hide from the horror around them — the war that tore apart  the Mariupol maternity hospital  where she was meant to greet the world. On the eve of giving birth, her mother, Mariana Vishegirskaya, had to  flee the hospital when a Russian airstrike hit. Her brow and cheek bloodied, she clutched her belongings in a plastic bag as she navigated down the hospital's debris-strewn stairs in her polka dot pajamas on Wednesday. Images of the desperate mothers and medical workers from the Children's and Women's Health hospital shocked the world, as the bombing took  Russia’s war against Ukraine  to a sickening new level. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Taken to another hospital, Vishegirskaya and another woman who escaped the bombing have since given birth, their babies delivered to the sound of shellfire. A strike hit the new site where they were taken, too. Facing worldwide condemnation, Russian officials made several false claims — that the hospital had been taken over by far-right Ukrainian forces to use as a base and emptied of patients and nurses. The Twitter account for the Russian Embassy in London claimed she was not a victim, but a beauty blogger and model who was posing as two different pregnant women.     
      Mariana Vishegirskaya lies in a hospital bed after giving birth to her daughter Veronika, held by her husband Yuri, in Mariupol, Ukraine, Friday, March 11, 2022. 
       (Associated Press) While Vishegirskaya is a Ukrainian blogger in Mariupol who posts about skin care, makeup and cosmetics, there is no evidence that she was anything but a patient at the hospital. She has posted multiple photos and videos on Instagram documenting her pregnancy in the past few months, and in one, she can be seen wearing the same polka-dot pajamas as on Wednesday. The embassy posted side-by-side images of two Associated Press photos, one depicting Vishegirskaya and another of a woman being carried away on a stretcher, placing the word ""FAKE"" over them in red text. The caption claimed: ""The maternity house was long non-operational"" at the time of the strike. 26 UKRAINIAN HEALTH CENTERS ATTACKED BY RUSSIA, WHO SAYS The embassy followed with a second tweet in which it shared a photo of Vishegirskaya wrapped in a blanket outside the hospital alongside an image from her Instagram account to suggest she was playing a role.

       (Associated Press) AP reporters in Mariupol who  documented the attack in video and photos saw the victims and damage first-hand  – and nothing to indicate the hospital was used as anything other than a hospital. Twitter has since removed the Russian Embassy's tweets, and existing links are directed to a notice that says the posts violated Twitter's rules. The AP was unable to determine the identity of the woman on the stretcher.

On Friday, her husband, Yuri, lovingly held up his daughter, then she was tucked back next to her mother. Vishegirskaya, in same the polka-dot clothing, rested her arm on the bundled-up Veronika.

""I absolutely do support a no-fly zone over the Ukraine,"" Mast told Fox News. He clarified that he doesn’t think anyone ""wants to be in a ground conflict in the Ukraine.""

   Russian  President  Vladimir Putin  has reportedly placed one of his top intelligence officials on house arrest, a move that one expert tells Fox News Digital would be a sign that he is seeking to shift blame for a  Ukrainian  invasion that  U.S.  intelligence believes has not gone according to plan. According to a  report  from the Sunday Times, Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov claims that Putin has arrested the head of the Federal Security Service, Sergey Beseda. Fox News has not independently confirmed this.

       (Reuters) RUSSIA EXPERT: PUTIN 'CORNERED LIKE A RAT' AND WILL DO WHATEVER NECESSARY TO LASH OUT Beseda has reportedly been placed on house arrest along with his deputy Anatoly Bolyukh. The Federal Security Service, known as FSB, is Russia’s top security and counterintelligence apparatus. One former U.S. intelligence officer tells Fox News Digital that the move signals Putin’s dissatisfaction with his intelligence community’s assessment of the Ukrainian invasion. ""It means that Putin is angry and recognized that he was not provided with accurate intelligence,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America"", told Fox News Digital about the significance of the report.

""The formal basis for conducting these searches is the accusation of the embezzlement of funds earmarked for subversive activities in Ukraine,"" Osechkin said in the report. ""The real reason is unreliable, incomplete and partially false information about the political situation in Ukraine."" Koffler believes that Putin has assessed that his inability to capture control of Ukraine in a swift manner has to do with ""poor intelligence"" that has contributed to two major miscalculations.     
      A Ukrainian soldier passes by houses in the village of Novoluhanske, Luhansk region, Ukraine.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Rumors have been swirling about possible martial law coming to  Russia  amid concerns the war in  Ukraine  could prove the boiling crisis that blows the lid off a controlled society, a sort of hybrid police state with Starbucks and vibrant social media. That last bit of description, of course, applied only until very recently, when cheerful young baristas were sent home and Instagram was served its death sentence. Most independent news outlets in Russia have been shuttered with writers now in exile to avoid going to jail for as many as 15 years for crossing the Kremlin's latest and arbitrary ""fake news"" red line. The last journalistic brand of note left standing in Moscow is Novaya Gazeta. Its editor-in-chief won last year's Nobel Peace Prize. Perhaps Novaya is too famous to fail, too feted to flee. But it is now under enormous pressure. The deputy editor told Fox News about the mood in Moscow as he sees it. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   ""It's kind of tragic because we have our society collapsed and no economic hopes, and we also don't see any political future for our homeland, our country,"" Kirill Martynov said. ""We have a lot of pro-war propaganda. It's quite stupid and aggressive. And basically, you start to feel like a person who lives in a kind of occupied land, like it's not your country. It's a country which was occupied by some foreign invaders, some kind of enemy.""     
      A police car is parked in Red Square, with St. Basil's Cathedral in the background, in Moscow, Russia, March 4, 2022. 
       (AP Photo, File) Martynov added that, compared to what Ukrainians are living through, he feels Russians have nothing really to complain about. But still, for many, this is a painful time and is pitting Russian against Russian. ""I feel like all the situation has us on the edge of civil war, basically because hate is rising in Russia,"" he said. ""Propaganda feeds this hate, and we have more and more hate and distrust in Russia."" STATE DEPT. HAS A MESSAGE FOR AMERICANS WHO WANT TO FIGHT IN UKRAINE I put the question everyone wants to know – second only to what is on Putin's mind? – to Martynov: What percentage of Russians support the war on Ukraine? He estimated about 25%. Another quarter – and his answers are based on what he feels – simply support President Vladimir Putin, believing whatever he chooses to do must be right. Another quarter are scared, Martynov thinks, just keeping their heads down and trying to take care of their families. And the last 25% or even less are strongly against this war.

       (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic) I asked Martynov if he thinks anyone in Putin's inner circle is watching the images of Ukraine being broadcast by channels that do not belong to the Russian state. And if so, do they feel badly about the damage, deaths and refugee crisis? ""I feel like there are smart people around President Putin, and I believe that they understand pretty well what happens in Ukraine,"" Martynov said. ""They can see the same as we are, as we still have some, some independent source of information left — YouTube, Telegram and some other social media — which was not completely blocked in Russia for now. But I feel like they have decided that they are war criminals, so they can't break this ties with Mr. Putin."" BIDEN AUTHORIZES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE IN LETHAL AID TO UKRAINE He also believes that the political consequences of the war could mean the dissolution of Russia. ""Or, let's say, the USSR. You feel like in 1991 the USSR was just wiped off the map, the political map, but I feel like it was just an illusion. I feel like in these 30 years the USSR in form of the Russian Federation was still alive. It's still alive.""     
      Map shows Russia's invasion of Ukraine as of March 11, 2022. 
       (Fox News) Novaya Gazeta made the decision to keep working based on feedback from subscribers. It went directly to its readers and asked if its should continue publishing, even if it could not report on the war. It can't report on the war because if it refers to the conflict as a ""war"" or ""invasion"" rather than a ""special military operation,"" it would face punishment.  Novaya's editorial board refuses to mince words. But if the publication were to report a version of events at odds with the official one, its employees would risk jail. It turned out, its readers want it to keep writing about anything it can, about everything else happening in Russia, which under current circumstances, is mostly the fallout from the war, the economy and street demonstrations.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Martynov said the newspaper just put out perhaps its best cover ever showing ballerinas dancing to ""Swan Lake"" against a backdrop of a mushroom cloud. All it says on the cover is ""This edition of Novaya is in compliance with the changed criminal code of Russia.""  The symbolism is strong. Russian state television looped performances of ""Swan Lake"" during the 1991 coup attempt of the Communist hardliners against Mikhail Gorbachev.

The missiles numbered as many as 12, The Associated Press reported. None of the missiles made contact with the consulate, the U.S. official told Fox News.

Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported on Sunday's strike in Iraq but did not say where the missiles originated, the AP reported. But one Iraqi official told the AP the missiles were fired from Iran and were Iranian-made Fateh-110s – and the strike likely represented a response to the Damascus attack.

   Russian  President  Vladimir Putin  is feeling ""cornered like a rat"" as his  Ukrainian  invasion lingers into its third week, a former U.S. intelligence officer told Fox News Digital, and his personal history suggests he will continue to lash out in order to regain the upper hand. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America"", told Fox News Digital on Saturday that an excerpt from Putin’s 2000 autobiography ""First Person"" detailing growing up in a dilapidated Leningrad apartment can be applied to his record as the Russian leader and his current invasion of Ukraine.

When the rat realized he was trapped, he attacked young Putin forcing him to run away in a moment that apparently impacted the future Russian president. Koffler said that the childhood story about the rat, and other stories Putin has approved to be told about his personal life, are a conscious effort to convey to the West that he will always strike back when trapped. ""He wants people to know that when cornered, he will be fighting,"" Koffler told Fox News. ""He will not be surrendering.""

       (Reuters Video) ZELENSKYY ISSUES DEFIANT MESSAGE TO RUSSIA: 'LET THEM COME' In another biography, ""Vladimir Putin: Life History"", Putin is quoted as saying that he learned through neighborhood fights as a child that ""you have to fight to the finish line in every fight"" and ""you need to assume that there is no retreat."" Putin’s predicament began when, according to Koffler, he ""miscalculated"" two major issues related to invading Ukraine by not factoring in the Ukrainian people’s will to fight and the role technology would play in bringing the images of destruction to households across the world. ""He definitely miscalculated and now he feels that he’s trapped because he has to execute this operation and reach his goal."" Koffler explained that Putin watched in horror as the U.S. toppled regimes in Libya and Iraq and fears he might meet the same fate, especially when he hears American leaders claim that he is a deranged madman and call for him to be  assassinated  by his inner circle. Part of the reason Putin is feeling the pressure regardless of any short term victories he may see on the battlefield is that the Russian leader views this fight with Ukraine as a fight for the survival of his country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Author Zbigniew Brzezinski  writes in his book ""The Grand Chessboard"" that ""he who controls Eurasia controls the world"" and Koffler says that Putin very much believes in that notion while also believing that the United States feels the same way.

This is why you see Putin fighting for his life, for survivability.""

       (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) Another factor to consider when discussing the pressure Putin feels, Koffler says, is the current proximity of NATO forces to Russia’s large cities. Koffler explained that during the Cold War, the distance between St. Petersburg and NATO forces was roughly 1,000 miles. Today, that distance is roughly 100 miles. ""By Russian military calculations, they just can't afford this sort of thing because it's a military threat,"" Koffler said.

   Former acting Secretary of Homeland Security  Chad Wolf  exposed the left's anti-Americanism amid the Russia-Ukraine war Saturday on  ""Lawrence Jones Cross Country."" C HAD WOLF:  So what we saw in August was about 83 … billion dollars worth of equipment left in Afghanistan for the Taliban. And at the same time in July of last year, we heard Vladimir Putin talking about his plans for Ukraine. So if you're the Biden administration or the National Security Council, you're putting two [and] two together - you should be - and you should say, ""Hey, some of this equipment that we no longer need, let's start moving that to Ukraine, where they can use it, and they would use it."" But I think what this again signals is the … hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan that we saw. It wasn't planned, it wasn't coordinated. And in effect, we had to leave all of that equipment instead of giving it to our allies and others around the world that we knew could benefit from it at the end of the day.  …  … [W]hen you break it down along party lines, I agree with you that a majority of Democrats would not stay and fight. And I think what this tells you is they don't believe America is worth defending at the end of the day. These are individuals, many of them [who] condemn America, believe it was conceived in sin. They don't fight for our history. They don't want to defend our heritage. They don't want to defend our workers, and they don't want to defend our borders at the end of the day.

   For centuries, Christians have observed  the season of Lent  to honor and remember the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is traditionally done through a reflection on Christ’s life, prayer, abstinence from worldly pleasures and the repentance of sin. ""While views on Lent vary from denomination to denomination, nearly all believers agree that setting aside a period of time to honor and remember the sacrifice of our savior is indispensable to  the Christian life, "" Pastor Lucas Miles, a faculty member at Summit Ministries and the pastor of Nfluence Church in Granger, Indiana, told Fox News Digital in an interview. As  the war in Ukraine rages on , the pastor noted that in 2018, he was part of a special religious delegation that traveled to  Ukraine  to celebrate the anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""I remember being amazed at the massive reception we received of nearly 200,000 Christians gathering to celebrate their freedom in Christ,"" Miles said.  This year, he said, as believers worldwide celebrate Lent, we should ""especially remember our brothers and sisters in Christ affected by the crisis in Ukraine.""     
      This map shows Russia's invasion of Ukraine as of Friday, March 11, 2022. The areas in red indicate the parts of the country that Russian forces have secured.
       (Fox News) Miles said that  Lent is a good time  to meditate on God’s promises. At the heart of Lent is the idea of covenant, or promise from God to man, he noted.  Looking at Old Testament tradition and scripture, Miles pointed to Genesis 15:6, in which God establishes a covenant with Abram: ""Abram believed the Lord, and he [God] credited it to him as righteousness.""  FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT: REFLECT, REPENT AS ‘SIN AND DARKNESS’ SHOW THEMSELVES Over 2,000 years before Christ’s birth, Miles said, the scriptures foreshadow the gift of righteousness available through Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross. Miles explained the Old Testament history of covenant, noting that in those times, ""a blood covenant was a binding agreement between two parties. Together, they would dig a shallow trench into the earth and line it with the carcasses of slain sacrificial animals.""     
      A man is shown deep in prayer in this image. During Lent, Christians all over the world reflect on the life of Jesus and all that he gave us through his sacrifice on the cross. 
       Miles continued, ""As the blood from the carcasses dripped into the trench, the two parties joined hands and walked between the pieces, signifying that failure to keep the covenant would grant the other permission to do unto the other what had been done to the animals.""  This is the type of covenant that God made with Abram — known as the ""Abramic Covenant,"" explained Miles.  LENT'S EMBER DAYS: RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR POINTS TO NEED FOR ‘RECONCILIATION’ ""In the account of Abram’s covenant with God, what is unique is that although God made this covenant with Abram, Abram himself never walked through the trench,"" he said.     
      Ash Wednesday, on March 2, 2022, marked the beginning of the season of Lent this year. During this time of war in Ukraine, Christians all over the world are keeping the Ukrainians and all others affected by violence and conflict on their minds and in their prayers.
       (Getty Images) ""Instead, the Bible tells us that Abram ‘fell into a deep sleep’ and had a vision of ‘a smoking firepot and a blazing torch’ passing between the pieces.""  Miles said Christians believe that this points to the idea that the covenant was made ""spiritually"" between the ""Father and the God-man Jesus Christ — rather than Abram himself,"" although Abram benefited from it. ASH WEDNESDAY, START OF LENT: TURN TO GOD This is further exhibited in the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament, said Miles, through the account Jesus’ transfiguration. Here, he reveals his divine nature to disciples Peter, James and John — as well as his future sacrifice on the cross.      
      During this season of Lent, so many people are praying for the people of Ukraine. Shown here, a couple talks after people rushed to board a Lviv-bound train in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, on Feb. 28, 2022. 
       (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) Luke 9:29-30 reads, ""As he [Jesus] was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.""  Pastor Miles further explained, ""If our righteousness depends upon our ability to maintain a covenant with God, none of us would have any hope of salvation.  For Christians, however, this isn’t the case. With Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, he faithfully fulfilled man’s end of the agreement with God.""   Video Saying that when Jesus ""accepted a punishment that we justly deserved, we were saved by grace,"" Miles noted that Christ became both ""the sacrificial lamb as well as the man accepting a binding agreement with the Father."" To ratify the covenant with God in the Old Testament, Abram had to be asleep, noted Miles.  But Luke's chapter 9 tells us that Peter, James and John ""became fully awake"" to see the glory of Jesus Christ before them. ""In this glory of the person of Christ is our hope of redemption,"" said Miles.     
      Pastor Lucas Miles of Indiana talked to Fox News Digital this week about the season of Lent. Sunday, March 13, marks the second Sunday of Lent this year. ""As believers,"" said the pastor, ""we join with Ukraine, praying for God's protection over their lives.""
       (Krissy Miles) ""During this Lenten season, as the world rages mad all around us, may each of us become fully awake to behold the glory and goodness of our Lord, who gave his life as a sacrificial lamb so that we could enjoy eternal security and life in his name.""

   Has  President Biden  lost liberal comedian Trevor Noah, host of  Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show"" ? In an opening monologue during the week, Noah expressed frustration about a Wall Street Journal report that said Biden’s calls to  Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – seeking  support for Ukraine  and help with surging U.S. gas prices – were rejected. Noah claimed that rejected phone calls were one thing that Biden’s predecessor – former President Donald Trump – never would have had to deal with. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""You have got to be kidding me,"" Noah  told viewers Wednesday night . ""Apparently, Saudi Arabia won’t even pick up the phone for the president of the United States.  ‘Biden is asleep by 4 p.m.’ ""I mean, look, I know it’s hard to arrange those calls. You know, Riyadh is eight hours ahead, Biden is asleep by 4 p.m., it’s a narrow window to make it work, but still: That must have been really embarrassing for Biden. Can you imagine? He phones them and they don’t pick up?"" ""You have got to be kidding me. Apparently, Saudi Arabia won’t even pick up the phone for the president of the United States.""   — Trevor Noah, ‘Daily Show’ host Noah continued later: ""Now, according to the White House, this story is totally untrue. They deny it, which I would too. But either way, man, there is no denying that Saudi Arabia isn’t playing ball with Joe Biden. And you know what? You can say what you want, but this would have never happened to  Donald Trump . Never. ""Now, according to the White House, this story is totally untrue. … But either way, man, there is no denying that Saudi Arabia isn’t playing ball with Joe Biden.""   — Trevor Noah, ‘Daily Show’ host     
      Trevor Noah is seen at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, March 14, 2021.
       (Associated Press) ""No one was ever ignoring Donald Trump’s calls. ‘Cause if you ignored Donald Trump’s calls, you didn’t know how he would respond. Maybe he’d send an angry tweet, or maybe he’d just, like, ban your country from everything.

According to the Wall Street Journal story, which was published Tuesday, the Mideast phone snubs of Biden happened as both countries were becoming increasingly critical of Biden administration policies in the Persian Gulf region.     
      President Biden, left, drew a different reaction from Persian Gulf nations than former President Trump would have drawn, Trevor Noah argued.
       (Getty Images) On Feb. 9, Biden managed to get a phone conversation with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, the 86-year-old father of Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but was unable to speak directly with the leader known as ""MBS."" ""There was some expectation of a phone call [with MBS], but it didn’t happen,"" a U.S. official told the Journal. The Saudis have been seeking more support from the U.S. for their involvement in Yemen’s civil war as well as help with their own nuclear program to keep pace with Iran, the Journal reported. In addition, the Saudis are also seeking legal immunity for MBS in connection with the 2018 killing of writer Jamal Khashoggi,  the report said . Inadequate US response? The Emiratis, meanwhile, have concerns of their own about Iran – and they and the Saudis viewed as inadequate the recent U.S. response to missile strikes by Iran-backed militants in Yemen against Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the Journal reported. On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the Journal's report of Biden's phone calls being denied was ""inaccurate,"" Yahoo News reported.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Bombing a maternity hospital, shelling residential buildings, firing on fleeing refugees, and destroying any infrastructure that supports the lives of innocent civilians … are all  war crimes under international law.    Whoever is involved in the chain of command that gave the orders – all the way up to the head of state – can and should be charged. This means  Russian President Vladimir Putin  must be indicted for war crimes.       
      Russian President Vladimir Putin (AP, File)
       There is no question about who issued the orders. The invasion of Ukraine and the cruel bombing campaign cannot be blamed on a  rogue Russian general . It was organized and directed by Putin himself. He admitted as much in his maniacal vows to destroy his perceived enemies in neighboring Ukraine.   WEAKENING PUTIN REQUIRES TARGETING RUSSIA'S OIL AND BOOSTING US ENERGY PRODUCTION Historically, the gathering of incriminating evidence has been both difficult and time-consuming. Perpetrators cover up their crimes and witnesses are reluctant to speak out in fear for their own lives. But the atrocities in Ukraine are different.   On a daily basis, the world has watched in real time many of the war crimes committed by the military forces that Putin controls. Thanks to modern technology, the evidence has been collected by reporters with cameras, as well as Ukrainians on their cellphones or other devices. Satellite images confirm the death and destruction.      Video The compilation and authentication of the damning evidence is no longer an obstacle as it once was. It has already been communicated electronically throughout the world and stored. We have watched it unfold with our own eyes.    The appalling video of the bombings as they happened, photographs of mangled bodies of women and children, pictures of mass graves, and the personal accounts of the carnage by those who watched in horror constitute self-evident proof.   In the city of Mariupol alone, some 1,200 civilians were slaughtered. That number seems to rise by the hour. The names of the victims and how they were massacred by Putin’s heavily armed troops have been meticulously recorded.    The UN should establish a special tribunal, just as it did for the mass atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.   In all, 18 health care facilities in Ukraine have been bombed in the Russian onslaught. Stores, schools, apartments, orphanages, markets, pharmacies and private businesses have been obliterated. The measure of human suffering and bloodshed is memorialized in searing images and documents.  Putin’s crimes fall into three separate, but related categories spelled out by international law.   The first is called ""crimes against humanity."" It is defined as ""a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population."" Invading a sovereign nation without provocation and deliberately killing non-combatants, including women and children, clearly qualifies. So does Putin’s use of cluster bombs and his admitted deployment of thermobaric explosives that rupture the lungs of any civilians nearby.     Video The second is known as ""war crimes."" They, too, involve the willful killing of civilians, inhumane treatment, destruction of property and intentionally causing great suffering. The barbarity of Putin’s military actions meets this definition. Millions of civilians have fled as entire communities have been laid to waste by indiscriminate bombings – their lives and livelihoods shattered.   The third offense is identified as ""crimes of aggression."" This encompasses any unjustified attack or invasion by armed forces, bombardment, military occupation of territory and annexation. Again, this has been established.   The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, has announced that it opened a war crimes investigation. That may sound impressive, but the track record of the court is not. The ICC is notoriously hobbled by inertia, dysfunction, weak management, endless jurisdictional disputes and feeble prosecutions.     Video A better idea is for the United Nations to circumvent the ICC and establish a special tribunal, just as it did for the mass atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s. In that case, 161 people were indicted for their crimes, including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.  Yes, Russia would veto the creation of a special tribunal in a vote by the five-member U.N. Security Council. But the General Assembly has the power to override the veto under a rather obscure provision called resolution 377. The language affords sufficient latitude.   A United Nations vote should be undertaken with dispatch and the criminal tribunal organized. Since the evidence already exists, Putin and his cronies could be charged expeditiously.    Video Placing Putin in the dock to account for his heinous crimes is a more vexing matter. The tribunal itself would have no police power to effectuate his arrest in Russia where the dictator is protected – for now.   This means it will be up to the Russian people. The case of Milosevic is instructive. Massive anti-war demonstrations against his brutality eventually drove him from office, as up to 200,000 members of his military deserted him. Milosevic was arrested by his own people and carted off to the special tribunal to stand trial.   The same fate could befall Putin if the citizens of Russia grow tired of his authoritarian rule and his suppression of their human rights. With economic disaster looming, they may in the near future rise up in anger against him. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER If Russians continue to suffer the dire effects of their own devolving financial situation and if living conditions deteriorate to unbearable levels, fury toward Putin could grow exponentially. Their willingness to tolerate a tyrant who has rained death and terror on Russia’s neighbor in his lust for power may reach a breaking point.   Video Desperate conditions merit desperate actions by the people. Poverty and hunger drive revolutions. It has happened twice before in Russia in the last century. History could and should repeat itself.   It is undeniable that Putin is an evil dictator who continues to commit monstrous acts in Ukraine. No sentient person would argue otherwise.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Putin is plainly guilty of the despicable war crimes that I have described. And no, I will not grant him a presumption of innocence. But the special tribunal will.   Time is of the essence.

But Trump's far from the only potential Republican White House hopeful to stop in the state over the past year.      
      Former Vice President Mike Pence takes part in a 'fireside chat' with approximately 400 pastors gathered at the First Baptist Church of Columbia, in Columbia, South Carolina on April 29, 2021.
       (Fox News) The other possible contender who's made the most visits - former Vice President  Mike Pence , who's scheduled to return to the Palmetto State twice this spring. Wilson spotlighted that anyone interested in running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination ""recognizes the importance of South Carolina"" and ""how important South Carolina is to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue becoming your place of residence."" Pence grabs spotlight with stop in Ukraine  Pence met on Thursday with Ukrainian refugees flooding into Poland as they escaped  Russia's  military assault of their country. Pence, who has condemned Russian leader  Vladimir Putin ’s deadly invasion, was in  Ukraine  along its border with Poland.  ""The impact of the Russian invasion on these families is heartbreaking and the need for support is great,"" Pence  emphasized in a tweet . Pence was accompanied by his wife, former second lady Karen Pence. The two traveled to the region with Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian humanitarian organization. They were joined by the group’s vice president of operations, Edward Graham, who’s the son of the organization’s president, the nationally known evangelical pastor Franklin Graham. Pence, who’s mulling a 2024 GOP presidential nomination run, was on an overseas trip that also took him to Israel on Wednesday. PENCE MEETS WITH WAR REFUGEES DURING VISIT TO UKRAINE-POLAND BORDER The former vice president a week ago made headlines regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, when he told a Republican National Committee gathering of top donors that ""there is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom."" A Republican source in the room at the appearance by Pence in New Orleans, Louisiana, told Fox News that the line received applause from the audience at the event, which was closed to press. Pence didn’t refer to Trump by name in his comments, but his targeting of those in the GOP who haven’t fully condemned Putin follows multiple remarks made last month by Pence’s former boss describing Putin’s ""genius"" and ""savvy"" in launching the attack. But Trump has also argued that he was ""tough"" on Putin during his four years in the White House and has repeatedly claimed that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president. In recent days the former president’s also described the horrific pictures of Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians as a ""holocaust. Nikki Haley headed to New Hampshire Former two-term South Carolina  Nikki Haley , who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the first two years of the Trump administration, will return to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of  New Hampshire  early next month to campaign with a former official in Trump’s State Department who’s running for Congress. The trip by Haley, which was first reported by Fox News, will spark more speculation about her possible national ambitions.  FIRST ON FOX NEWS: NIKKI HALEY RETURNING TO FIRST PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY STATE Haley will spend April 4 in New Hampshire, teaming up with Republican congressional candidate Matt Mowers at multiple stops including a fundraiser in the southern town of Salem. Mowers is one of the top contenders in the crowded GOP primary in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, a longtime premiere House swing district that the GOP’s aiming to flip from blue to red in November’s midterm elections.     
      Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley campaigns with GOP congressional candidate Matt Mowers in Bedford, New Hampshire, in October of 2020.
       (Matt Mowers campaign) The stop in New Hampshire will be Haley’s first since October 2020, when she campaigned with Mowers during his first bid for the seat. Mowers won the GOP nomination but lost the general election to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas by five points. The two-term Democratic incumbent is running for reelection again this year. Pompeo back in Iowa  Former Secretary of State  Mike Pompeo  returned to  Iowa  on Friday night for the second time in a month. And it was Pompeo’s fourth trip over the past year to the state whose caucuses for a half century’s kicked off the presidential nominating calendar. Pompeo, a former congressman from Kansas who served as CIA director and later as America’s top diplomat during former the Trump administration, headlined an Iowa GOP fundraising dinner in eastern city of Davenport along with former longtime Hawkeye State Gov. Terry Branstad, who served as ambassador to China under Trump. Fox News learned last month that Pompeo   will head back to Iowa again in April for events in the western part of the state. POMPEO HEADS BACK TO IOWA FOR FORUM ON AMERICA'S GLOBAL STANDING Asked about 2024, Pompeo, told Fox News last summer in Iowa that ""my wife and I will pray and we’ll think our way through it and when we hit 2023, we’ll figure our way through it."" Iowa’s lead off position takes incoming fire at DNC meeting While Pompeo was in Iowa, the state’s lead off status in the Democratic presidential nominating calendar was facing serious scrutiny at a meeting of the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) Rules and Bylaws Committee Friday evening in the nation’s capital. While there were no final decisions – that will likely come at the DNC’s summer meeting later this year – many of the party members who spoke at the gathering were clearly open to reordering the presidential nominating calendar to better reflect the party’s growing diversity and values. WITH TWO YEARS UNTIL CAUCUSES, LITTLE GOP APPETITE TO UPEND PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATING CALENDAR The knock against Iowa and New Hampshire – among some Democrats – for years has been that the states are too White, lack any major urban areas, and aren’t representative of a Democratic Party that’s become increasingly diverse over the past several decades. Nevada and South Carolina are much more diverse and have larger metropolitan areas than either Iowa or New Hampshire.     
      FILE - The Iowa Caucuses exhibit in Des Moines, Iowa
       (Fox News) And Nevada Democrats last year passed a bill into law that would transform the state’s presidential caucus into a primary and aim to move the contest to the lead-off position in the race for the White House, ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire. Compounding Iowa's issues was the botched reporting of the 2020 caucuses, which became a national and international story, and an embarrassment for Iowa Democrats as well as the DNC. Among those speaking at the meeting was DNC member Mo Elleithee, who’s long been a proponent of shaking up the calendar. He emphasized there’s a need for changes, ""not four years from now — now."" ""I think states like New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina can make a compelling argument as to how they fit into that picture,"" Elleithee, who’s also a Fox News contributor, said. ""I have a harder time seeing it with Iowa, but Iowa should have the right to make that case to us."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Causing controversy ahead of the meeting was a leaked DNC draft proposal, which called for having all the early voting states reapplying for their place in the nominating calendar, with an emphasis on diversity and holding primaries over caucuses. While there’s plenty of drama regarding the DNC’s 2024 calendar, there’s apparently little desire at the Republican National Committee (RNC) to make alterations. At last month’s winter meeting, which was held in Salt Lake City, Utah, was the unanimous passage by an RNC panel of a report that makes no changes to the traditional top of the party’s presidential nominating calendar.   ",2022-03

   Russian  forces took a second  Ukrainian  mayor captive, Ukrainian officials said Sunday.  Russian ""war criminals"" abducted Yevhen Matveyev, mayor of Dniprorudne, a city in the Vasylivka Raion of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba.  ""Getting zero local support, invaders turn to terror,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""I call on all states & international organizations to stop Russian terror against Ukraine and democracy. RUSSIA INTEL OFFICIAL'S REPORTED ARREST REVEALS PUTN'S WAR FRUSTRATION, EXPERT SAYS: LIVE UPDATES  Matveyev is the second Ukrainian mayor reportedly captured by Russian forces advancing in the region.  Ivan Fedorov, mayor of the nearby city of Melitopol, was abducted on March 11, Kuleba said Saturday.  ""Russian war criminals abduct democratically elected mayors of Ukrainian towns,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""Locals hold protests demanding to free him.""  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Western nations that communicate with Moscow – France, Germany, Israel and others – Saturday to help him free Fedorov,  saying in an address , ""I'll talk to whoever I need to talk to in order for our people to be freed.""  Zelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about the issue.  His address came hours after Ukrainian Parliament announced Fedorov had been captured, saying a group of 10 ""occupiers"" put a plastic bag on the mayor’s head in Melitopol’s crisis center.  ""This is yet another example of the illegal, cynical and barbaric acts perpetrated by the Russian armed forces in the context of their reckless and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine,"" European Parliament said in a  statement  in response to Fedorov’s abduction. ""We call on the Russian military authorities to free Mr. Ivan Fedorov immediately and to ensure that his health and safety is preserved. We urge the Russian authorities to fully respect the Geneva Conventions on combatants and non-combatant civilians and prisoners of war, as well as all relevant provisions of International Humanitarian Law.""  ""These are not only legal obligations for the Russian Federation, but they represent the collective moral obligations of the international community, including the citizens of Europe and Russia,"" the statement said, adding that violations of basic rights of civilians and attacks against civilian infrastructure ""will not be forgotten and all perpetrators of such acts will be pursued under international law.""  Russian state-run media reported Saturday that prosecutors in Luhansk, a breakaway area recognized by Moscow in Ukraine’s disputed Donbas region, was preparing terrorism charges for Fedorov, accusing him of raising funds for far-right groups, the New York Times reported. Zelenskyy, who is Jewish and lost relatives to the Holocaust, said kidnapping Fedorov was intended to further Russian President Vladmir Putin’s unsubstantiated claims that Russian forces need to invade to liberate the Ukrainian people from neo-Nazis.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Melitopol, located northeast of the Russian annexed Crimea, came under fierce fighting on the first day of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. It has since been occupied by Russian forces, and Fedorov had been posting regular social media updates encouraging resistance, providing lists for which ATMs were still working, where to purchase milk and medicine and warning that looters would be punished.  ""We are not cooperating with the Russians in any way,"" he said in an interview with the BBC two days before he was abducted. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us and we do not want their help.""  ",2022-03
611,Rooftop Revelations: Pastor Brooks takes on Joy Reid’s racialization of the Ukraine War,Eli Steele,2022-03-13 09:02:00,"  close     Video   DAY 113 WITH PASTOR COREY BROOKS    NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   CHICAGO –  On the 100th day of his rooftop vigil to build a community center, Pastor Corey Brooks decided not to come off the roof because he had not reached his fundraising goal. He raised $10 million in the first 100 days, an accomplishment that still left him short of his $35 million goal. After a two week break, ""Rooftop Revelations"" resumes on the 113th day and the pastor wished to share his thoughts on Joy Reid and how she reduced the Ukraine-Russia war to race. What follows has been lightly edited. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear the pastor in his own words. Like many concerned Americans, I have been following the war that Russia launched upon Ukraine. Matter of fact, it's pretty much all that we've been talking about on this rooftop on the South Side of  Chicago .  The one thing that has been so inspiring for us is to see how bravely and strongly these Ukrainians are fighting for their freedoms — freedoms that many of us in  America  take for granted. We know what will happen to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters if they lose the war to Russia. Lose the war, lose your freedoms. Freedom, I believe, is everything. Nothing else matters.  That's why it troubles me tremendously when people like Joy Reid reduce the freedom struggle of the Ukrainians down to the lowliest of human values: race. People like Joy Reid seem incapable of seeing anything beyond the racial lens. It's all that she has. Race is her power. JUSSIE SMOLLETT SENTENCING: LEGAL EXPERTS WEIGH IN AFTER ACTOR LEARNS FATE On her show, Joy Reid recently accused Americans of ignoring wars featuring people of color, like the Yemen war, in favor of wars fought by whites and Christians. She said, and I quote, ""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts.""  Does anyone seriously think that Joy Reid covered the Yemen war in the past? I mean, it's been going on for years. And if Joy Reid has covered it, then where is the coverage? I haven't seen it, if any.  I bet she didn't cover it any serious way because she couldn't make it about race.  Just like so many others, race is her power, her substance. Race is a reductive force that bypasses human complexities for the overly simplistic values that we project onto skin colors. In asking us to ignore human complexities, race makes us liars out of us. And by imposing her views of race onto the Ukrainian-Russian war, Joy Reid attempted to make the war about herself, her views of race. And that is worth what? That is why I've steadfastly refused to play the race card. Race is not my power. My intellect, and my ability to understand complex issues like the Ukrainian conflict, that's my power, not race.  There are some of you that may say, ""What about the Africans being denied entry into other nations?"" I condemn those acts of racism. At the same time, don't you know that Poland has taken in over 100 different nationalities in the last three weeks. While racism may have played a part, we must also ask if nationalism and citizenship issues played a role as well.  Also, I've read stories of visitors to the Ukraine describing their experiences. One of the stories I came across was a woman on Twitter who said she visited a (Ukraine) hotel several years ago. When the clerk saw her Armenian name, she told the guest that she was not welcome there. The hotel manager overheard it and fired the clerk on the spot and told her never come back. He then told the Armenian woman that her hotel stay had been comped.  Ukraine, like America, doesn't have the perfect past. What Ukraine did to the Jews during the Holocaust was simply horrific. But because I believe in the ability of our civilization to evolve, to progress, to move beyond the sins of the past, I must give the Ukrainian people credit for evolving to become a modern nation with modern sensibilities. They have fought for freedom over and over since the end of the cold war and today they are in the fight to death for their freedoms. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Those who do not move beyond the past, those who hold on to past grievances, those who do not rise to join the modern world — those people have nothing to offer us. Instead of building themselves into a superpower nation, Russia invaded Ukraine in the name of a long-gone empire. Instead of doing her job and looking into the complexities of the war, Joy Reid reduced the war down to race because she had nothing else to offer.  For Joy Reid, I believe attacking whites is her bread and butter. She's absolutely nothing without race.  And now here is the supreme irony of all this. Joy Reid blasted us for ignoring wars involving brown and black people. She professes to care so much about brown and black people. I then must ask why hasn't she ever come into my community to talk about the daunting problems we deal with every single day? Why hasn't she come here to learn for herself how our plans for a community center can transform so many lives? Why hasn't she come here to share her wisdom with us on the South Side of Chicago? She milks our pain for her paycheck yet she never visits us. She never talks about us. So that is why Joy Reid's complaint about the Ukraine war rings so hollow with me. And that is why on the South Side of Chicago, I choose to fight for opportunities for my brothers and sisters instead of playing the meaningless race game that gets us absolutely nowhere. I know some are going to be mad, some are going to be upset, but I stand by what I say and what I believe.

Tensions flared in the summer of 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas in the Mediterranean where Greece and Cyprus claim their own exclusive economic zone, leading to a naval standoff. Turkey also claims Greece is violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. Since then, Greece has embarked on a major military modernization program.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the White House, the Pentagon, and the State Department have all denied Russian allegations that the U.S. funded biological weapons in existing Ukrainian laboratories near the border.  Graham dismissed concerns about a third world war if the U.S. sends jets to Ukraine, accusing the Biden administration of dragging their feet because they cannot see an outcome in which Putin loses.  ""It’s not going to be WWIII. This is all a bluff. Putin knows that no one wins a nuclear exchange,"" he said. ""If he ordered a preemptive strike on the United States, some general would shoot him in the head.""  ""If we go all in to crush the Russian economy, if we help the Ukrainians with the weapons they need, we should be taking every Soviet bloc country with S-100, S-200, S-300, any aircraft missile systems and flood them into the Ukraine to regain control of Ukrainian skies,"" Graham added. ""I think the Ukrainians can win but what breaks my heart is that it appears to me that Biden is more worried about Putin losing that Ukraine winning. And that is despicable and sad.""   Graham said he also fears a deal that would divide Ukraine and accept Russian control of half the country.  ""I smell a sell-out coming when it comes to Ukraine,"" he said. Ukraine and Israel both denied reports that Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had encouraged Zelenskyy to cede to Moscow’s demands. Israel is brokering potential negotiations between Russian and Ukraine to happen in Jerusalem.  SECOND UKRAINIAN MAYOR CAPTURED AS RUSSIAN INVADERS TARGET ELECTED POLITICIANS: UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL  Regarding proposals of neutrality for Ukraine, Graham said Putin ""does not want a neutral Ukraine,"" but rather he wants to ""eradicate Ukraine."" Graham said Putin spoke in a speech last year of taking not only Ukraine, but also Moldova, Georgia and all the regions around Russia to reestablish the Soviet Union.   ""I would be dead set against any deal that would require the Ukrainian people to recognize half of the Ukraine belongs to Russia by force of arms,"" Graham said. ""And if there’s any chemical weapons used by Putin, that would be a war crime and I would be supportive of a no-fly zone as response to that.""  ""You see war crimes being committed in front of you on television every day, and the Biden administration looks at Putin as a partner for climate change and an Iran dealmaker rather than a war criminal,"" Graham said. ""Biden’s more afraid of Putin losing than he is excited about Ukraine winning.""

""Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine.

Continuing in a thread of tweets, Levy said their thoughts and prayers were with Renaud's family, calling the journalist ""a brilliant filmmaker and wonderful colleague."" ""Brent had worked for a number of American media organizations in the past, including HBO, NBC and The New York Times,"" Levy said.

   Across the border from  war -engulfed  Ukraine , tiny, impoverished Moldova — an ex-Soviet republic now looking eagerly Westward — has watched with trepidation as the  Russian  invasion unfolds. In Gagauzia, a small, autonomous part of the country that’s traditionally felt closer to the Kremlin than the West, people would normally back Russia, which they never wanted to leave when Moldova gained independence. But this time, most have trouble identifying with either side in the war. Anna Koejoglo says she’s deeply conflicted.

       (AP Photo/Sergei Grits) Koejoglo is one of Moldova’s 160,000 Gagauz, an Orthodox Christian people of Turkic origin who were settled there by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. They make up over 80% of Gagauzia’s population, but only 5% of Moldova’s 2.6 million people. In the early 1990s, when landlocked Moldova voted to leave the Soviet Union, its Gagauz and Russian minorities wanted to stay. But unlike Russian-backed separatists in eastern Moldova who took up arms in 1992 to establish the unrecognized, breakaway Trans-Dniester area — which Russia essentially controls, maintaining some 1,500 troops there — the Gagauz in the south chose to compromise. JACK KEANE SAYS RUSSIA WORKING TO ‘ENCIRCLE’ KYIV THEN ‘HAMMER’ THE CAPITAL: 'SLAUGHTER THE PEOPLE' In 1994, they reached an agreement with the government in Moldova’s capital, Chisinau, settling for a high degree of autonomy. Still, Gagauzia has maintained a strong relationship with Russia, where many Gagauz find education and job opportunities. Its population generally opposes the pro-Western shift embraced by ethnic Moldovans who account for 75% of the country’s people. For Peotr Sarangi, a 25-year-old Gagauz, the old ties still hold strong. ""(The) Gagauzian population supports Russia more, many remain pro-Russian,"" he said.

   Despite President Biden's promise not to involve U.S. troops in the war between  Russia  and  Ukraine , a miscalculation from either side during the tense struggle could risk dragging NATO into the conflict. The fear of a deadly escalation in the conflict has been at the center of the Biden administration's response in recent days, with the Pentagon last week  denying a request  from Ukraine to transfer Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to the country's armed forces through the U.S.'s Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

       PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS ""The intelligence community has assessed that the transfer of MiG-29s may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. ""Therefore, we also assess the MiG-29s to Ukraine to be high-risk."" But perhaps the largest risk to an escalation of the conflict would be a no-fly zone enforced by NATO, something Heritage Foundation Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy John Venable told Fox News Digital would be an unlikely risk for NATO to take. ""The complications associated with establishing a no-fly zone are enormous and would involve more risk than NATO or the US would accept under almost any circumstance,"" Venable said.     
      Russian President Vladimir Putin
       (Yuri Kochetkov/Pool/Associated Press) Author and former DIA intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital Thursday that a no-fly zone presents the most risk among known scenarios, but currently-unknown actions could inadvertently cause an escalation during the ""fog of war."" ""Usually the path of the escalation is difficult to predict, it can come out of nowhere in the fog of war,"" Koffler said.  Koffler argued that the current conflict in Ukraine is a ""proxy war"" between the U.S. and Russia that could easily escalate into a ""shooting war.""  ""It is so easy for both sides to misinterpret each other's intentions,"" Koffler said.

""The Russians are predisposed to worst-case scenario, their intelligence assessments say that a war between the U.S. and Russia is inevitable, they already believe it,"" Koffler said. Koffler argued that any number of steps the U.S. may take in Ukraine could be interpreted by the Russians as escalatory, noting that Russian intelligence agencies rely on an algorithm with multiple inputs to assess what their adversary's next move might be. That means even small steps taken by the U.S. could be seen as a preparation for war.  Russian military doctrine would then call for the Kremlin to strike the first blow in an attempt to gain the strategic advantage, Koffler noted, adding that the Russians are aware their forces are incapable of competing with U.S. troops in a conventional conflict.     
      President Joe Biden
       (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Some of Russia's paranoia about the U.S. stems from previous American military operations, Koffler said, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein.  ""They have assessed that the United States is a high-risk adversary because we routinely conduct military operations to topple regimes such as Saddam,"" Koffler said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Venable believes the best way to avoid a military conflict is to keep applying pressure on Russia to pull its forces out of Ukraine, arguing that Russia losing the war could actually cause them to escalate the situation further. ""If Putin continues to get boxed in through sanctions, trading and banking stoppages -- and he starts losing the war, that may be reason enough for him to employ tactical nuclear weapons,"" Venable told Fox News Digital. ""The West needs to continue to apply pressure, attempt to broker a settlement/cease-fire while continuing to offer off-ramps that deescalate the potential"" for a conflict between NATO and Russia.

   Sen. Tom Cotton , R-Ark., explained the connection between the ongoing  Russian invasion of Ukraine  and recent talks by  President Biden  to revive the nuclear deal with Iran. As Russia continues their invasion into Ukraine, the Biden administration has been trying to negotiate a  new nuclear deal  with  Iran . Despite Biden's rhetoric of isolating Russia from the world community for its actions in Ukraine, the country is still a major player in Iran nuclear talks. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES     
      
       (Fox News) ""The failed Iran nuclear deal is closely related to Russia’s war on Ukraine,"" Cotton said. ""For the last year, Joe Biden has been essentially relying on Vladimir Putin to be his lawyer at these negotiations, trying to deliver through Vladimir Putin a new nuclear agreement with Iran, which would be worse than even the terrible deal Barack Obama got in 2015. It would allow Iran to be a threshold nuclear state, while giving them hundreds of billions of dollars to continue their reign of terror in the Middle East."" ""Perhaps Joe Biden should stop negotiating with the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism and start holding them accountable,"" he added. "" Sunday Night in America "" host Trey Gowdy expressed shock that the White House is continuing to negotiate with Russia and Iran.

       (AP Photo/Florian Schroetter, FILE) ""That was the failure in 2015 with Barack Obama’s deal. It put Iran on the path to being a nuclear power. It didn’t even impose many obligations on them. This deal would be even worse. I think Joe Biden feels he could trust Iran to keep its end of the bargain because it doesn’t even have any responsibilities under what we’ve been hearing,"" Cotton said. Cotton also remarked that part of the deal would also involve lifting sanctions from Iran despite several human rights violations.  ""They face sanctions because of their support for terrorism, their human rights abuses. So I guess Joe Biden’s plan is that the Ayatollahs will uphold their commitments when their commitments are essentially zero,"" he added.

   MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's show account on Twitter was forced to delete a segment of a guest comparing  Russian President Vladimir Putin  to Adolf Hitler after it was  fact-checked by the Auschwitz Memorial. Appearing on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" last week, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and Stanford University Professor Michael McFaul provided a more favorable view of the Nazi dictator, echoing a Ukrainian reporter who claimed that Putin was showing increased aggression compared to Hitler because the Russian dictator is killing his own people.

He slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate,"" McFaul said.  The segment was later shared by the Maddow Blog on Twitter, with the caption, ""One difference between Putin and Hitler is that Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans, German-speaking people. Putin slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate."" The remarks prompted  immediate backlash  on social media, eventually catching the attention of The Auschwitz Memorial. ""On a factual note: Hitler did kill ethnic Germans & German-speaking people: those who opposed the Nazi regime, those who resisted, those who did not fit into the ‘Weltanschauung,'"" the Auschwitz Memorial account replied to the show's tweet after the interview. By late Saturday, the show had taken down the post, and issued a correction emphasizing that contrary to what McFaul asserted, Hitler did indeed kill ""millions of Germans."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The historical record is clear,"" the show tweeted. ""Hitler killed millions of Germans.

That decision certainly helped convince Putin that he didn’t need to fear America under the Biden administration.  However, the roots of  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  go much further back. It was the Obama-Biden administration that did not help Ukraine push back Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea. It was that same Obama-Biden administration that began a war on American energy that continues to this day. During that same time, Russia was using its energy resources to dominate Europe and finance a major military buildup around Ukraine.   Video When Putin violently annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine looked to the United States for help. Unfortunately, the  Obama-Biden administration  rejected their request for lethal assistance like Javelin anti-tank missiles because they were afraid of offending Russia and only provided non-lethal assistance like blankets.   BIDEN CAN ONLY BLAME HIMSELF FOR HIGH GAS PRICES In direct contrast with his predecessor, President Trump approved the sale of $47 million worth of lethal aid to Ukraine in December 2017. This included more than 200 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 missile launchers that, over the past two weeks, have proven vital in the Ukrainian military’s defense against overwhelming Russian forces.     Video As Russia steadily massed its military forces on Ukraine’s border in 2021, a $200 million security assistance package for Ukraine went to President Biden for consideration. However, just like the failed decision of the Obama administration, President Biden delayed the actual delivery of the assistance for crucial months.   The equipment in this security package was just being delivered to Ukraine in February as Putin was launching his invasion. Stinger surface-to-air missiles, a top priority for Ukraine, were left out of the first package and not authorized by the Biden administration until after Russia’s assault on Ukraine began. While Putin inflicts increasing numbers of civilian casualties by bombing schools and hospitals, President Biden is still failing to heed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s calls for help.  Putin’s barbaric attacks on Ukraine can be traced to Europe’s scorn for fossil fuels and nuclear power.   Europe did not become energy-dependent on Russia overnight. Putin’s barbaric attacks on Ukraine can be traced to Europe’s scorn for fossil fuels and nuclear power. Through his efforts to make the United States more like Europe, President Biden has ensured that European countries cannot turn to our abundant resources to drive down natural gas prices and cut free from Russian energy.   Biden has played into Putin’s hands by ending American energy independence and renouncing U.S. oil and gas resources. While the U.S. could meet all of Europe’s energy needs, Europe receives nearly 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Without alternative energy suppliers, European families will suffer from over-reliance on Russia because of European leaders’ shortsighted Green New Deal policies.     Video The United States should not follow Europe’s failed approach. We can again be a global energy leader, and provide reliable, low-cost energy for American households and our friends around the world.  Last week, Republican leaders, including more than 80 members of the House Energy Action Team (HEAT), sent a letter to President Biden laying out specific actions he can take immediately to reverse Russia’s leverage on Europe and the United States. Before he invaded Ukraine, Russian energy sales to the U.S. and Europe were providing more than $700 million a day to fund Putin’s war. We called on the Biden administration to ramp up U.S. energy production to lower prices for American families, eliminate Putin’s revenue stream, and ensure greater energy security here at home and to our allies overseas.     Video President Biden last week finally agreed with us to ban Russian oil, natural gas and coal imports. However, instead of turning to American energy producers to replace that tyrant’s oil, President Biden issued more attacks on American energy companies and instead turned to dictators in countries like Venezuela and Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, to meet our energy needs.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER President Biden needs to stop begging foreign dictators to sell us their oil and, instead, finally say yes to American energy production.    Video All Americans should ask – why won’t Biden unleash America’s energy industry? In his first days in office, the president killed the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have employed thousands of Americans and provided a crude oil source from Canada instead of Putin’s Russian crude. Democrats love to talk about how they are committed to reducing carbon emissions but fail to admit that the United States emits much less carbon to produce oil and natural gas domestically compared with the other countries that President Biden is begging to produce energy because we have much higher standards than those adversarial countries.   President Biden’s disastrous leadership has crippled the United States’ power and influence on the world stage. When the United States is no longer energy independent, our country and the world become more vulnerable and more dependent on bad actors.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sadly, we are seeing now how the Biden administration’s far-left energy policies have made Russia richer and emboldened Vladimir Putin.   Under President Trump, the United States demonstrated strong leadership at home and abroad. President Biden can act now to unleash American energy and turn the tables on Russia so that the United States and our allies re-establish the energy security we deserve.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

   The Biden administration’s hell-bent pursuit of a new nuclear deal with Iran grows harder to understand with each provocation from Tehran. The latest came Sunday in a missile attack near a U.S. consulate under construction in northern Iraq. Iran typically commits mayhem through proxy militias, but this time Tehran took credit. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the regime’s paramilitary group, said it carried out a missile attack on what it claimed were Israeli targets inside Iraq. The group said it was in response to an Israeli airstrike in Syria last week that killed two IRGC commanders.

   A U.S. official said  Russia  asked  China  for military equipment to use in its invasion of  Ukraine , a request that heightened tensions about the ongoing war ahead of a Monday meeting in Rome between top aides for the U.S. and Chinese governments. In advance of the talks, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from global sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. ""We will not allow that to go forward,"" he said. The prospect of China offering Russia financial help is one of several concerns for President Biden. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that in recent days, Russia had requested support from China, including military equipment, to press forward in its ongoing war with Ukraine. The official did not provide details on the scope of the request. The request was first reported by the Financial Times and The Washington Post.

       (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) The Biden administration is also accusing China of spreading Russian disinformation that could be a pretext for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces to attack Ukraine with chemical or biological weapons. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the U.S. and European Union. China needs access to those markets, yet it also has shown support for Moscow, joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with ""no limits."" In his talks with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi, Sullivan will indeed be looking for limits in what Beijing will do for Moscow.

       (Frederic J. Brown/Pool via AP) ""I’m not going to sit here publicly and brandish threats,"" he told CNN in a round of Sunday news show interviews. ""But what I will tell you is we are communicating directly and privately to Beijing that there absolutely will be consequences"" if China helps Russia ""backfill"" its losses from the sanctions. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world,"" he said. CHINA IS ‘BIG WINNER’ OF RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR, FORMER FBI AGENT WHO WORKED IN CHINA WARNS In brief comments on the talks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian did not mention Ukraine, saying that the ""key issue of this meeting is to implement the important consensus reached by the Chinese and U.S. heads of state in their virtual summit in November last year."" ""They will exchange views on China-U.S. relations and international and regional issues of common concern,"" Zhao said in comments posted on the ministry's website late Sunday. The White House said the talks will focus on the direct impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine on regional and global security. Biden administration officials say Beijing is spreading false Russian claims that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. They say China  is effectively providing cover  if Russia moves ahead with a biological or chemical weapons attack on Ukrainians. When Russia starts accusing other countries of preparing to launch biological or chemical attacks, Sullivan told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ""it’s a good tell that they may be on the cusp of doing it themselves."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, on ABC's ""This Week,"" said ""we haven’t seen anything that indicates some sort of imminent chemical or biological attack right now, but we’re watching this very, very closely."" The striking U.S. accusations about Russian disinformation and Chinese complicity came after Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova alleged with no evidence that the U.S. was financing Ukrainian chemical and biological weapons labs. SECOND UKRAINIAN MAYOR CAPTURED AS RUSSIAN INVADERS TARGET ELECTED POLITICIANS: UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL  The Russian claim was echoed by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who claimed there were 26 bio-labs and related facilities in ""which the U.S. Department of Defense has absolute control."" The United Nations has said it has received no information backing up such accusations. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the claims ""preposterous."" There is growing concern inside the White House that China is aligning itself with Russia on the Ukraine war in hopes it will advance Beijing’s ""vision of the world order"" in the long term, according to a person familiar with administration thinking. The person was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Sullivan told ""Face the Nation"" on CBS that the Russian rhetoric on chemical and biological warfare is ""an indicator that, in fact, the Russians are getting ready to do it and try and pin the blame elsewhere and nobody should fall for that."" The international community has assessed that Russia used chemical weapons in attempts to assassinate Putin detractors such as Alexei Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal. Russia also supports the Assad government in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war. China has been one of few countries to avoid criticizing the Russians for their invasion of Ukraine. China's leader Xi Jinping hosted Putin for the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, just three weeks before Russia invaded on Feb. 24. During Putin's visit, the two leaders issued a 5,000-word statement declaring limitless friendship. The Chinese abstained on U.N. votes censuring Russia and has criticized economic sanctions against Moscow. It has expressed its support for peace talks and offered its services as a mediator, despite questions about its neutrality and scant experience mediating international conflict.

Sullivan said China and all countries are on notice that they cannot ""basically bail Russia out ... give Russia a workaround to the sanctions,"" with impunity. Chinese officials have said Washington shouldn’t be able to complain about Russia’s actions because the U.S. invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The U.S. claimed to have evidence Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction though none was ever found. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On CNN, Sullivan said the administration believes China knew that Putin ""was planning something"" before the invasion of Ukraine. But he said the Chinese government ""may not have understood the full extent of it because it’s very possible that Putin lied to them the same way that he lied to Europeans and others."" Sullivan and Yang last met for face-to-face talks in Switzerland, where Sullivan raised the Biden administration's concerns about China's military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, and efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. That meeting set the stage for a  three-hour - long virtual meeting  in November between Biden and Xi. Sullivan is also to meet Luigi Mattiolo, diplomatic adviser to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, while in Rome.  ",2022-03

   There's evidence that sanctions have worked to secure U.S. foreign policy interests in the past, but experts are underwhelmed by the response to  Russia's invasion  of  Ukraine . President Biden has ruled out a no-fly zone in Ukrainian airspace and vowed that there would be no military confrontation between U.S. and Russian troops outside of NATO soil while incrementally increasing sanctions against the Kremlin’s interests over the past two and a half weeks. ""The totality of our sanctions is crushing the Russian economy,"" the president tweeted Friday. ""The ruble has lost more than half its value.""

       (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   But Russian troops haven’t backed out of Ukraine. Rich Goldberg, an advisory board member at the Vandenberg Coalition and former director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction for the White House National Security Council, said the incremental approach hasn’t deterred Putin but has ""scared the h--- out of the market"" instead. ""We have driven up the price of oil with half measures that have not achieved our objectives,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Sanctions need to be tailored for the appropriate situation to have the desired impact, achieve a certain outcome. Not all sanctions are alike. Not all sanctions are created equal, and not all situations merit the same type of sanctions response."" UKRAINE MOUNTING PRESSURE CAMPAIGN TO KNOCK OFF NY STOCK EXCHANGE BUSINESSES THAT PAY TAXES TO RUSSIA That means that the right sanctions applied to the right circumstances can lead to concrete results, he said. ""An example would be the Trump administration issuing sanctions against senior Turkish officials, which tanked the lira and forced Turkey to release  Pastor [Andrew] Brunson ,"" Goldberg said.

       (Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS) Brunson, an American, had been living in Turkey for decades when he was arrested on politically motivated ""terrorism"" charges, prompting the U.S. to demand his release and place sanctions and tariffs on Turkish officials and goods. HOW CAN AMERICANS DONATE TO UKRAINIAN MILITARY EFFORTS? In order to combat Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Goldberg said, the U.S. would need to dramatically step up its sanction game, cutting off all Russian banks — not just some — from the international SWIFT transfer system. A decade ago, he said, the world oil market was able to stabilize despite a ""maximum pressure campaign"" of sanctions on Iran. Buyers could still purchase Iranian oil, but the payments were held in escrow rather than being sent back to Tehran. Meanwhile, U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia increased production. ""If you wanted to try to design sanctions that would have maximum impact on Putin today and Russia today and over the long term, while trying to minimize the boomerang effect on the U.S. economy or on our allies in other parts of the planet, you could apply the same model to Russia,"" he said. UKRAINIAN PROFESSOR AND TECH CEO NOW BATTLING RUSSIAN CYBERATTACKS FROM FALLOUT SHELTER However, President Biden has both failed to impose such sanctions and struggled to shore up similar support from allies in the Persian Gulf this time around, in part because before the invasion of Ukraine, Biden had been cold toward them.

""This was driven partly by domestic politics inside the Democratic Party that wanted to shun Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, and a strong Iran lobby in Washington."" One issue there was the prince’s alleged role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the U.S. He was killed in Turkey in 2018. The Biden administration said last year that bin Salman had approved plans to ""capture or kill him."" The U.S.-Saudi relationship was shored up during World War II under the understanding that the U.S. would offer security guarantees in exchange for oil production help, Goldberg said. ""That played an important role at the end of World War II, that played a crucial role in the Reagan victory strategy to bring down the Soviet Union, and it played a vital role in our sanctions policies over the last decade against Iran,"" he said. PUTIN TELLS RUSSIAN MOMS ‘I UNDERSTAND YOUR WORRY‘ AMID INVASION OF UKRAINE Now without help from oil-producing allies, little interest from Democrats in increasing U.S. energy production and ""half measure"" sanctions against Russia, the Kremlin has stepped up violence in Ukraine, allegedly killing civilians and bombing hospitals while troops encircle the capital city, Kyiv. Clint Ehrlich, a foreign policy analyst and Russia expert, said the sanctions currently imposed on Russia have actually served to boost Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s popularity at home while prompting his citizens to ""rally around the flag."" ""People who are hit by sanctions know where those sanctions are coming from,"" Ehrlich told Fox News Digital. ""It's not a mystery for them why their economies are suffering, and they don't place the blame on their governments for the policies that led to the sanctions. They place their blame on the countries that are administering the sanctions."" US VOWS TO HALT GASLIGHTING AFTER RUSSIA ASKS UN SECURITY COUNCIL FOR SPECIAL MEETING ON BIOLABS IN UKRAINE And that means more support for the invasion of Ukraine, at least for now, he said. ""Especially after 2014, when we put Russia on notice that It needed to prepare to become self-sufficient,"" Ehrlich added. That’s when Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region, which it has occupied ever since. Since then, he said, Putin’s government has dramatically increased Russia’s agricultural production. ""That’s the most important thing from the perspective of sanctions,"" Ehrlich said. ""Consumer electronics, brands, people can do without."" The capacity to produce food, however, puts Russia on strong footing, he said. UKRAINE MILITARY KILLS A TOP RUSSIAN GENERAL Sanctions have worked in past situations, he agreed, but they haven’t halted the violence in Ukraine. ""Sanctions were effective against South Africa to end apartheid,"" he said. ""That’s the classic example."" However, South Africa wasn’t an aspiring superpower and had far fewer resources, he said. Russia is a massive supplier of global energy, including to some of Europe’s wealthiest economies. A green-minded, anti-nuclear government like Germany’s backing away from its energy deals with Russia would be like ""if the GOP had to suddenly become pro-Obamacare,"" Ehrlich said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, he added, the fighting in Ukraine has led to Russia putting some demands on the table that could be the basis for a realistic end to the violence. Those include backing away from Ukraine’s ambitions to join the Western NATO alliance, legitimizing Russia’s control over Crimea, and granting autonomy to pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, along the countries’ shared border.

   A growing and bipartisan group in  Congress  is pushing  President Biden  to facilitate the transfer of Poland's MiG-29  fighter jets  to Ukraine amid Russia's brutal invasion, despite statements by the U.S. military that such a move would be high-risk, low-reward.  The White House is leaning on that position from the military in its opposition to providing the jets, including that Ukraine does not really need the aircraft. But Biden already ceded to pressure from Congress to take a tougher stance against Russia multiple times since the war started. And dozens more members from both parties Sunday called on the president to help Ukraine get its hands on the Polish fighter jets President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is petitioning for.  ""We, the 58 members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, urge continued U.S. commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine and the freedom of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia’s ongoing invasion,"" the moderate, bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus (PSC) said Sunday.

Then it leveled even more sanctions targeting Russia's financial institutions after pressure from Congress. Then Congress pressed for a ban on Russian oil imports. The House was going to pass a bill to that effect before Biden finally announced the ban last week.  Now, after initially signaling an openness to helping make the MiG-29 transfer happen, the White House appears to have shut the door on the possibility, to the chagrin of many in Congress.  The problem is, how do you get them to Ukraine without it raising the involvement of NATO… Once that plane takes off from Poland.

He and another journalist were reportedly headed to Irpin to take photos of refugees fleeing the area and were offered a ride. Initial reports said Russian forces fired upon their car, but Fox News has not independently confirmed who fired.  WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT  Pravda Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, shared a video on Telegram purportedly showing the wounded American journalist lying on a hospital bed in the capital, telling a spokeswoman for the Okhmatdyt Hospital recording him that he was separated from his colleague, Renaud, who was left behind. Ukrainian Parliament also shared the video on Twitter.   The man, who said his name was Juan and he was from the U.S., described how both he and Renaud approached a second bridge in the car and crossed a checkpoint near Irpin when they were fired upon.  Speaking while medical staff attended to his wound, he said he was brought to the hospital by an ambulance and did not know the status of his colleague. Initial reports  identified  him as Juan Arredondo, and an  Instagram account  with the same name said he was a journalist for National Geographic and an adjunct professor at Columbia University.  Fox News has not independently identified him or his employment status, and requests for comment to NatGeo and Columbia went unanswered Sunday.

       (Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Peabody Awards) In an appearance on CNN Sunday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he just heard reports about an American journalist killed before coming on air and still needed to confirm information.  ""If in fact an American journalist was killed, it is a shocking and horrifying event,"" Sullivan told CNN host Dana Bash. ""It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces. They’ve targeted schools and mosques and hospitals and journalists. And it is why we are working so hard to impose severe consequences on him and to try to help the Ukrainians with every form of military assistance we can muster to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces.""  The Main Directorate of the National Police in Kyiv Region first tweeted photos purportedly showing a bloodied Renaud, his U.S. passport and his photo ID badge for The New York Times enclosed in a holder labeled U.S. peacemaker. In another video from the scene of the shooting, Ukrainian police officer Alexander Bugai said that in addition to 51-year-old Renaud being killed, two others were wounded.  It wasn’t immediately clear if a third journalist was shot or if it was the driver of the car injured. A graphic photo included in the post appeared to show a gunshot wound that pierced Renaud’s skull.  According to his bio on IMBD, Renaud was a Peabody and DuPont Award winning filmmaker and spent the past two decades producing films and television programs with his brother Craig.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Renaud Brothers are best known for telling humanistic stories from the World's hot spots and their projects have covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the earthquake in Haiti, political turmoil in Egypt and Libya, the fight for Mosul, extremism in Africa, cartel violence in Mexico, and the youth refugee crisis in Central America,"" according to the biography.  Their work has won many of the top awards in television and journalism, including a Peabody Award, two Columbia DuPont Awards, two Overseas Press Club Awards, an Edward R.

   Both the  Ukrainian  pregnant woman seen in a viral photo being carried out on a stretcher after  Russian  forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol and her baby have died, according to a report.  The Associated Press captured photos and video of the publicly unidentified woman – lying on a stretcher beneath a watermelon patterned blanket with an empty look on her face while clutching her lower abdomen – as rescuers carried her through the rubble.  Trees were destroyed and debris strewn on the ground. Behind them, windows were blown out on the badly damaged façade of the hospital in an image that shocked the world and exemplified to Western officials the horrors of Russia’s aggression toward civilians.   RUSSIA, UKRAINE WAR: MATERNITY AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOMBED, MARIUPOL ‘BESIEGED’ BY RUSSIA INVADERS  The woman was rushed to another hospital, yet closer to the frontline, where doctors labored to keep her alive. Realizing she was losing her baby, medics said, she cried out to them, ""Kill me now!"" Surgeon Timur Marin found the woman’s pelvis crushed and hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed ""no signs of life,"" the surgeon told the AP.  Then, they focused on the mother.

In the chaos after Wednesday’s airstrike, medics didn’t have time to get the woman’s name before her husband and father came to take away her body, according to the AP. At least someone came to retrieve her, they said — so she didn’t end up in the mass graves being dug for many of Mariupol’s growing number of dead.  In a city that’s been without food supplies, water, power or heat for more than a week, electricity from emergency generators is reserved for operating rooms. Diplomatic negotiations have failed to secure humanitarian corridors for Mariupol's some 400,000 civilians to escape heavily shelling by the Russians. Theft has become widespread and photos have shown dead bodies strewn across city blocks.  Accused of war crimes, Russian officials claimed the maternity hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian extremists to use as a base, and that no patients or medics were left inside. Russia’s ambassador to the U.N. and the Russian Embassy in London called the images ""fake news."" UKRAINIAN WOMAN WHO SURVIVED BOMBING GIVES BIRTH TO BABY GIRL  AP journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the attack and said they saw the victims and damage firsthand.  They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward, medics shouting, and children crying. The AP team then tracked down the victims on Friday and Saturday in the hospital where they had been transferred, on the outskirts of Mariupol.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)   ( (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)) The AP reported last week that a different pregnant woman – see in viral photos with a bloodied face fleeing the damaged maternity hospital down a flight of stairs in a polka dot pajama set, carrying a blanket and several bags – had survived and delivered a baby girl.  After the bombing, the woman, identified as Mariana Vishegirskaya, was taken to another hospital on the outskirts of the city, facing the front line, and gave birth via cesarean to baby Veronika Thursday.  On Friday, her husband, Yuri, lovingly held up his daughter, then she was tucked back next to her mother, according to photos and accounts from AP journalists.  ""It happened on March 9 in Hospital No. 3 in Mariupol. We were laying in wards when glasses, frames, windows and walls flew apart,"" Vishegirskaya, still wearing the same polka dot pajamas as when she fled, told The AP. ""We don’t know how it happened.

She has posted multiple photos and videos on Instagram documenting her pregnancy in the past few months, and in one, she can be seen wearing the same polka-dot pajamas as on Wednesday. Twitter has since removed the Russian Embassy's tweets, and existing links are directed to a notice that says the posts violated Twitter's rules.

   Vladimir Putin’s strategy is ""escalation without an endgame,"" the White House said Friday. Don’t you believe it. Putin knows what he wants: to catch  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  and take Kyiv.  As the CIA revealed last week,  Putin expected a two-day war . Then came Zelenskyy. Two heroic weeks of unexpected fighting raised hopes, but now the battle for Kyiv is on and Putin is more determined than ever. And there’s very little left for the U.S. and NATO to do, since the alliance is paralyzed by escalation fears.     
      Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin
       (Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images  |  Getty) Like you, I've watched with grim satisfaction as  Russia tripped up on maneuvers , stalled convoys, inept tank tactics and more. The ""video of Russian tank units near Brovary running away will be engraved in the memory of the whole world,"" praised Ukraine’s defense minister on Friday.   PUTIN WANTS KYIV AND TIME'S RUNNING OUT TO SUPPLY UKRAINE BEFORE BRUTAL CITY FIGHT That phase of Russian indecision is over. Putin is going after Kyiv the ugly way.  Putin has cranked up Russian firepower, with more ground-based missiles and airstrikes. Russian ground forces crept closer to Kyiv and the famous ""stalled convoy"" woke up and dispersed into the woods, the Pentagon reported Wednesday.    Video Last week this could have been stopped with NATO airpower. Now the war comes down to a close-in fight. Here’s what to expect. From Putin:  Russia’s fighting mode is all about long-range firepower. Russian forces will take up artillery positions of relative safety and fire down on Kyiv.  Next, Russia will continue to move smaller armored units – tanks – into Kyiv’s suburbs, heading for roads and bridges and testing Ukraine’s resistance. Look at the map. You can see how Russian forces already form pincers from east and west.    Video Russia will try to choke off supplies to Ukraine’s military. Today, there are still 14 countries sending in supplies by road, rail and air. To the west, Russia will intensify new attacks on remaining airfields and other sites as with the strikes on Lutsk and the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk. Don’t forget there are three more nuclear power plants Russia doesn’t hold yet.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Putin’s changed tactics and he is no rush. Remember Putin pushed the siege of Grozny from mid-October 1999 until February 2000. It was a lot like Ukraine: massive artillery, reconnaissance patrols, and a bloody ending with Chechen rebels gunned down in a minefield. When it was over, the U\.N. described Grozny as the ""most destroyed city on earth."" From Zelensky:  The Ukrainian president's top job right now is to remain optimistic and let Ukraine’s military and civilians see they still have a chance to defeat Russia.  On Friday, Zelensky praised Ukraine for holding out 16 days, four times longer than predicted, and encouraged Ukrainians to go ahead with spring planting. That’s optimism!   Video But Zelensky’s military options are dwindling. His best tactic is to continue launching counter-attacks at multiple locations against the Russian tanks and patrols probing into Kyiv. The Javelin anti-tank missiles being successfully used by Ukraine reach about two miles and can be fired from inside buildings. They lock on the Russian target then pop up a few hundred feet to dive down and hit from above. Ukraine’s outnumbered defenders must harass and hit Russian resupply vehicles, too.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ukraine may drag out the fight until top Russian generals tell Putin they need more troops and supplies to take and hold Ukraine. But if Zelenskyy loses contact with supply lines outside Kyiv, he may choose an organized retreat of some Ukrainian forces and government functions out of Kyiv. ""Putin must fail,"" proclaimed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It would be nice to hope that the world might somehow intervene to impose a cease-fire. Unfortunately, Putin’s nuclear blackmail took 30 NATO nations off the chess board.  On the streets of Kyiv, it will be up to Zelenskyy to win or lose the war.

   Russia's  military forces kept up their  punishing campaign  to capture Ukraine's capital with fighting and artillery fire in Kyiv's suburbs Monday after an airstrike on a military base near the Polish border brought the war dangerously close to NATO's doorstep. A new round of talks between Russian and  Ukrainian  officials raised hopes that progress would be made in evacuating civilians from  besieged Ukrainian cities  and getting emergency supplies to areas without enough food, water and medicine. Air raid alerts sounded in cities and towns all around the country overnight, from near the Russian border in the east to the Carpathian Mountains in the west, as fighting continued on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces shelled several suburbs of the capital, a major political and strategic target for an invasion in its 19th day. Ukrainian authorities said two people died and seven were injured after Russian forces struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine’s largest aircraft manufacturing plant and is best known for producing many of the world’s biggest cargo planes. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-story apartment building in a northern district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said. Firefighters worked to rescue survivors, painstakingly carrying an injured woman on a stretcher away from the blackened and still smoking building.

Shells also fell on the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting in Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital, regional administration chief Oleksiy Kuleba said on Ukrainian television. The surrounded southern city of Mariupol, where the war has produced some of the greatest human suffering, remained cut off despite earlier talks on creating aid or evacuation convoys. A pregnant woman who became a symbol  of Ukraine’s suffering when she was photographed being carried from a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol has died along with her baby, the Associated Press has learned. Images of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher had circled the world, epitomizing the horror of an attack on humanity’s most innocent. RUSSIA ASKED CHINA FOR MILITARY, ECONOMIC AID IN UKRAINE CONFLICT FOLLOWING INVASION Ukraine announced plans for new humanitarian aid and evacuation corridors on Monday, although ongoing shelling caused similar efforts to fail in the last week. A fourth round of high-level discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials was set for Monday, the first negotiations in a week, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. The talks were to take place by video conference. The previous rounds were held face to face in Belarus. Monday's meeting will be a ""hard discussion,"" Podolyak wrote on Twitter. ""Although Russia realizes the nonsense of its aggressive actions, it still has a delusion that 19 days of violence against (Ukrainian) peaceful cities is the right strategy.""

       (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) The hope for a breakthrough came the day after Russian missiles  pounded a military training base  in western Ukraine that previously served as a crucial hub for cooperation between Ukraine and NATO. UKRAINIAN POLICE OFFICER IMPLORES CORRESPONDENT TO 'TELL AMERICA' WHAT RUSSIANS DID TO 'A JOURNALIST' The attack killed 35 people, Ukrainian officials said, and the base's proximity to the borders of Poland and other NATO members raised concerns that the Western military alliance could be drawn into the largest land conflict in  Europe  since  World War II . Speaking Sunday night, Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  called it a ""black day"" and again urged NATO leaders to establish a no-fly zone over his country, a move the West has rejected for fear of starting a direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. RUSSIA ‘BROADENING’ TARGET SET AFTER AIRSTRIKE ON WESTERN UKRAINIAN AIRBASE NEAR POLAND BORDER: PENTAGON ""If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries,"" Zelenskyy said, urging Russian President  Vladimir Putin  to meet with him directly, a request that has gone unanswered by the Kremlin. The president's office reported Monday that airstrikes hit residential buildings near the important southern city of Mykolaiv, as well as in the eastern city of Kharkiv, and knocked out a television tower in the Rivne region in the northwest. Explosions rang out overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson. Three airstrikes hit the northern city of Chernihiv overnight, and most of the town is without heat. Several areas haven’t had electricity in days. Utility workers are trying to restore power but frequently come under shelling.

       (Ukrainian State Emergency Service via AP) While Russia’s military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine’s, Russian troops have faced stiffer than expected resistance, bolstered by Western weapons support that has frustrated  Putin . With their advance slowed in several areas, they have bombarded several cities with unrelenting shelling, hitting two dozen medical facilities and creating a series of humanitarian crises. Ukraine said Moscow's troops failed to make major advances over the past 24 hours. The Russian Defense Ministry gave a different assessment, saying its forces had advanced 11 kilometers (7 miles) and reached five towns north of Mariupol.

The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said the death toll includes at least 85 children are among them. Millions more people have fled their homes, with more than 2.7 million crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries.

The fight for the southern city of Mariupol is crucial because its capture could help Russia establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. The International Committee of the Red Cross said suffering in Mariupol, where missiles struck a maternity hospital Wednesday, was ""simply immense"" and that hundreds of thousands of people faced extreme shortages of food, water and medicine. ""Dead bodies, of civilians and combatants, remain trapped under the rubble or lying in the open where they fell,"" the Red Cross said in a statement. ""Life-changing injuries and chronic, debilitating conditions cannot be treated."" WHITE HOUSE AXED PLAN TO TRAIN UKRAINIANS IN GUERRILLA WARFARE FEARING IT MAY PROVOKE RUSSIA: REPORT Russia also expanded its assault on Sunday to western Ukraine, striking the  International Center for Peacekeeping and Security near Yavoriv , a military base which has long been used to train Ukrainian soldiers, often with instructors from the United States and other NATO members. More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the site. In addition to the 35 deaths, 134 people were wounded in the attack, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said. The base is less than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Polish border and has hosted NATO training drills, making it a potent symbol of Russia’s longstanding fears that the expansion of the 30-member Western military alliance to include former Soviet states threatens its security — something NATO denies.

   Sen. Ron  Johnson , R-Wis., joined ‘ The Faulkner Focus ’ Monday stressing the need for the U.S. to prevent  China  from supporting Russian military action against  Ukraine . Johnson emphasized how China is ‘playing a very dangerous game’ by standing alongside Russia in any capacity amid their invasion into Ukraine.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES SEN. RON JOHNSON:  China is worried about their image, and they need to understand that their image is being tarnished even further by literally their lack of response. They should be forcefully coming out against what Russia doing. But they're not. Now, can we decouple from China overnight? No, but you begin the process. In many respects. We have begun the process, you know, as wages have increased in China. Manufacturers have moved out of China as China has become more authoritarian. As people perceive a greater risk of doing business with China, manufacturers move out of China. That would just continue. I think that would probably pick up speed. China's playing a very dangerous game, staying pretty much mute as it comes to the atrocities in the war crimes committed by, I guess, their friend, Russia.  WATCH THE FULL VIDEO BELOW:   Video  ",2022-03

   The Hill was slammed by critics over the weekend for using the phrase ""Republicans seize"" to describe efforts by the party to criticize  President Biden  and the  Democrats  over the rapidly rising cost of gas. In a Saturday piece headlined ""Republicans seize on rising gas prices amid Ukraine conflict,"" The Hill dusted off the age-old cliché as it appeared to lament down-ballot Republicans across the country using the soaring cost of refueling a vehicle ""to go on the offensive"" against Democrats, in turn posing a challenge for the president's party heading into this year's midterm elections. NEW YORK TIMES KNOCKED FOR USING ‘REPUBLICANS POUNCE’ FRAMEWORK ON SCHOOL ISSUE ""Republicans running in down-ballot races are using soaring gas prices to go on the offensive against Democrats, posing a challenge for President Biden and his allies on the campaign trail,"" The Hill wrote.  ""Biden and Democrats were already contending with record inflation and rising gas prices well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but Republicans have used the latest price hike to tie their opponents to what they argue is a lack of energy independence under the Biden administration,"" it added.  The Hill went on to cite analysts claiming high gas prices were a result of ""supply and demand mismatches related to the coronavirus pandemic,"" rather than a result of the Democrats' policies. It argued that Republicans had grown ""more aggressive"" following the invasion of Ukraine in trying to pin the blame on Democrats and quoted DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison, who claimed the former were politicizing the issue with their criticism.

Others argued gas prices were affecting all Americans and not just those of a particular political party. ""Pretty sure everyday Americans of any ideology have been ‘seizing’ and suffering from rising gas prices long before the Ukraine conflict,"" one critic wrote.

   In  World War II, Winston Churchill  famously declared, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."" It appears that there may be even fewer to count on if a recent poll is accurate.  The Quinnipiac University poll asked Americans, ""What would you do if you were in the  same position as Ukrainians  are now, stay and fight or leave the country?"" Only 55% said that they would stay and fight for this country. That included only 40% of Democrats.

       (Alexey Furman/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Overall 38% of Americans said that they would flee. It appears that this country is facing an existential crisis of faith, and we should have a frank discussion about why so comparably few Americans are now willing to pledge their lives in  defense of this country . UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY VS. RUSSIA'S PUTIN – WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE BATTLE FOR KYIV Quinnipiac has long been relied upon in polling in the United States and is one of the most cited polling outfits for the media. It is important to note that, while the results were shocking overall, many did say that they would stand and defend the United States from any invader. When asked this question, 68% of Republicans and 57% of Independents say that they would fight. However, more than half of Democrats (52%) said they would flee before fighting for their country – 8% did not have an answer, a shrug that is equally alarming.   Video As someone who came from a liberal, Democratic family in Chicago, I was shocked by the poll. My father and grandfather fought in the World Wars and everyone I grew up with on the liberal Northside of Chicago was both intensely liberal and intensely patriotic. Indeed, I often heard my parents challenge Republican friends for suggesting that conservatives were more patriotic or more willing to sacrifice for their country. For my maternal Sicilian family, they felt a deep bond to the country that took them in and allowed them to live in freedom. Despite the prejudice that they encountered and difficult times, my Sicilian grandparents celebrated Independence Day like a religious holiday and often discussed their pride when they became American citizens.  If you are not willing to defend this country, citizenship becomes a status of convenience.   My grandfather was a union organizer and a coal miner who developed black lung in the mines of Ohio. He could not read or write, but he could proudly recite parts of the Declaration of Independence and our national anthem. We should be alarmed by this poll because it shows a deep disconnection with this country and its protection. If you are not willing to defend this country, citizenship becomes a status of convenience; an opportunistic association that can be shed as easily as it is acquired. It is a commitment that extends little beyond annual tax obligations.   Video Notably, the poll did not pose a question over what might be viewed as an unjustified war in another land like Vietnam. This question asked about an invasion of our country. Indeed, despite the opposition to Vietnam, many Democrats and liberals still felt obligated to answer the call for service when drafted. The poll shows a crisis within the Democratic Party, but also our country at large, with people losing their connection to our common article of faith, the Constitution. That did not occur overnight. There have been unrelenting attacks on our institutions and core values for years that ignore our countervailing successes. We have gone through terrible periods and faced terrible institutions and practices, from slavery to segregation. However, we faced them as a people united in a common faith captured in the Declaration of Independence:   Video ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. – That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed..."" We have not always lived up to those principles. Indeed, when those words were written, millions were left in slavery and millions were barred from voting, property ownership and other basic rights of citizenship. However, we became better than we were due to a faith in ourselves and our common constitutional bound. This is just one poll and people can have different motivations in answering such questions. However, there was clearly a desire by many to convey this disconnection with the country in their answers that suggest something more than just impish responses.     
      Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks during a meeting of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on June 12, 2019, on Capitol Hill. 
       (Alex Wong/Getty Images) There has been a growing agnosticism regarding this country as many challenge our foundational institutions and values. It is captured in words of leaders like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who questioned the very need for the Supreme Court when it was not ruling in line with her own views: ""How much does the current structure benefit us? And I don’t think it does.""  That is a worthy debate to have, and our Constitution protects all sides in having it. Yet, there is an underlying message that, because our institutions did not produce the results demanded by Ocasio-Cortez, we are told to scrap them.  Elie Mystal, who writes for the Nation and Above the Law, called the Constitution ""kind of trash."" In his new book, ""Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy’s Guide to the Constitution,"" Mystal says we should just ignore what the Framers thought or said. When asked ""Are you arguing that the Constitution needs to be scrapped altogether?"" Mystal said he would be ""all for"" a move to ""throw out"" the Constitution. Others, including lawyers, agreed with Mystal and declared ""the Constitution is trash."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It is a crisis of faith shown in academics like Georgetown Professor Eddie Glaude insisting that we need to scrap what we have and be ""refounded"" rather than ""tinker around the edges while people are dying."" He insists that, despite the Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement and anti-discrimination laws, it is hopeless to expect the system to change: ""At every moment when a new America seems to be about to be born, the umbilical cord of White supremacy is wrapped around the baby’s neck, choking the life out of it.""     
      Facimile of the U.S. Constitution
       (Fotosearch/Getty Images) The curious aspect of such comments is that we are constantly being reborn as a people. Our Constitution created an experiment in self-governance that remains a work in progress. However, it does not guarantee that you simply get what you want or you can ""throw out"" the Constitution like Mystal's unwanted trash. The people of Ukraine have given the world a symbol of defiance and faith. That is a country that has been deeply divided in the past and only gained its independence in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly counted on many opting to stand aside rather than stand up for their young nation. Instead, opposing parties and leaders stood together and united in their common identity as Ukrainians. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It appears from this poll that many in the U.S. have lost that capacity for faith and sacrifice. Many are unwilling to take that same leap of faith in our system and each other. President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat who was decorated for his bravery in World War II, famously declared in 1961: ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.""

Anastasiia, a 22-year-old woman who spoke to Fox News Digital about her experiences surviving amid the Russia-Ukraine war in Irpin, expressed that she feels guilty for escaping Kyiv amid the attacks. ""I have this huge guilt that we left our home and I really feel like we should have stayed, but I know we couldn't have done much from there,"" Anastasiia said. ""So at this point, I just, you know, I just felt very, I guess, controversial because it really doesn't feel right to be here because it's kind of cold here.""

""And I just, I feel like all the people who are in eastern and central Ukraine right now, the things they're seeing, I don't think you can ever go back from that. So I just really feel a lot of guilt and hate and pain, all at the same time."" Anastasiia also spoke about the surrealness of hearing ""explosions outside of [her] window"" in Kyiv and escaping the city under attack to flee to Irpin. The 22-year-old also said she and her boyfriend initially believed while escaping that ""Russia is using some scare tactic"" to pressure the Ukrainian government ""into a more favorable negotiating position"" for the Kremlin.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   As Russia’s war machine grinds into the third week of its brutal invasion of Ukraine,  President Vladimir Putin  has launched a recruiting operation in the  Syrian  Arab Republic in an effort to attract reinforcements for his armed forces. Commentators believe the announcement is in part due to  Russia’s poor planning of the war , which has led to many Russian soldiers being killed.  Last week a U.S official told CBS News the number of Russian deaths could be between 5,000 and 6,000.  Putin and his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, recently declared that as many as 16,000 combatants from the  Middle East  will enter the  Ukrainian war on the side of Russia . The promised pay, according to news reports, is around $3,000 per month. US NEEDS TO STAND UP TO CHINA, WHO IS ‘ALL IN’ WITH RUSSIA: SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM ""It appears that Russia has opened 14 mercenary recruitment centers in Syria in territories controlled by the regime of Bashar al-Assad (Damascus, Aleppo, Hama, Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor),"" Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russian and Middle Eastern Affairs at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, told Fox News Digital. ""After a short training, the mercenaries will be transported to Russia through the Khmeimim Air Base by two Tu-134 (up to 80 passengers) and Tu-154 (up to 180 passengers) aircraft to the Chkalovsky Air Base, Moscow region.""  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Karasik added that ""We need to be aware that there is an information war ongoing regarding the recruitment of fighters by multiple parties to this conflict. There is some evidence that these fighters will enter into the battle space in greater numbers in the coming weeks."" The battle space, he continued, ""is being prepared for partisan warfare and taking lessons learned  from Grozny and Syria are going  to be important for all actors. Recruitment drives are robust and supported by state actors.""      
      Service members gather in a square during head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov's address, dedicated to a military conflict in Ukraine, in Grozny, Russia, Feb. 25, 2022. 
       (REUTERS/Chingis Kondarov) Grozny saw intensive urban warfare conducted by Russian forces during the initial stages of the First Chechen War in 1994-95 and the Second Chechen War in 1999-2000, with some military observers claiming they are now doing the same with Ukraine. Karasik said the recruiting effort is about applying Syrian fighters’ capacity in another theater because of the experience they acquired in the long civil war. ""I think it's a mixed picture because of the multiple groups [in Syria] and how they’ve split and come back together again,"" he said. ""So really, it’s about the quality of the recruits, and what we need to look at next is who are they really sending? Who is signing up for this? How do they guarantee the quality of the fighters?""  Brig. Gen. Ahmad Rahal, who resigned in protest from the Syrian military in 2012 over the policies of President Bashar Assad and joined the opposition Free Syria Army, told Fox News Digital that the Russians will use the Syrian and other mercenaries to carry out the ""dirty tasks"" of fighting in the cities, which will lead to more civilian deaths and it will help them avoid being blamed for the war crimes. ""The Russian army is besieging most of the Ukrainian cities, and now it is taking the appropriate fighting arrangement around the cities, and the next stage will be military operations by storming the cities, and these mercenaries coming from Syria from Assad’s army and Assad’s mercenaries will perform a large part of those tasks,"" Rahal said. He added, ""As a military observer, it is clear that the Russian army had to change its military plans. At first the Russians wanted a classic war, a war of armies, and the task assigned to the Russian army was a lightning and quick operation that President Putin called a ‘special operation’ through which the Ukrainian army would be crushed and then the leadership would collapse political in the capital Kyiv, but this did not happen.""   Video The brigadier general noted that, ""It is clear that the Ukrainian military leadership was a good reader of the military reality and the great difference between the capabilities of the Russian army and the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, so the Ukrainian leadership succeeded in dragging the Russian army into a war of resistance around cities, a guerrilla war, a war of ambushes, and later a street war if the Russian army stormed the Ukrainian cities."" Rahal said his information about the forces coming to fight in Ukraine included the following units: the 4th Division, commanded by Assad’s brother; the Syrian army’s special forces; the republican guard; the 25th division; the Russian backed 5th Corps; and ""the Palestinian Al-Quds Brigade, which is fighting with the Assad army (their nationalities are Palestinian and Syrian); and the National Defense Forces militias (Syrian mercenaries who have been fighting alongside the army since the start of the Syrian revolution in 2011)."" UKRAINE WAR: DO SANCTIONS WORK? EXPERTS WEIGH IN The Assad regime has been engulfed in war since 2011, when the Syrian dictator launched a violent crackdown on citizens seeking democracy. Russian forces intervened in 2015 to crush the revolt. The Syrian civil war has resulted in over 500,000 deaths. Retired Col. Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, told Fox News Digital, ""It’s not clear how many Syrians or other fighters from the Middle East are likely to answer Russia’s call. They will have to be paid significant amounts to volunteer to do so. There is no doubt that among them will be Islamic State jihadists who might be looking to stay in Russia or even travel on from there to Western Europe. They are likely to be disappointed if that is their aim, unless Putin is looking to help some of them infiltrate westwards.""

They are unlikely to be a match for well-armed and organized Ukrainian forces, but Putin will be happy to throw them away as cannon fodder."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rahal concluded with this warning: ""As a Syrian general, I refuse to push the Syrians into that war that Putin declared against the peaceful people of Ukraine. Putin wants to achieve political and personal goals at the expense of the Ukrainian people, and this is what Putin did before here in Syria.""  ",2022-03

   A group of 49 Republican senators on Monday said they will not support the Biden administration’s new nuclear deal with Iran, vowing to ""reverse"" any agreement that weakens sanctions and lessens restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear program. Every Republican senator except Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky signed on to a statement Monday directed to President Biden, Democrats and the international community, warning that a ""major agreement that does not have strong bipartisan support in Congress will not survive."" AGREEMENT TO RESTORE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL EXPECTED WITHIN DAYS: EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT ""According to press reports, the Biden administration may soon conclude an agreement with Iran to provide substantial sanctions relief in exchange for merely short-term limitations on Iran’s nuclear program,"" the Republican senators wrote. ""By every indication, the Biden administration appears to have given away the store,"" they continued, adding that the Biden administration ""appears to have agreed to lift sanctions that were not even placed on Iran for its nuclear activities in the first place, but instead because of its ongoing support for terrorism and its gross abuses of human rights.""   Video ""The nuclear limitations in this new deal appear to be significantly less restrictive than the 2015 nuclear deal, which was itself too weak, and will sharply undermine U.S. leverage to secure an actually ‘longer and stronger’ deal,"" they said. ""What is more, the deal appears likely to deepen Iran’s financial and security relationship with Moscow and Beijing, including through arms sales."" Republicans criticized the Biden administration for having ""refused to commit to submit a new Iran deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, as per its constitutional obligation, or for review under statutory requirements that passed on a bipartisan basis in response to the 2015 deal."" ""Additionally, despite earlier promises to the contrary, the administration has failed to adequately consult with Congress,"" they added. ""Republicans have made it clear: We would be willing and eager to support an Iran policy that completely blocks Iran’s path to a nuclear weapons capability, constrains Iran’s ballistic missile program, and confronts Iran’s support for terrorism,"" they said. ""But if the administration agrees to a deal that fails to achieve these objectives or makes achieving them more difficult, Republicans will do everything in our power to reverse it.""

""A major agreement that does not have strong bipartisan support in Congress will not survive."" However, questioning Republicans, an administration official asked ""specifically"" what ""they would do to prevent Iran from getting a nuke since a maximum pressure campaign did not work."" A senior Republican congressional aide close to the GOP push on the Iran deal told Fox News that the Iranian regime ""only started rushing toward a nuclear weapon after Biden was elected.""  ""Not even the Biden administration disputes that timeline, even though they hope no one notices,"" the aide said. ""Republicans want a return to the maximum pressure sanctions campaign, which sent Iran's economy into a death spiral, backed by a credible military threat in case they try to cross the finish line.""  The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) set limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for a significant rollback of international sanctions. The Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the deal amid concerns that the agreement did not do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions – including the sunset clauses on restrictions. Iran eventually pulled out of the deal after the Trump administration re-imposed sanctions as part of its maximum pressure campaign, and Tehran has been ramping up its enrichment since then. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said this week it believes Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but that it is unable to verify the exact size of the stockpile due to limits imposed on inspectors by the regime. The Biden administration has sought to re-enter the deal, and  talks began in Vienna  last year to revive it. Those talks initially stalled amid demands for significant sanctions relief by Iran’s hard-line regime.

   A growing number of Republican and Democratic lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to facilitate  a deal  with Poland to send MiG-29 planes to Ukraine for additional air support as Russia continues its multi-front war on the country. The Pentagon last week rejected Poland’s proposal for the U.S. and NATO to deliver  MiG-29 planes  to the Ukrainian military, arguing that the move could be mistaken as ""escalatory"" and could result in ""significant Russian reaction"" that could increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   On Monday, a group of 15 bipartisan House lawmakers penned a letter to President Biden, urging the administration to provide additional defense material to Ukraine and strengthen economic sanctions directed at Russia. ""Despite heroic and skillful resistance by Ukrainian forces, Russia currently retains air superiority over Ukraine,"" they wrote. ""Russia’s advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid."" The lawmakers called for stinger missiles, saying they believe they will ""continue to be critical in combating Russia’s superiority in the air."" ""The U.S. must also help to supply more comprehensive air defense systems to defend Ukraine and its people,"" they wrote, adding that the U.S. should coordinate with NATO allies who possess S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to ""facilitate and expedite the transfer of these systems into Ukraine.""

""We also believe that the U.S. should seriously consider strategies to provide further drone capability to the Ukrainians, as they have already used Bayraktar TB2 drones with success on the battlefield,"" they added.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: PARLIAMENT OF NATO COUNTRY ESTONIA CALLS FOR 'IMMEDIATE' ESTABLISHMENT OF NO-FLY ZONE The lawmakers also called for strengthening economic sanctions — specifically against ""third parties that do business with Russian entities and individuals."" ""If necessary, secondary sanctions should be levied against Chinese banks and businesses that do business with Russia, in order to best ensure that Russia is unable to find a means of offsetting its exclusion from U.S. and European markets and banking systems,"" they wrote.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so it is not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked, all member countries will take action to assist.

   Hello. We're back. Lots of news went on while we were apart.  Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian are still together. It's the couple that makes me ask: Would World War III be such a bad thing?  But we've been off for a few weeks and for good reason. This is a news channel. And war is news.  Actually, it's breaking news, and it's breaking all the time. But you can't spell breaking news without a break. And sometimes we do need a break.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES But first, let's assess what we know. KAMALA HARRIS: So Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically, that's wrong. You know, I love how she speaks to me, like I have a head injury. Maybe I do.  But it's true.  Russia  invaded  Ukraine . And like Joe Biden reading a children's book, what assumed would take days is now nearly a month.  And with every passing day, things just get more desperate.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Right now, the  Ukrainian people  are locked in a desperate struggle against Russian invaders. Their courage in the face of Russia’s brutal onslaught stands in stark contrast to the weakness in the White House. While  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  has rallied his people to defend their homeland, President Biden has responded with timidity and half-measures.   Video Most recently,  Biden rejected a plan  to deliver Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The Ukrainians are in dire need of aircraft and spare parts to prevent Russia from gaining air supremacy, but the president refused to give the Ukrainians these valuable tools when they were practically handed to him by one of our strongest allies, Poland. WEAKENING PUTIN REQUIRES TARGETING RUSSIA'S OIL AND BOOSTING US ENERGY PRODUCTION The Poles have a long and proud tradition of killing Russian invaders. They understand that helping Ukraine in its hour of need will make future Russian aggression less likely. As a result, they offered to transfer their entire fleet of MiG-29 fighters to U.S. forces for delivery to Ukraine.   Video The Biden administration’s response to the Polish offer was chaotic and confused. Secretary of State Antony Blinken initially gave Poland the ""green light"" to give fighters to Ukraine. But then, Biden balked. He scuttled the deal and sent his flacks running to the press to claim Poland’s plan was a complete surprise. Instead of presenting a united front with Poland, the Biden administration telegraphed indecision and incompetence. Biden’s defenders claim that sending MiGs to Ukraine would have ""provoked"" Putin and ""escalated"" America’s involvement in the war. But the United States shouldn’t be cowed by hollow threats from Moscow.  Biden’s fighter fiasco is only the latest example of his timidity in the face of Russian aggression.    Russia is bogged down in a war that’s far more costly than it predicted. The past two weeks of fighting have demonstrated the flaws of Russia’s armed forces as well as the tenacity of its enemies. If Putin attacked us or a NATO ally over a few dozen fighter jets, he would be signing up his military for a vastly larger and more painful struggle that he cannot afford to fight. He would be signing the death warrant of his corrupt regime, as well.

       (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Fighter jets are also no more provocative than the weapons America is already sending to Ukraine by the hundreds. We’ve already sent Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine that are turning Russian tanks and other armored vehicles into burning heaps of junk. We’ve also sent Stinger anti-air missiles that are blowing Russian helicopters and low-flying jets out of the sky.    Video Giving the Ukrainians more fighters won’t drag America into war; it will just make Ukraine more likely to win the war by keeping its air force in the fight. Biden’s fighter fiasco is only the latest example of his timidity in the face of Russian aggression.  When Russia built up its forces at the Ukrainian border, Biden rewarded Putin with a glitzy summit that increased his stature while gaining no concessions. On the eve of war, he admitted that a ""limited incursion"" into Ukraine might divide NATO and go unpunished. Once Putin invaded, Biden had to be dragged into sanctioning Russian oil and gas.    Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When Putin made nuclear threats, Biden caved by canceling a routine missile test, even though the U.S. notified the Russians about the test months ago. He has even refused to give the Ukrainians real-time intelligence about the Russian invasion force, again out of misplaced fear of ""escalation."" But if information is too provocative to send, what can we send? The United States must ensure that Russia pays a steep price for starting the biggest war in Europe since 1945. That means we must stand with the people of Ukraine – and arm every last one of them.   Video If Vladimir Putin and his oligarch allies don’t pay, they could widen the war and invade other countries, including NATO allies that we’re obligated to defend. Moreover, other tyrants may conclude that they can take territory by force and get away with it.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Communists in Beijing are watching Russia’s invasion with great interest. The fighting that began on the plains of Eastern Europe may end on the beaches of Taiwan. At every step, Joe Biden has allowed America’s response to be dictated from Moscow out of a fanciful fear of provocation. The wages of Biden’s weakness are Russian tanks rolling through Eastern Europe. If we fail to support Ukraine, the stakes and the flames of war will rise. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Russia’s act of total  war on the Ukrainian people  should have been a clear wake-up call for President Biden. Instead, he has mistakenly viewed this crisis as an opportunity to double down on reckless policies that cede American energy independence and transform the national security landscape for the worse.  President Biden’s announcement  of a U.S. ban on Russian energy imports is a good first step, but it is, unfortunately, more symbolic than punitive. And despite what Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., wishes us to believe, it is not ""American fossil fuel companies"" that have ""helped fuel Putin’s despicable war,"" it is the energy policies of President Biden.    Video On day one, the Biden administration signaled to the world that American energy leadership was approaching a turning point. His administration revoked permitting for the  Keystone XL pipeline , paused new leases on federal lands, and began to issue a flurry of executive orders and policy directives that suffocate new production. STOP BIDEN'S WAR ON OIL, GAS – FIGHT PUTIN BY MAKING US, EUROPE ENERGY INDEPENDENT The result has been a regulatory framework that creates supply bottlenecks, strains industry access to capital, and promotes the politicization of American energy security. Simply put, economic disaster and American inflexibility on the world stage.    Video The consequences of Biden’s lead-from-behind approach are clear. Americans now face an economic crisis not seen in forty years as inflation continues to mount, now reaching 7.9%. Oil prices continue their volatility well above the $100 mark.  For those wondering how vital American energy is to our economic well-being, we should note that one-quarter of inflationary growth this past year is the result of gasoline prices.  Instead of unleashing the benefits of our vast resources and pausing his aggressive pursuit of climate policy at all cost, Biden has preferred to court the resources of authoritarian rogue states like Iran and Venezuela.  Biden must finally fess up to his mistakes in the energy sector and roll back his policies stifling American energy security.   The Biden administration is paralyzed by ineptitude, and out over its skis when it comes to understanding energy market complexities. Despite what the progressive pundits want us to believe, it is not the American people, but the far-removed bureaucrats in Biden’s administration that are failing to understand the current crisis.  Biden’s recklessness now has American diplomats flirting with yet more sanction waivers for our adversaries, a move that would offer billions in annual revenue to Iran and Venezuela instead of the American people.  Make no mistake, these sanctioned nations have not cleaned up their act, far from it. The only difference is that President Biden has painted himself into a corner.    Video Venezuela, a prolific human rights abuser, and authoritarian regime bent on undermining U.S. interests, has long had economic ties with other U.S. adversaries, such as China and Iran. Most notably President Nicolas Maduro’s regime is propped up by its oil-for-loans program with the Chinese Communist Party and engages in illicit trade with Iran’s energy sector.  Iran, an even more notorious human rights abuser and state sponsor of terrorism, is likely to be the latest recipient of President Biden’s goodwill tour. As a part of rushed efforts to secure an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear ambitions, currently negotiated with the likes of China and Russia, sanctions on energy exports are likely to be lifted.    Video Is this what a ""foreign policy for the middle class"" looks like? The Biden administration should be pursuing policies that empower American workers, and prioritize American families, not the pockets of nefarious dictators like Ayatollah Khamenei or President Maduro. President Biden must finally fess up to his mistakes in the energy sector and roll back his policies stifling American energy security. Unfortunately, even if Biden were to experience a revelation of truth, his past blunders have locked in higher-than-usual prices for the near term.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER However, the Biden administration can act now to ensure this crisis does not continue to grow. This means halting the regulatory assault on energy financing, development and production and restarting federal leases for new oil and gas development.

       (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Press secretary Jen Psaki’s repeated claims of 9,000 unused federal leases ignore the implications of an administration that undermines industry efforts through regulatory hurdles. The actions of the Biden administration offer only uncertainty, particularly for financial backers of resource development.  His administration must also act to jumpstart energy infrastructure projects. President Biden has the tools to reauthorize the Keystone XL pipeline, which is not simply a ""delivery mechanism,"" but rather thousands of jobs and 830,000 barrels of oil a day that our refineries need. The same goes for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which now faces a new volley of environmental challenges.

These actions will send the signal that American energy leadership is back.  We shouldn’t be rewarding Russia when it continues to act as a rogue state, and we shouldn’t pursue policies that hurt American consumers in the short term. And we shouldn’t have Washington running to places like Venezuela looking for a helping hand.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   The Middle East has taken  center stage  this week as oil prices continue to skyrocket and western nations look to boycott Moscow over its  deadly invasion  into Ukraine. But the Biden administration’s attempts to garner support from  oil-rich nations  to assist Ukraine and counter prices at the pump has been met with resistance, the result of what some argue is long-standing mistrust of the U.S. from nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to recent reports, President Biden was  rebuffed  by the two nations' leaders when he attempted to arrange calls with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The White House National Security Council (NSC) pushed back hard on the reports, with spokesperson Emily Horne telling Fox News, ""This is a mischaracterization and does not reflect reality. There are no rebuffed calls, period."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES In addition, Secretary of State  Antony Blinken  last week downplayed the suggestion that the Biden administration was snubbed by oil-leading nations in the Middle East saying, ""We're all talking regularly."" However, the complex relationship between the U.S. and the oil-rich Gulf nations dates back decades and has been influenced by geopolitical policies relating to everything from oil embargoes in the 1970s to the suspension of arms amid the ongoing crisis in Yemen.

       (Saudi Royal Court via AP) ""In the Middle East, and specifically in Arab society, relationships matter. The last thing you want to be is a fair-weather friend,"" Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official who advised the military on matters relating to Iran and Iraq under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News Digital. ""And from the very start, [Team] Biden defined themselves as a fair-weather friend."" Upon entering office, President Biden vowed to not only end the war in Yemen, which has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world with hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced, but said he would stop supplying arms to Saudi Arabia.  The war in Yemen kicked off in 2014 when Shia Houthi rebels backed by Iran attempted to overthrow the government. By 2015, under Barack Obama, the U.S. began arming Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have backed the Yemeni government. But mass causalities and the humanitarian crisis prompted the U.S. to  limit its military support  to the Saudi campaign in 2016. IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS SCREECH TO A HALT AMID NEW RUSSIAN DEMANDS This decision was reversed in 2017 under the Trump administration, and U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia increased by more than 40%, according to the  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  arms transfer  database .  Biden's administration  largely reflects  that of the Obama White House to include Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and NSC Adviser Jake Sullivan. The president has also said he would revert to policies held by the previous Democratic administration.  The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the nature of the former Obama administration and current Biden administration officials' relationships with the oil-rich Middle Eastern country leaders.

""And to underscore our commitment, we're ending all American support for offensive operations in the war on Yemen, including relevant arms sales."" Biden later frustrated members of his own party with a November decision to sell $650 million in defensive aid to the Saudi government as it continues to get pummeled by Houthi forces.  The administration justified its move by saying it will continue to prioritize human rights while working with important partners in the region. But some foreign policy experts have argued that the tumultuous U.S. relationship with the Gulf states is rooted in decisions made during the Obama administration when then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice prioritized human rights over geopolitical ties. BLINKEN DOWNPLAYS REPORTS OF SAUDI, UAE DISTRUST OF BIDEN ADMIN ""There's an element of where there's smoke there's fire,"" Rubin told Fox News Digital. ""The Saudis wouldn't be the first to complain about Susan Rice."" Rubin argued that while several of Rice’s decisions in the Middle East put a bad taste in the mouth of Gulf nations, ""I don't think it can be nailed to just one person."" ""You've got a situation where progressives may want to apply pressure to Abu Dhabi and Riyadh because of human rights violations, but they really need to take a step back and consider whether we would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater,"" Rubin added. ""Because if we force the Saudis and the Emirates into the arms of Beijing, it's going to be a lot harder advocating for human rights than it is now."" BARR WARNS CHINA IS 'BIGGEST THREAT' TO US, WARNS OF 'HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE' TECH PLAN China’s grip  in the Middle East has increased in recent years as relations with the West have strained.  Though some relations were improved under the Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and Muslim nations like Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco and Sudan, Beijing’s influence in the region remained.  ""This is a systematic problem in Washington. We tend to conceive of our relations as always bilateral,"" said Rubin, who is also a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute. ""But we're not the only players in the sandbox.""

GOP SENATORS SLAM BIDEN FOR WORKING WITH RUSSIA ON IRAN DEAL DURING UKRAINE INVASION: 'INSANE' Saudi Arabia backed the U.S. war in Afghanistan after 9/11 and later during the Iraq war, but Rubin argued that there was a level of disregard toward Saudi concerns during the George W. Bush administration. ""The Saudis were afraid for sectarian reasons that we were going [to] … basically open Pandora's box and, to some extent, they were right,"" Rubin said. ""At the same time, under Obama, the Saudis believe that we were not taking seriously their concerns vis-a-vis Iran. And remember today that they're getting hit by Iranian drones that are being flown from Iraq, are being flown from Yemen."" U.S. relations with Iran have also drastically affected U.S. ties with other top players in the region.

   For years, world leaders have accused  Russia of funding environmental groups  in Europe to steer nations away from energy independence and strengthen Russia’s iron grip over the continent. As nations across the globe begin shunning Russian oil in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. leaders are also questioning how deep Russia’s ties go in the environmental community.  ""The Russians actually fund some of the most rabid environmental groups in Europe because they sic them on the energy projects that aren’t  Russian ,"" James Carafano, vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in a recent phone interview.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Back in June 2014, just months after Russia annexed the  Crimean Peninsula  from Ukraine,  European leaders sounded off that Russia  was using disinformation operations with environmental groups to steer countries away from fracking in favor of Russian oil.

In general, the potential for Russia using energy supplies as a means of putting pressure on European nations is a matter of concern. No country should use supply and pricing terms as tools of coercion,"" the NATO official told the Guardian in 2014.  Environmental groups have meanwhile feverishly denied any ties to Russia.  ""The idea we’re puppets of Putin is so preposterous that you have to wonder what they’re smoking over at NATO HQ,"" Greenpeace told the Guardian in 2014.

The journalist, whose name was not initially reported, cited the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, a term pushed by Russian President  Vladimir Putin  as an attempt to justify the invasion to the Russian populous by claiming troops must liberate the Ukrainian people from the Ukrainian government run by neo-Nazis.  ""I would restore the death penalty by hanging through military tribunal,"" the pundit, speaking Russian, said, according to a translated quote by Newsweek. ""There are people in Ukraine who threaten Russian citizens and create a threat for us. … In my view, this is of utmost importance.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   As Ukraine continues to resist  Russia's  invasion, citizens across the country describe themselves as more united than ever and eager to help in any way they can, including in what one Ukrainian named Lily calls the ""digital war."" Her group, called "" Dattalion "" and led by some of Ukraine's top professional women, isn't shooting down planes but rather is fighting a different kind of battle by documenting the bloody war, day by day.  One of the Dattalion's leaders, going by ""Mariya"" instead of her real name for security purposes, told Fox News Digital the mission is simple: Tell the world the truth about what's happening in Ukraine through the power of images. ""Basically we are fighting against Russia with data, with information, and we want to show to the world about what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine, what they are doing to our kids, what they are doing to our elderly, what they are doing to our homes,"" Mariya said. ""It is a database primarily of videos but also of photos taken by civilian Ukrainians, ordinary people with their smartphones."" UKRAINIAN JOURNALIST GROUP WORKS TO INFORM WORLD MEDIA, GET MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO RESIST RUSSIANS The Dattalion, a combination of the words ""Data Battalion,"" was founded on Feb. 27, just three days after Russia launched its invasion, and it has thus far uploaded more than 1,000 videos and photos to  its database  from ordinary citizens. Updated several times per day, it's organized by day and region and provides the date and locations of the videos and images sent to them of the war, such as the  maternity hospital  bombed in Mariupol last week,  bloodied civilians  dazed from Russian shelling, and children being rescued and evacuated. The team has regional groups who work to verify footage as authentic.

       (REUTERS/Vitalii Hnidyi) Lily, who recently returned to Ukraine from Poland after driving a truck full of humanitarian supplies back across the border, said Russia was trying to ""fool all the world"" with its propaganda machine, which has blamed ""neo-Nazis"" for the violence and claimed Ukraine was responsible for a recent Russian shelling attack on Kharkiv that killed dozens of civilians. ""It is very important,"" Lily said of the Dattalion's work. ""All the information that comes from Russia, it's all fake … They are trying to fool all the world, and they've already done it with their people. That's why we want to spread truth to the world, and video and information is our weapon actually, and video and posts, marketing campaigns is our tools, so this is what we know how to do."" Given it was formed mere days after the invasion began last month, Lily said it had quickly become a cohesive organization. It has more than 100 volunteers and is growing by the day. It has an active social media presence and encourages journalists, politicians and others around the world to access its files. Meanwhile, the Dattalion's members have coped with hacking attacks and personal threats, in addition to the immense stress of seeing their country invaded and fearing the deaths of loved ones. STATE DEPT SAYS IT IS REVIEWING ‘VERY CREDIBLE’ REPORTS OF RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES IN UKRAINE ""We never sought this, but when we looked at our volunteers, why our volunteers are so passionate about this project because every day they are losing something, and they want to show to the world the horrors,"" Mariya said. Lily said she often cries before editing the footage she reviews. Mariya grew emotional as she recounted the war's effect on her own family. As of Friday, the  United Nation’s office of Human Rights said  it has recorded 42 children dead among the 579 civilians killed, with 54 more children wounded among the 1,002 civilians injured. RUSSIA-UKRAINE LIVE UPDATES ""I've never ever in my life imagined me or my family or anyone would go through this,"" she said. ""I could never ever imagine my kids would hear some loud sounds and would shake.""

       The cataloguing effort is their way of contributing and ensuring Ukraine's crisis is crystal-clear to the rest of the globe. From data collection to input to video editing to communications, there are a variety of roles for the Dattalion's members, many of whom before the invasion held business and other leadership positions inside Ukraine. Another member, going by ""Marina"" and currently in Austria, said she felt ""guilty"" about not being back in Ukraine, but she was gladdened by the sense of national unity in the wake of the invasion. ""You want to help your country,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I believe that never, ever in the history of Ukraine, we never felt so united, we never felt so in love with a country … [If] you had bad relationship with a [fellow Ukrainian], it's all in the past. You're just united to do something to help. ""The only weapon that we have is our MacBook or the internet and our smartphones. This is how we fight, how we help the world to tell the truth. It's painful. It's painful to see what's going on. You cannot just stand by, and you cannot right now only think about yourself. It's the place where we want to live, and everyone is trying to bring even a small piece. What we are doing at Dattalion, it's not a small piece. It's a huge piece."" Multiple members told Fox News Digital they wanted the U.S. and NATO allies to ""close the skies,"" the term Ukrainians use for implementing a  no-fly zone  over Ukraine's airspace. The U.S. has been hesitant to take that step thus far, as shooting down a Russian plane could spark a hot war ensnaring the world's nuclear powers. ‘THE VIEW’ CLASHES OVER PROPOSED UKRAINE NO-FLY ZONE: ‘WE DON’T WANT WORLD WAR III' ""We will fight to the end, but we need some help, and the best thing the world should do is close the sky,"" Mariya said.

       (REUTERS/Oleksandr Lapshyn) The Dattalion site features a counting clock for how long the war has gone on since Russia's invasion last month, but the ""digital war"" could go on past the end of the kinetic part of the conflict. Beyond continuing to keep the world informed of the conditions on the ground in some of Ukraine's bombed-out cities and towns, the database could also be a tool in the future of proving war crimes and atrocities by Russian forces, members say. ""The fact is that we've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would, under the Geneva Conventions, constitute a war crime,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said last week. Price’s comment came after several widely reported instances of Russian troops appearing to commit war crimes, including  bombing  the maternity ward, which the Kremlin has denied, and  killing  fleeing civilians. As more of the footage comes in from Kyiv, Irpin, Kharkiv and elsewhere in the war-torn nation, the Dattalion will continue its difficult work.

   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is making clear who it thinks is responsible for the record-high gas prices plaguing Americans, and it isn't  President Biden . In an editorial on Monday, the paper placed blame squarely on Russia, citing its  ongoing invasion of Ukraine , and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the fluctuating demand for oil as the reasons for gas prices reaching a record average of $4.33 last week.  The editorial board also accused Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as well as other Republicans, of lying about the root causes of  more expensive gas , and claimed they were placing their own self-interest ""above America’s interest in defending democracy in Ukraine."" BLAMING GAS PRICES ON BIDEN IS ‘FRANKLY UN-AMERICAN,’ DEMOCRAT REP. SAYS ""After publicly pressuring President Joe Biden to halt Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine, it took Sen. Josh Hawley literally just hours to lambast the president for doing exactly that last week and for being honest with the American people about the effect it would have on gas prices,"" the board wrote.  ""Would Hawley have preferred that Biden lie — the way Hawley and his Republican colleagues have been lying for months about the root causes of more expensive gasoline?"" it added. ""As predictable as this chorus of partisan heckling always was, it’s still disappointing that, even now, Hawley and his cohorts can’t help but put their own self-serving demagoguery above America’s interest in defending democracy in Ukraine.""   The paper admitted ""the pain"" facing Americans at the gas pump is real, but claimed that Republicans have been  spinning myths  around the causes by blaming Biden's environmental policies.  The Post-Dispatch specifically noted one of Republican critics' key components: Biden's cancellation of the  Keystone XL pipeline . It, however, justified the cancellation by arguing the  pipeline  wouldn't have had any impact on current prices because completion wasn't expected until next year.  The board argued the same about Biden's ""failed attempt"" to  suspend any new oil and gas leases  on federal land.

The editorial went on to argue that gas prices plummeted during the onset of the pandemic because of low demand, which in turn led to decreased oil production, but that demand has surged following society's reopening, making it hard for production to keep up, thus increasing prices.  It added that the  ban on Russian oil imports  as a result of the country's actions in Ukraine has caused the price to go up even more.  ""It’s an unfortunate fact of politics that repeating a lie enough can often entrench it in a debate — especially when an entire political party is repeating it in lockstep,"" the board wrote.  ""As this year’s midterms approach, voters who are still open to facts should ask themselves what it says about any candidate who must resort to such a strategy,"" it added in an apparent swipe at Republican candidates.

MIKE GALLAGHER:  Zelenskyy can go a long way towards inspiring the West to continue to provide lethal assistance, and this is going to get more difficult as the Russians escalate. They've reportedly started attacking supply lines near the Polish border, and that's why we can't flinch. We can't back down in the face of Russian pressure. And so I would like Zelenskyy to lay out exactly what he needs. Talk in particular about the role that those Polish MiG 29s could have played in allowing him to stand up to Russia.  The other thing I'd like him to address, and I don't know if he'll go there, is the role that China is playing in all of this in supporting Russia's slaughter in Ukraine. The Biden administration needs to stop playing footsie with the Chinese right now because they're trying to portray themselves as peacemakers. But behind the scenes, they're standing by their man in Moscow. And the harder this gets for Putin, the more dependent he's going to become on China, both as a destination for weapons supplies as well as energy sales. And so, we need to call out the role the Chinese are playing here. This alliance among authoritarian states is a feature of the new Cold War that China has launched against America. The sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can win the new Cold War. WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:   Video  ",2022-03

He agreed. On March 6th, the secretary of state said that we would greenlight a transfer of MiGs, Polish MiGs into Ukraine. We were OK with that. A few days later, when Poland asked us to be part of the transfer, we folded like a cheap suit. What I think happened is that the Russians told Biden and his team that if you send these MiGs in, that will be an escalation and they were intimidated by Putin. We can't let Putin determine who's in NATO. We can't let Putin determine what we do to help the Ukraine.

Security Council – a move that would elude Russia’s veto power. It is unclear what will be included in the France-Mexico resolution, but it is expected to meet the 50% threshold needed to pass through the General Assembly. Russia is expected to vote against the resolution, particularly if there is any language that condemns the deadly incursion into Ukraine following its rejection of a non-binding General Assembly resolution  earlier this month  that demanded Putin withdraw all forces.  Nebenzia said Russia will introduce its own ""humanitarian"" resolution in the U.N.

Ukraine's parliament is expected to vote on the measure this week. The Ukrainian leader appealed for more weapons to counter Russia’s military. He said Ukraine's forces are rapidly using up weapons and other hardware supplied by Western nations, and he asked northern European leaders to ""help yourself by helping us."" This comes before a 35-hour curfew is to go into effect in Kyiv on Tuesday evening.  When Russia launched the war three weeks ago, fear of an imminent invasion gripped the Ukrainian capital, and residents slept in subway stations or crammed onto trains to flee the city. But as the Russian offensive became bogged down, Kyiv saw a relative lull. U.S. officials say Russian forces were about 9 miles from the center of the city as of Monday, according to The Associated Press.  But large explosions thundered across Kyiv before dawn Tuesday from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes. Zelenskyy said barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and caused dozens of deaths.  The early morning shelling hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin, which has seen some of the worst battles of the war. Flames shot out of the 15-story apartment building and smoke choked the air as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. The assault blackened several floors of the building, ripped a hole in the ground outside and blew out windows in neighboring apartment blocks. In a message posted to Telegram, Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the curfew takes effect at 8 p.m. Tuesday and ends at 7 am. Thursday. Announcing military command’s decision, he warned that movement throughout the city without special passes was prohibited unless people are headed to bomb shelters. ""Today is a difficult and dangerous moment,"" he said.  He said civilians should prepare not to leave home for two days, unless sirens warning of air raids go off. Then, in that case, residents should be prepared not to leave shelters during that time-period.  ""The capital - the heart of Ukraine - will be defended!"" Klitschko added. ""And Kyiv, which today is a symbol and outpost of European freedom and security, we will not give up! We will not be brought to our knees!

Ukrainians have shown the world their courage and willingness to fight for their land. Only together we will survive! Glory to Ukraine!""  The U.N. has described the flood of people crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries as Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II. The International Organization for Migration revealed on Tuesday that more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, according to The Associated Press.  Russian and Ukrainian negotiators also planned to hold a second day of talks as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reached its 20th day. The Ukrainian government said new aid and evacuation efforts would take place Tuesday along nine corridors around the country, including the Kyiv region. But past evacuation attempts have repeatedly failed amid continued fighting. The International Committee of the Red Cross said an evacuation involving 30 buses was planned from Sumy in northeast Ukraine. The organization said it still had not gotten aid to Mariupol, an encircled port city of 430,000 where local officials estimate a lethal siege has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Russian-state media outlet RIA Novosti also shared edited footage from the ISS that appears to show the cosmonauts waving goodbye to Vande Hei and departing without him before the Russian segment detaches from the rest of the space station.  ""It kind of enraged me that the country that we had been in this international partnership for 20 years would take the time to make a video to threaten to leave behind one of the crew members they are responsible for,"" Kelly told the Wall Street Journal this week.  ""They agreed to be responsible for his safety, getting him to the space station and getting him home. For me, that kind of just crossed the line.""

   China  asserted Tuesday that it was completely ""impartial"" over the conflict in  Ukraine  and dismissed so-called ""disinformation"" from the U.S. government, suggesting that China agreed to send military equipment to Russian troops.  China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian – who hasn’t openly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching an invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago and has called the conflict the ""Ukraine issue"" instead of war – made the remarks to reporters during his daily press conference.  ""China’s position and statement on the Ukraine issue is completely objective, impartial and constructive,"" Zhao said, according to a translation by The Associated Press. ""We have a clear goal, that is to promote the de-escalation of the situation and end the conflict as soon as possible."" KYIV TO WELCOME 3 EUROPEAN PRIME MINISTERS BEFORE 35-HOUR CURFEW TAKES EFFECT: LIVE UPDATES  According to the transcript of his remarks shared to the Chinese foreign affairs website, Zhao said, ""China’s position and statement on the Ukraine issue is completely objective, just and constructive. We have a clear goal, that is, to deescalate the situation and put an end to the conflict as soon as possible. We believe China’s position will receive understanding and support from more and more countries.""  Though the two translations differed slightly, the message was the same. Zhao criticized the U.S. by nodding to China's contention that Russia was provoked by NATO's expansion and threats to its security. ""What the U.S. should do is to deeply reflect on the role it has played in the development and evolving of the Ukraine crisis, and do something practical to ease the tension in Ukraine,"" he said.  Zhao's comments came a day after U.S. adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome over the Biden administration's increasingly concerns that China is using the Ukraine war to advance Beijing’s long-term interest in its competition with the United States.

       ((Jin Mamengni/Xinhua via AP)) Speaking to CNN Monday, before the seven-hour face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Sullivan said the U.S. is ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them."" The Kremlin has denied reports it requested Chinese military equipment for use in the war. Zhao on Tuesday said China opposed the use of sanctions from the West, currently pummeling the Russia economy. He again dismissed reports that China agreed to send aid to Russia as ""disinformation.""  He also said a third batch of humanitarian aid sent by China for Ukraine arrived in Poland on Monday. ""China is committed to facilitating dialogue for peace, and believes that the international community should jointly support the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine for early substantive outcomes, so as to deescalate the situation as soon as possible,"" Zhao said. ""All parties should exercise maximum restraint, protect civilians and prevent a massive humanitarian crisis. China has provided emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and will continue to make its efforts to that end. China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread disinformation and distort and smear China’s position.""

China’s relationship with Taiwan has  come into focus  against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the island bolstering its own defenses since the war started in case of aggression from the mainland.  Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile-production capacity this year.

But cutting off one of those supply links brought a ""depressing feeling"" to Andrey Bibik, head of the Interpipe steel plant in Dnipro, Ukraine.

       (Eugene Sabadyr/Interpipe Steel via AP) Similar production halts have spread across other industries in Ukraine, motivated not just by safety concerns but also because the war and mass exodus of refugees have closed off roads and railways to commercial freight traffic. Some of Interpipe’s finished products bound for overseas export are now stalled at the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine accounts for only about 0.3% of the world’s exports, while Russia’s share is about 1.9%, according to a report by the Dutch bank ING. Still, some industries doing business with these nations are starting to feel the war’s impact. BIDEN BLAMING HIGH GAS PRICES ON RUSSIA IS CYNICAL AND DISGRACEFUL For Russia, a key producer of energy, steel and raw metals such as nickel, copper, platinum and palladium — many of which are important to the auto industry — the supply concerns are tied to  punishing Western economic sanctions  and Russia’s moves to retaliate against them. For Ukraine, the war itself is cutting off supplies. ""We want to give priority to the refugees, people trying to move out of the war zone, and humanitarian and military convoys,"" said Interpipe’s Houston-based chairman and former CEO Fadi Hraibi. The disruption of another Ukrainian industry — the making of wiring harnesses used in cars — is already hurting European automakers. Ukraine has more than 30 automotive plants, most of them centered near the western border with Poland and other European neighbors, according to a government agency that promotes foreign investment.

       (Eugene Sabadyr/Interpipe Steel via AP) German parts supplier Leoni said production has been interrupted at its two western Ukraine plants in Styri and Kolomyja and that it’s looking for temporary alternatives. ""We are aware that this situation is currently affecting not only Leoni, but the entire industry,"" said spokesperson Gregor le Claire. Ukraine is also among the world’s largest suppliers of neon, a gas used in lasers that help etch integrated circuits onto computer chips. That worries auto industry executives, who fear that tight neon supplies could  worsen a global chip shortage  that has already forced production cuts and made vehicles scarce worldwide. Interpipe has five factories in Ukraine, all located in the industrial hub of Dnipro and its surrounding oblast, or region, which holds a strategic position on the Dnieper River southeast of the capital, Kyiv. RUSSIA DUPED EUROPE INTO ENERGY DEPENDENCE BY FUNDING 'RABID ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS': EXPERTS Until  Russian airstrikes began targeting Dnipro  on Friday, the country’s fourth-largest city had been mostly quiet — except for occasional air raid sirens — in the two weeks since Russia invaded the country. But executives at Interpipe made a quick decision on Feb. 24 to shut down all of its facilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion before dawn and by lunchtime, plant operations were wound down, Bibik said. That evening, he watched the last five workers get shuttled off to the suburb where they live. All of Interpipe’s workers are still being paid, Bibik and Hraibi said.

       (Eugene Sabadyr/Interpipe Steel via AP) Interpipe’s customers in the energy and rail industries typically order their pipes, wheels and other products months in advance, but Hraibi said the disruptions will cause shortages and lead some to look for alternatives. For some wheel customers, such a Saudi Arabian railway operator, Interpipe is the sole supplier, he said. Two of the company’s chief steel industry rivals,  OMK and Evraz , are in Russia and he hopes customers will avoid them.

But in reality, nobody can predict what’s going to happen.""  ",2022-03

As well as the Antarctic,"" he said. ""We discovered it, so it belongs to us."" The sale of Alaska marked the end of the Russian Empire's trade expansion and settlement efforts to the Pacific coast of the U.S., according to the State Department. The territory was sold to the U.S. government for $7.2 million.  Opponents of the sale labeled it ""Seward’s Folly,"" referring then-Secretary of State William H.

After several years of struggling to grow crops and tensions with Americans in the area, the property was sold in 1841 after it became clear the area was a financial liability, according to the Fort Ross Conservancy.  The demands made by Matveychev are likely to be ignored as the U.S. ratchets up sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, the State Department announced fresh sanctions on President Alexander Lukashenko, the Kremlin's ally in Belarus, and 11 other Russian officials.  On Tuesday, Moscow imposed retaliatory sanctions against  President Biden  and administration officials.

   Pope Francis  announced Tuesday that he will consecrate Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, fulfilling a 1917 vision purportedly revealed to Portuguese children that such a blessing would usher in a period of world peace. The consecration will take place on March 25 and will be done at Saint Peter's Basilica. The blessing will coincide with the Feast of the Annunciation of the Lord, a Catholic feast day.

HUNDREDS OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY URGE TO ‘STOP THE WAR’ IN UKRAINE On July 13, 1917, the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to a group of shepherds in Fatima, Portugal, to whom she gave three secrets to be revealed to the world. The trio, a group of child shepherds, claimed to have been visited six times by the Virgin Mary. The children described three visions they say were given to them – one of hell, one of the end to World War I, and a final vision of an unnamed pope being killed by gunfire, as well as angels sprinkling blood of Christian martyrs on the deceased. However, a clause of the second vision has remained under scrutiny – a request to consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The apparition allegedly told the children that a consecration of Russia would stop the nation's ""errors throughout the world, promoting wars and persecution of the Church.""  If the consecration did not happen, the apparition claimed ""the good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have much to suffer, various nations will be destroyed."" Catholics have debated for decades both the validity of the Our Lady of Fatima apparitions and whether this specific consecration was performed. Pope Pius XII consecrated the entire world in 1942, and followed it with a similar blessing in 1952, this time for ""all the peoples of Russia."" In 1964, then-pope Paul VI renewed the Russian consecration during the Second Vatican Council. Pope John Paul II also composed a prayer of ""entrustment"" for Russia in 1981.

   A veteran Ukrainian journalist gave a glimpse into the day-to-day operation of managing a news team dispersed by a pandemic and  now an invasion . Director General of the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency of News Misha Gannytskyi, speaking from Zhytomyr, told Fox News Digital it took him eight hours to drive there from the Ukraine capital just 75 miles away.

   Chuck DeVore, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, tells 'The Ben Domenech Podcast' what the United States can do to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia beyond a no-fly zone. CHUCK DEVORE:  Ukraine isn't a small place. Excluding Crimea, it's just a little smaller than Texas. It's got about 46 million people. It's got 7 million people who are fit for military service. They are daily rallying to the flag and being issued automatic weapons. So it's going to be very, very difficult for Russia to achieve its political objective, which was to change the regime in Kyiv and put in a friendly puppet government. And so because of that, then what we're likely going to see is continued destruction of Ukraine's cities and continued increased Western demands for action from certainly from the population of most Western democracies.

Certainly, the images continue to get out.  RUSSIA ANNOUNCES SANCTIONS AGAINST BIDEN AND TOP US OFFICIALS  And so I think that what we ought to consider doing is a series of things. We certainly need to continue to supply the Ukrainians with the sort of anti-tank and anti-aircraft – shoulder-fired missiles that have been pouring into the country. I think we can go even further, though. We ought to offer training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. This was done, for example, in 1973 with the U.S. and Israel to improve Israel's level of training for some of the equipment that we were sending them. We ought to also allow, for example, the creation of a volunteer air force, something similar to what you saw in China, operating against the Japanese with the Flying Tigers in 1930, 1940, as well as the volunteer air force that fought the Bolsheviks on behalf of Poland in 1920.   Video Now Russia is going to complain, of course, but they're not likely to do anything because this is well within the norms of Cold War behavior. In other words, Russian pilots were known to have attacked American bombers during the Korean conflict in the 1950s. You had Russian air defense radar operators in North Vietnam during the Vietnam conflict, many of whom were responsible for downing American aircraft. And again, there was no war, no war between the Soviet Union and America because it wasn't direct. It wasn't, you know, someone in an American uniform attacking Russians on Russian soil.    Video And these are things, by the way, that have been recommended by this group that I'm working with called the Ukraine Working Group. It's a group mostly of academics in England and in North America, other European countries, that are trying to develop ideas as to how we can help Ukraine defend its independence, its sovereignty.

In fact, most Joint Meetings of Congress unfold in the House chamber. But Congress shifted the meeting to the Senate since the room is smaller and there wouldn’t be an embarrassment of open seats. All 96 Senate desks were filled with lawmakers, cabinet secretaries and  Supreme Court  justices. The  United Kingdom  declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939. So the U.K. had been at war for more than two years prior to the United States entering the fray in December 1941.  In a stark speech, Churchill predicted that allied powers would need a year-and-a-half before they could begin to see progress. Churchill also cautioned Americans about what was ahead as they joined the conflict. He said that ""many disappointments and unpleasant surprises await us."" Churchill warned those who would challenge the United Kingdom and the United States. US, UK VOW TO DEFEAT RUSSIA IN UKRAINE, BLINKEN 'ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT PUTIN WILL FAIL' ""What kind of a people do they think we are? Is it possible that they do not realize that we shall never cease to persevere against them until they have been taught a lesson which they and the world will never forget?,"" asked Churchill in the Senate chamber. He questioned if ""wicked men"" didn’t know ""they will be called to terrible account if they cannot beat down by force of arms the people they have assailed.""

   North Korea’s  latest weapons launch on Wednesday apparently ended in failure,  South Korea's  military said, amid speculation that the North could soon launch its biggest long-range missile in its most significant provocation in years. It wasn’t immediately clear what North Korea launched on Wednesday morning or at what stage it had an apparent failure. But the launch, the 10th of its kind this year, shows North Korea is determined to press ahead on its push to modernize its weapons arsenal and pressure its rivals into making concessions amid dormant denuclearization talks. South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing details of the launch made from the Pyongyang region around 9:30 a.m. that apparently failed, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that didn’t have further details. NORTH KOREA TESTS NEW ICBM MISSILE SYSTEM IN ‘SERIOUS ESCALATION,' US OFFICIAL SAYS     
      People watch a TV screen showing a news program reporting about North Korea's missile with file footage, at a train station in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, March 16, 2022.
       (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that a flight of a ballistic missile has not been confirmed and that Tokyo is working with Washington and Seoul to further analyze what happened. Experts say past failures still have moved North Korea closer to its goal of acquiring a viable nuclear arsenal that could threaten the American homeland. Of eight ""Musudan"" intermediate-range missiles tests in 2016, only one of those launches was seen by outside analysts as successful, which led to debates of whether North Korea’s path toward ICBMs had been cut off. However, the North in 2017 flew more powerful intermediate-range missiles over Japan and conducted three successful test-flights of ICBMs that demonstrated a potential range to strike deep into the U.S. mainland. North Korea’s successful satellite launches in 2012 and 2016 — which were viewed by the U.N. as disguised tests of its long-range missile technology — also followed repeated failures. The U.S. and South Korean militaries said last week that North Korea had tested an ICBM system in two recent launches, referring to the developmental Hwasong-17 missile that North Korea unveiled during a military parade in October 2020. In the two recent launches on Feb. 27 and March 5, the North Korean missiles flew medium-range distances, and experts have said North Korea could eventually perform a full-range ICBM test. The North has said it tested cameras and other systems for a spy satellite and released what it said were photos taken from space during one of the two tests, but it didn’t confirm what rocket or missile it launched. Observers say North Korea aims to boost its ICBM capability while trying to place its first spy satellite into orbit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to acquire an improved ICBM and a spy satellite among an array of sophisticated weapons systems he says his country needs to cope with what he calls American hostility.     
      North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends at a meeting of the Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang, North Korea on Feb. 28, 2022.
       (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP, File) The Hwasong-17 is North Korea’s biggest missile, which could potentially fly up to 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles), far enough to strike anywhere in the U.S. and beyond. The 25-meter (82-foot) missile, which was shown again at a defense exhibition in Pyongyang last year, has yet to be test-launched. The three ICBMs that North Korea tested in 2017 were the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15. Some analysts say developing a larger missile could mean the country is trying to arm its long-range weapons with multiple warheads to overcome missile defense systems. IMAGES ALLEGEDLY SHOW CONSTRUCTION AT NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR FACILITY THOUGHT TO BE DESTROYED If North Korea makes a new ICBM launch, it would be its highest-profile weapons tests since its third and last ICBM launch in November 2017. North Korea will likely call its potential new ICBM test a rocket launch to place a reconnaissance satellite in space, not a weapons test. That could invite condemnation but likely no fresh U.N. sanctions, some analysts say, since Russia and China wield vetoes on the Security Council and would oppose it. Other North Korean missiles tested this year were mostly shorter-range, nuclear-capable weapons which place South Korea and Japan, both key U.S. allies, within striking distance. In January alone, North Korea carried out seven rounds of missile tests, a record number of monthly tests since Kim took power in late 2011.     
      People watch a TV screen showing a news program reporting about North Korea's missile with file footage, at a train station in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, March 16, 2022.
       (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear program collapsed in 2019 due to wrangling over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.

734,Tucker Carlson: Biden's propaganda is meant to distract you from the real crises,Tucker Carlson,2022-03-16 00:01:00,"  close     Video   A lot of COVID regulations weren't really about science   Fox News host reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic two years later, China's new lockdowns and a cartel firefight on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   We keep a detailed daily calendar. We checked this morning and believe it or not, this week is the two-year anniversary of the coronavirus lockdowns. Those are the first mass quarantines in American history and if you look back, you'll be struck by how much has changed since those lockdowns began. Think back to the America you grew up in. There were three things you knew about that country: It was a free country. It was a middle-class country. It was defined by small business and it was a constitutional country. Our politicians were limited by the guardrails in our founding documents. They couldn't go past that. So, it was a happy place.   Unfortunately, none of those three things are still true about the United States and lockdowns are not entirely to blame for that. No single cause ever is, but there's no question that the coronavirus lockdowns accelerated the transformation of the United States. Just think of masks. So, we knew early on that paper masks were not going to stop the spread of COVID.   A couple of studies, including a big study from Vietnam, showed pretty clearly that they were not effective and then we watched the behavior of our public officials. It turns out they didn't like masks any more than anyone else liked masks, despite the fact they had ordered you to wear masks. When they thought no one was watching, they often went bare faced. So, you saw that, and you had to wonder: If masks are so darn effective and lifesaving, why aren't our leaders wearing them?   REPUBLICANS GO FOR KILL SHOT ON COVID TRANSPORTATION MASK MANDATES: ‘ABOUT TIME’

       ( I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg via Getty Images) We made that point. We made many points like it. We made them dozens of times on the show and, needless to say, it had no effect at all. The mask mandates stayed. In some places, they still remain. So, as this unfolded, we started to realize that masks, in fact a lot of this, was not really about  science  or public health. So, what was it about?   Well, recently we learned the answer because we watched it. Masks were a training exercise. Mandatory masking was a shock collar designed to teach Americans unquestioning obedience and, of course, it worked because shock collars do work. In a single day last month we watched, for example, our entire professional class dutifully changed their Twitter avatars from mask up to the now mandatory Ukrainian flag.   There was no debate about doing this, no reflection. There was not even a real conversation. They just did it. Millions of people simply assumed reflexively a partisan position in a highly complicated foreign crisis, the next crisis, and as they did it, they moved in perfect lockstep. They were guided by their masters of the social media companies who were themselves taking direction from the  White House .   The whole thing was like watching synchronized swimming in Pyongyang. It was an amazing performance. Most amazing of all was seeing Republican leaders join the herd after two years of COVID training, they couldn't help themselves. The result was the largest political flash mob in American history—Republicans, Democrats, business titans and the media all on one side.   So, of course, dissent of any kind was banned instantly and if you persist in asking questions about all of this found themselves censored and those who persisted in asking questions because they were lucky enough to have a rare, protected platform, found themselves threatened with something worse—maybe indictment, maybe arrest. Here's former Senator Claire McCaskill of  Missouri , threatening this show just last night.     CLAIRE MCCASKILL: Tucker Carlson and others are really, really close to treason in terms of what they are saying and parroting what is... Putin's dream.   Oh, so defending our country from your recklessness and unwise decision-making is treason? Declare your loyalty to Ukraine or you've committed a crime, right? Claire McCaskill, whatever you think of her, was not talking like that two years ago. No one in public was talking that way two years ago, before COVID. In a free country, you're allowed to say what you think is true. You can defend your country if you want, even if politicians disagree with you. That was the whole point of living in the United States, but not anymore.   Now, if enough powerful people, that would be former senators, New York Times columnists, retired Intel chiefs working as contributors to MSNBC, if enough of these people call for you to be indicted, you probably will be indicted. If not for the core crime, then for another crime. They'll find something. That's our justice system now works. Those are the rules. This is a big change over what we had before for about 250 years.  ANTI-COVID VACCINE MANDATE BISHOP IN PUERTO RICO RELIEVED OF LEADERSHIP BY VATICAN

       (Scott Olson/Getty Images) So how do we get this new system? Simple, we eliminated the guardrails. We got rid of the principles that set limits to our leaders' power. Those principles, in short, were personal autonomy and the sanctity of the citizens' conscience. And we surrendered both of those during COVID. They no longer exist. We let them go. Once we allowed political leaders to force Americans to take drugs they didn't want, the old arrangement where the citizen had as much or more power as the leaders was over. Our politicians now have effectively limitless power, and they know that. They know it perfectly well. That's why they did it and if you doubt that they know it, watch the way they communicate with the American population.   They're giving you propaganda. They always have. What's changed is that their propaganda is no longer sophisticated or persuasive because it doesn't have to be. Instead, their propaganda is blunt and vulgar. They summon TikTok performers to the White House so that some 18-year-old, who has never had a job, can tell you that inflation and historically high gas prices are actually  Vladimir Putin's  fault. They just did that, in fact. Here's the result.   ELLIE ZEILER, TIKTOK: I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down the street is $7 and here is what they said. … Russia is one of the top three producers of oil and it is actually their number one revenue source. … Now, with Putin starting this horrific fight between Ukraine and Russia, nobody wants to work with him and do international trade. So, with people being scared of war and limited resources, prices are bound to go up as well.   OK, so nothing against teenage energy expert in Lycra you just saw, but that is not the way you communicate with a population in a democracy. That's not the way you talk to free people. That is the way that you command your serfs. You assume that they're stupid and so you serve them up stupid propaganda. You patronize them like you're speaking to a housekeeper at a hotel in Cabo. ""We call this oil. It costs very much now. Vladimir Putin, very bad man."" That's what they're saying and they're saying it for a reason, because when you no longer respect your own citizens, you can't be bothered to speak in complex sentences.   You have TikTok influencers deliver your lines. All around this, this is happening even on former news channels. This is exactly what they're doing. That's their power, but it's not their main power. Their main power, the one they deploy most often, is the power to change the subject, the power to force you to ignore what actually matters to you and your family and your country, and focus instead on what matters to them. They call it democracy. Congress, at the moment, for example, is totally absorbed in the question of how to arm  Ukraine . How many MiGs should be sending to Zelenskyy and how do we get them there?   Now, that's not an issue that directly or even indirectly is related to the many, many...growing number of pressing problems the United States is facing domestically, but even on its own terms, even you think that's the most important thing that we could be talking about, they're not really talking about it in any complete sense and if you doubt that, ask yourself how you would handle it.   WASHINGTON POST PIECE HIGHLIGHTS HOW SCHOOLS THAT DID ‘LESS’ TO CONTAIN COVID ‘FLOURISHED’       
      The TikTok logo is seen on an iPhone 11 Pro max in this photo illustration in Warsaw, Poland on September 29, 2020. 
       (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) You're the Congress and you're moved by the suffering in Ukraine. Every American is. Americans are kind people. They want to help. Civilians in Ukraine are being crushed by Vladimir Putin. That's true. How can we help? Well, why don't we send more weapons to Ukraine in the middle of a war? It doesn't sound like a bad idea, but if you're going to make that decision, you'd probably feel some kind of moral obligation to consider the ramifications. Like, what effect will this actually have? Is it possible that doing this, as well-intentioned as it is, (and it is) is it possible doing this will be counterproductive? Will it hurt the people I'm hoping to help?   Will it, for example, prolong the fighting in Ukraine at the expense of the vulnerable civilian population in Ukraine? If I do this, could I inadvertently be doing to Ukraine what the West inadvertently did to, let's say, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Afghanistan? You wouldn't want that. You'd hate to do something like that again, because that would be cruel. So, you'd want to make sure you weren't doing that. But not a single person in Washington, at least in public, appears to be asking that question. No one's allowed to ask that question. What are you a Putin defender? And in fact, as well-meaning as most Americans are—most of our lawmakers are well-meaning—you get the sense that the core figures in our foreign policy establishment don't really care. And in fact, never have cared about the effects of their policy.   We can give you a million examples. Here's one: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright way back in 1996, shrugged off the documented deaths of half a million Iraqi children. Not a small number, half a million, because imposing sanctions on Saddam Hussein was ""worth it.""     LESLEY STAHL: We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died when in Hiroshima and, you know, is the price worth it?   MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it. It is a moral question, but the moral question is even a larger one. Don't we owe, to the American people, and to the American military, and to the other countries in the region that this man not be a threat?   So, keep in mind that debate, that conversation, was about sanctions, which were certainly going to hurt Saddam Hussein. They didn't. He ended up invading seven years later because sanctions didn't work. When have sanctions worked exactly to achieve their desired outcome? Let us know when you find out, but in the meantime, a half a million children died, but it was worth it. Because, because why?   MIAMI BEACH PREPARING FOR UNRULY SPRING BRREAK CROWDS

       (Mike Pont/Getty Images) Well, in retrospect, sadly, and it burdens the conscience of every decent person, it's hard to see why it was worth it, but you should know that these are exactly the same people who are now giving you more lectures right now. In fact, at this very moment on every other channel on television, 24 hours a day, about how we have a moral obligation to wade blindly into a war in Eastern Europe against a country that has not attacked us and if we don't do that, you're a traitor.   What's going on here? High levels of aggression, that's for sure, but deflection too. Our leaders are a master of deflection. They yell so you won't notice what else is happening. What else is happening? Well, it turns out one of the biggest stories of the decade dropped this morning, you may not even be aware of it, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is considering accepting Chinese currency rather than U.S. dollars for its oil sales to China now. Why is that a big deal? Seems like some little financial story. Well, because it would spell the end of the petrodollar. The petrodollar is one of the keys to the United States' wealth.   Saudi Arabia has traded oil exclusively in U.S. dollars for nearly half a century and that is one of the key reasons the United States has the highest living standard of any big country in the world, despite the fact that our manufacturing sector long ago collapsed. You may have wondered how that worked. Why are we still so rich? Well, this is how. Petrodollars allow our government, in short, to spend money that we don't have and that money pays for an awful lot of what we have—healthcare, retirements, the military. We could go on—everything, essentially.  As economist Gal Luft put it in interview with The Wall Street Journal today, ""The oil market and by extension, the entire global commodities market, is the insurance policy of the status of the dollar is the reserve currency. If that block is taken out of the wall, the wall will begin to collapse.""  What's the wall? Well, it's the U.S. economy. Not a small story, maybe even a bigger story than the invasion of Ukraine. Weird that we're not talking about it. Meanwhile, at the exact same moment that happened there's this: The Chinese government has decided to wound our already teetering economy once again by using the pretext of COVID. So, the Chinese have ordered lockdowns in factory towns, towns that make Toyotas, Volkswagen, circuit boards, air conditioning units, batteries, televisions and, yes, iPhones.   Now why are they doing this? Well, you're supposed to believe it's all about the coronavirus, which has mysteriously resurged in China in the middle of a war in which China is siding with the country that we are against, Russia. Can that really be true? Hard to believe. Is it really just the virus that's causing this behavior? Yes, say the propagandists of The Washington Post, it definitely is. It's definitely not a trade war brought on by the Biden administration's incompetence in international affairs. We're not suffering for the fact they don't know what they're doing. No, it's just a virus.   BIDEN TO ANNOUNCE $1 BILLION IN MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE     Video A pundit called Catherine Rampell, for example, told us with a straight face that, ""Daily COVID cases in China have reached numbers not publicly reported since 2020...Thanks partly to low vaccination rates for the elderly in China, plus the relative ineffectiveness of Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines, the Chinese government has responded to outbreaks with an iron fist.""  They should have gone with Pfizer like we did. Now none of that, of course, explains why cases are higher in China now that they were in the beginning of the pandemic, but The Washington Post doesn't want you to think about that. They want you to think about vaccines. It was all about vaccines. It turns out the Chinese have a pandemic of the unvaccinated too, and don't they deserve it?   Speaking of news you may not be hearing about, a hot war is in progress 50 yards from Texas, which is an American state. No one seems to notice that either because we're focused on Ukraine. According to one report, a Mexican cartel engaged local authorities in a shootout for more than three hours. There were burning trucks with no one responding to them. That's a war.   The U.S. Consulate has just warned Americans to avoid the area or secure shelter. That's our southern border, over which two million people flowed this year with no restraints whatsoever. Meanwhile, in our country, a convoy of American citizens dared to peacefully protest their own government as they assume the Constitution guaranteed them the right to do and yet they have been blocked unconstitutionally from entering their own capital city, Washington, D.C.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP     Video It's not just truckers who are banned from entering Washington, D.C., it's everyone. D.C. police somehow were allowed to block off many exits yesterday to drivers for more than two hours. This is the same city that rewarded violent Black Lives Matter protesters with a mural. So maybe you're for that, maybe you're not, but in normal times, that would be a big story because our constitutional rights are wrapped up in it and we should be debating what the limits of those rights are, how much power our politicians have, how much power we want them to have, but we're not because Ukraine, because you changed your Twitter name to the Ukrainian flag.  It's the new crisis. You're not supposed to pay attention to any of the other crises, particularly here at home.    This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the March 15, 2022 edition of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

   In her "" Ingraham Angle "" commentary on Tuesday, host  Laura Ingraham  described what she called the latest iteration of ""false flags"" as consensus among the Left and neoconservative officials who used to decry America as racist and xenophobic.

In response, her comments were branded treasonous by Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and throughout the left-wing voices in media. ""OK, if you can believe that one, they're now throwing around the ‘T’ word because Tulsi Gabbard dared to question the rush-to-war mindset."" Ingraham described how figures responding pragmatically to Russia's invasion rather than siding completely with prevailing political winds are suddenly considered insufficiently American or somehow supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   China’s Ministry of Defense on Thursday threatened to impose the  ""worst consequences"" on countries  helping Taiwan defend itself.  ""The Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of China, which brooks no outside interference,"" a ministry spokesperson told reporters. ""No one and no force can stop the historical trend that  China will solve the Taiwan question  and realize a complete national reunification. To anyone who makes troubles on the Taiwan question: The higher you jump the harder you fall.""    Video Revealingly, China Military Online, an official English-language site of  China’s People’s Liberation Army , translated the last sentence of the spokesperson’s words this way: ""Anyone who makes troubles on the Taiwan question will suffer the worst consequences in the end.""  IN UKRAINIAN CRISIS, CHINA IS PART OF PROBLEM. DOES EUROPE GET IT? Usually, Beijing’s official English translations soften Chinese texts. This is one of the rare cases where the opposite is true, indicating the Chinese military is itching to use its nuclear weapons.  The belligerent warning was issued a day after contentious talks between Chinese ruler Xi Jinping and Australian officials. The Chinese side was particularly incensed by comments from Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton, who pledged full support for Taiwan. ""Whatever we can,"" Dutton said, referring to Australian aid to the island republic.    Video The People’s Republic of China claims Taiwan is a breakaway province. The island, formally the Republic of China, maintains it is a sovereign state.  The disagreement between Beijing and Taipei is a leftover of the still-unresolved Chinese civil war. The U.S. position is that Taiwan’s status is unresolved and must not be settled without the consent of its people. These days, Taiwan’s people overwhelmingly self identify as Taiwanese, not Chinese, and refuse to be forcibly incorporated into the Chinese communist state. Beijing has repeatedly reserved for itself the right to use force to annex Taiwan.  Can it be any coincidence that, after having seen Putin successfully issue nuke threats, Beijing is adopting the same intimidation tactics?   Beijing also promises to use the world’s most destructive weapons if it has to. Its threat on Thursday follows similar warnings.  Last July, the Chinese regime threatened to incinerate Japan over its support for Taiwan. In September, China issued a nuke threat against Australia because it was working with the U.S. and U.K. to maintain stability in the region. Before that, Chinese generals and civilian propagandists had made, over the course of decades, unprovoked threats to destroy American cities.  Vladimir Putin has been issuing nuke threats of his own. Moments before the Ukraine invasion, the Russian president warned of ""consequences that you have never experienced in your history."" On Feb. 27, he put nuclear forces on ""special combat readiness,"" high alert. Russia sortied ballistic missile submarines and land-based mobile missile launchers on March 1 in what was called a drill.    Video For almost a decade, Russian doctrine has been to ""escalate to deescalate"" or ""escalate to win,"" in other words, to threaten or even use nuclear weapons early in a conventional conflict or crisis. As Hudson Institute senior fellow and GeoStrategic Analysis president Peter Huessy told me this month, escalating to win assumes nuclear threats will ""coerce an enemy to stand down and not fight.""  Many believe President Biden is not fighting harder to save Ukraine because he fears Russia will use its nuclear arsenal. Can it be any coincidence that, after having seen Putin successfully issue nuke threats, Beijing is adopting the same intimidation tactics? ""Like Vladimir Putin, the Communist Party of China has lost its fear of American power,"" Richard Fisher of the Virginia-based International Assessment and Strategy Center said to me this week. ""China’s nuclear threats expose the party’s arrogance in the face of perceived American weakness, expose the risk of the lack of a U.S. regional nuclear deterrent, and expose the inadequacy of U.S. leadership.""    Video In January, Biden agreed with the Russian Federation to extend the New START Treaty, which generally limits deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550. China is not a party to any nuclear arms-control deals and has generally refused to join in any negotiations.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As Fisher, Huessy and others point out, Russia and China could gang up on America to achieve nuclear dominance. China is both developing hypersonic glide vehicles, which can drop out of space and hit American cities, and is rapidly building up its store of ballistic missiles, digging at least 250 and perhaps as many as 345 silos in three separate fields for its DF-41 missile.    Video A DF-41 is capable of carrying 10 warheads and has a range of 9,300 miles, which means it can reach all the U.S. from the new Chinese sites. The silos, along with hypersonic tests, suggest Beijing no longer seeks only a ""minimal deterrent.""  The Chinese military, from all indications, is building a nuclear ""war-fighting"" capability, hoping to intimidate others into submission. The specter of China imposing ""worst consequences"" means the U.S. should not remain in any nuclear arms-control agreement as long as China refuses to limit its arsenal. America cannot allow itself to be outgunned. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Fisher says, China is indeed intent on ""murdering"" Taiwan’s democracy, and we should not be making it any easier for it to do so.  And it cannot be a good sign that Russia and China are making nuke threats at the same time.

At the time,  American President Biden  said he was convinced Russian President  Vladimir Putin  had decided to invade Ukraine and that he believed Russian forces would target Kyiv ""in the coming week"" or sooner. KATHERYN WINNICK SAYS ZELENSKYY IS 'PERFECT EXAMPLE' OF 'UKRAINIAN STRONG': 'A TRUE LEADER' ""I remember he spoke about how they noticed many soldiers on the border of Ukraine and that they would invade,"" Didusenko explained. ""Putin had pretty much set the date. After I heard that speech, I really started to get worried about the safety of our country, of my family, and all of those in Ukraine. I would check the news all the time. That's why I had my suitcase ready. Just in case."" ""I spoke to many of my friends and some said, ‘We’re staying, we don’t believe Putin is going to go this mad, this violent and start a war,’"" she continued. ""But I was very frightened. Even after Biden’s speech, I remember I went to a café in Kyiv, and there were so many foreigners. I was sitting there, thinking, ‘What are they doing here? Why are they still in Ukraine after all of these announcements and warnings? After the Biden administration said Americans need to leave Ukraine as soon as possible?’ But people were sitting there having their lunch. Everything was peaceful. There was no sign of a Russian invasion to come.""

       (The Press Service of Veronika Didusenko) Since the invasion occurred, hundreds have been reported dead or wounded, including children. According to the United Nations, more than a million Ukrainians have also fled to safety. The attack, ordered by Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world as well as increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia. For Didusenko, she was determined to find safety for herself and her 7-year-old. She, along with thousands of other families, left the city. Countless cars formed a traffic jam on the highway on the way out of Kyiv that lasted for hours, she said.

I was driving with military cars on one side and tanks on the other side with Russian helicopters flying above my head. I was very scared for my life and my son’s. There wasn’t enough food, enough water. You especially couldn’t sleep with the sirens going on all the time. Every noise from a car or plane made me look around. I was worried that it was a rocket, a bomb or someone shooting. I can’t even begin to imagine what the people who stayed are going through. I knew I had to survive.""

Didusenko noted how lucky she was, as not everyone had the chance to flee. She noted that bridges have been destroyed since she left and others have been killed in their attempt to find refuge. ""All that mattered to me was saving my son’s life,"" she said. ""I just took my stuff and left quickly. At that moment, you don’t care about anything else. You’re just thinking of finding safety, a place where there are no rockets, bombs or sirens. It’s the only thing you can think of to try to save your life."" According to Didusenko, she and her child traveled through three countries before they finally arrived in Switzerland, where she had friends. After arriving in Geneva, she headed to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled months in advance to speak alongside Gloria Allred on March 8 - International Women’s Day. Her goal this time, she said, was to make a public plea on behalf of Ukrainians under attack. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

       (Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images) ""I wanted to speak about the war, about the devastation in Ukraine that I witnessed with my eyes,"" she said. ""I wanted people to understand what was going on. I have a U.S. visa, but my son doesn’t have one. I went to the United States embassy in Luxembourg to apply for a visa for him. But he was denied. The embassy did not issue a visa for my son. I was so shocked. They said to me, ‘You can leave your son in Europe with your friends and go to the U.S.’ And I was like, ‘Are you serious? After the bombing in Kyiv, after everything we experienced, I now have to leave my son in Europe?’"" ""This is a horrible situation,"" she said. ""So many women and children who’ve fled cannot truly enter the United States because they cannot be issued a visa in time. During my press conference with Gloria Allred, we spoke about the fact that women and children fleeing for their lives must be given something like temporary protected status or humanitarian parole so that they can have a chance to go to the United States if they wanted to."" Didusenko said friends in Switzerland, who had moved to Geneva six months prior, volunteered to care for Alex while she traveled to Los Angeles. During her talk with Fox News Digital, Didusenko was headed to LAX to take a flight back to Geneva. She has since been reunited with Alex.

But he also understands that I would do everything to protect him.""

According to the outlet, she started the nonprofit Right to Be a Mother in hopes of changing the rules for the Miss World and Miss Universe pageants.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
   Russia 's invasion of Ukraine upended Chinese President Xi Jinping's timetable to invade Taiwan, according to documents purportedly written by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies.  ""Xi Jinping was at least considering taking over Taiwan in the fall - he needs his own little victory to get re-elected for a third term - there the struggle within the elite is colossal,"" an agent in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, allegedly wrote on March 9. China will hold its 20th Communist Party Congress this fall, and Xi has said it will be a "" major event ."" Analysts have predicted that Xi will either be re-elected as the general secretary of the Communist Party or be elected to the chairmanship of the party, a position that has not existed since 1982.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""Now, after the Ukrainian events, this window of opportunity has been closed to him, which gives the United States the opportunity to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with its competitors on favorable terms,"" the FSB agent added. ""It was in this case that we launched a trap mechanism for China with our actions.""

""The global clash between the US and China was inevitable,"" the agent wrote. ""After the war with Ukraine (although I may avoid using the term ‘operation’ here), the cost of resources in the world, especially energy ones, has gone up. The main victim of such actions becomes China, to which (I can confirm) were given guarantees that everything will end quickly. Therefore, China behaved tolerant in the past. But that was before that."" ""China may well give us a tough ultimatum to end the war to stabilize oil prices,"" the agent predicted. ""If this happens, I don't want to predict anything - it's just on the horizon of disaster events.""

TULSI GABBARD:  They're afraid of the truth. They're afraid of even a single voice coming out as challenging the power elite, questioning them, daring to hold a dissenting view. And they're afraid because their arguments are so weak that they know they will not withstand the light of the truth. And this is why we're seeing not only still most of the mainstream media very vigorously defending and pushing the Biden propaganda. It's not enough. They're going to YouTubers, they're going to TikTokers.

None of this is enough because they won't stop. And it's not just the Biden administration, it's not just Democrats. It's the power elite. It's the neo-cons and the neo-libs working together to make sure that every single voice in this country, anybody who's got a platform, is spouting their narrative that they want people to see and hear their propaganda.

BIDEN TO ANNOUNCE $1 BILLION IN MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE Members of Congress have stopped short of calling for a no-fly zone, with many echoing Biden’s concerns. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday said Biden ""continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory, could prompt a war with Russia.""  ""I don’t believe there is a lot of advocates calling for that at this point in time from Capitol Hill, but we certainly understand and recognize that is still a call from President Zelenskyy,"" Psaki said.

The Pentagon last week rejected Poland’s proposal for the U.S. and NATO to deliver MiG-29 planes to the Ukrainian military, arguing that the move could be mistaken as ""escalatory"" and could result in ""significant Russian reaction"" that could increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO.  ""We recognize there are a range of bipartisan calls, but what we have the responsibility to do here is to assess what the impact is on the United States and our own national security,"" Psaki said.

       (REUTERS/Oleksandr Lapshyn) Biden and NATO have ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying that enforcing it would put the U.S. and NATO in direct confrontation with Russia and would expand the conflict. WHITE HOUSE INSISTS NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE 'COULD PROMPT A WAR WITH RUSSIA' Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so it is not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked, all member countries will take action to assist. On Monday, the parliament of Estonia called for U.N. member states to ""take immediate steps to establish a no-fly zone"" over Ukraine to prevent further civilian casualties as war rages on. Estonia is the first NATO member nation to have a body formally call for the implementation of a no-fly zone amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.     
      Several buildings in Starobilsk within the Luhansk Oblast region of Ukraine show significant damage because of shelling, according to images shared by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.
       (State Emergency Service of Ukraine) Psaki said the White House disagrees with Estonia’s argument that a no-fly zone ""would be an effective step because a no-fly zone, which often people shorthand, essentially means, shooting down Russian planes and then potentially shooting back at us."" Over on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the United States needs to do ""anything we can to help our Ukrainian allies, short of putting our troops across the NATO line.""  As for Zelenskyy's requests for a no-fly zone, McConnell said: ""He knows we are not going to enforce a no-fly zone in Ukraine."" Zelenskyy earlier this month spoke on a Zoom video call with more than 280 members of Congress. During the call, Zelenskyy requested more lethal aid, planes and additional sanctions – specifically to shut down Russian oil imports. Since that call, Biden announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting ""the main artery"" of Russia’s economy amid President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.

Revoking Russia's ""most favored nation"" status will allow for increased tariffs on imports from the country in addition to the crushing sanctions already imposed as a consequence of  Russia's invasion of Ukraine . But it must be done by Congress. Biden highlighted bipartisan support for the move in a Friday announcement in conjunction with other G7 and European Union leaders.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: BIPARTISAN LAWMAKERS URGE BIDEN TO WORK WITH POLAND TO PROVIDE MIG-29S TO UKRAINE On top of banning of goods and oil, Biden last month sanctioned major Russian banks, including VTB, Sberbank, Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC and Novikombank. The sanctions made it harder for Russia to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.  The U.S. sanctions also target Russia elites: Sergei Ivanov and his son Sergei, Andrey Patrushev and his son Nikolai, Igor Sechin and his son Ivan, Andrey Puchkov, Yuriy Solviev and two real estate companies he owns, Galina Ulyutina and Alexander Vedyakhin. The sanctions also limit the borrowing opportunities for 13 Russian entities and enterprises, according to the U.S.: Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot and Russian Railways. The U.S. and its partners have also said they would go after the  Russian military and Belarusian  individuals and entities for their support for the invasion. Also last month, the United States, Canada and European allies announced additional sanctions that would remove ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT financial system.

   A  North Korean  missile fired from its capital region exploded soon after liftoff in an apparent failed weapons launch on Wednesday,  South Korea’s  military said, amid speculation that the North is preparing to launch its longest-range missile in its most significant provocation in years. Details of the missile explosion weren’t immediately known. But the launch, the 10th of its kind this year, shows North Korea is determined to press ahead on its push to modernize its weapons arsenal and pressure its rivals into making concessions amid dormant  denuclearization  talks. The North Korean missile blew up while it was flying at an altitude of less than 20 kilometers (12.4 miles), a South Korean military official said requesting anonymity because he wasn’t publicly authorized to speak to media on the issue. He said the cause of the explosion wasn’t known. NORTH KOREA TESTS NEW ICBM MISSILE SYSTEM IN 'SERIOUS ESCALATION,' US OFFICIAL SAYS South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier said that the launch was made from the Pyongyang region around 9:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) but gave no other details. Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said the missile likely exploded less than a minute after its launch. He said if the missile’s toxic fuels fell on civilian residential areas in North Korea, they would likely cause a major health impact. There was no immediate outside report of such damages in North Korea.     
      In this photo provided by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a meeting of the Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Feb. 28, 2022.
       (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP, File) The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command later said that North Korea had fired a ballistic missile but didn’t say whether it was a failed launch. A command statement said the launch didn’t pose an immediate threat to U.S. territory and its allies but called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts. Japanese  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that a flight of a ballistic missile has not been confirmed and that Tokyo is working with Washington and Seoul to further analyze what happened. Experts say past failures have moved North Korea closer to its goal of acquiring a viable nuclear arsenal that could threaten the American homeland. Of eight ""Musudan"" intermediate-range missiles tests in 2016, only one of those launches was seen by outside analysts as successful, which led to debates of whether North Korea’s path toward ICBMs had been cut off. IMAGES ALLEGEDLY SHOW CONSTRUCTION AT NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR FACILITY THOUGHT TO BE DESTROYED However, the North in 2017 flew more powerful intermediate-range missiles over Japan and conducted three successful test-flights of ICBMs that demonstrated a potential range to strike deep into the U.S. mainland. North Korea’s successful satellite launches in 2012 and 2016 — which were viewed by the U.N. as disguised tests of its long-range missile technology — also followed repeated failures. The U.S. and South Korean militaries said last week that  North Korea had tested an ICBM system  in two recent launches, referring to the developmental Hwasong-17 missile, the North’s biggest weapon, which it unveiled during a military parade in October 2020.     
      People watch a TV screen showing a news program reporting about North Korea's missile with file footage, at a train station in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, March 16, 2022. 
       (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) In the two recent launches on Feb. 27 and March 5, the North Korean missiles flew medium-range distances, and experts have said North Korea likely tested the first stage rocket of the Hwasong-17 missile. It wasn’t clear if Wednesday’s launch also involved parts of the Hwasong-17. After its two previous launches, North Korea said it had tested cameras and other systems  for a spy satellite  and released what it said were photos taken from space during one of the two tests, but it didn’t confirm what rocket or missile it launched. Observers say North Korea aims to boost its ICBM capability while trying to place its first functioning spy satellite into orbit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to acquire an improved ICBM and a spy satellite among an array of sophisticated weapons systems he says his country needs to cope with what he calls American hostility. BIDEN ADMIN CONDEMNS NORTH KOREA MISSILE LAUNCH, SEEKS 'SERIOUS AND SUSTAINED DIPLOMACY' WITH DPRK Earlier Wednesday, North Korea’s state news agency released photos of a smiling Kim, clad in a long black leather coat, visiting a towering apartment complex under construction on the outskirts of Pyongyang. The news agency didn’t say when Kim was there, but it typically reports on his public activities one or two days after they occur. The Hwasong-17 could potentially fly up to 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles), far enough to strike anywhere in the U.S. and beyond. The 25-meter (82-foot) missile, which was shown again at a defense exhibition in Pyongyang last year, has yet to be test-launched. The three ICBMs that North Korea tested in 2017 were the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15. Some analysts say developing a larger missile could mean the country is trying to arm its long-range weapons with multiple warheads to overcome missile defense systems.

       (Hong Ki-won/Yonhap via AP) If North Korea makes a new ICBM launch, it would be its highest-profile weapons tests since its third and last ICBM launch in November 2017. North Korea may call its potential new ICBM test a rocket launch to place a reconnaissance satellite in space, not a weapons test. That could invite condemnation but likely no fresh U.N. sanctions, some analysts say, since  Russia  and  China  wield vetoes on the Security Council and would oppose it. Other North Korean missiles tested this year were mostly shorter-range, nuclear-capable weapons which place South Korea and Japan, both key U.S. allies, within striking distance. In January alone, North Korea carried out seven rounds of missile tests, a record number of monthly tests since Kim took power in late 2011.

The Pentagon last week rejected Poland’s proposal for the U.S. and NATO to deliver MiG-29 planes to the Ukrainian military, arguing that the move could be mistaken as ""escalatory"" and could result in ""significant Russian reaction"" that could increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO.  ""We recognize there are a range of bipartisan calls, but what we have the responsibility to do here is to assess what the impact is on the United States and our own national security,"" Psaki said. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so it is not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked, all member countries will take action to assist.

Biden is set to travel to Brussels, Belgium, next week for a NATO summit to ""discuss the ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies.""  Biden is also set to join a scheduled European Council Summit to discuss ""shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those effected by the violence, and to address other challenges related to the conflict.""  The White House said Biden's ""goal"" is ""to meet in person, face to face, with his European counterparts and talk about and assess where we are at this point in the conflict.""  ""The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy,"" Psaki said, adding that the summit is ""an opportunity to do exactly that.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for whether Biden will meet with Zelenskyy during his trip to Europe, Psaki said the White House is ""still finalizing the trip at this point in time.""

   In the days before  Russia  invaded Ukraine,  Vladimir Putin  rattled his nuclear saber. Hard. He personally oversaw massive military exercises that featured multiple ""practice launches"" of nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missiles. He threatened Western nations with ""consequences you have never seen"" if they dared intervene to help the  Ukrainians . As Moscow’s illegal and immoral war proceeded, Putin followed up by ordering Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert, prompting concern over just how far he will go. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES A Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine—or worse, against a NATO state—is unlikely. Doing so would break a 75-year nuclear taboo and completely alienate the rest of the world. But the chances are not zero, either. The U.S. must take the threat seriously. Russia has over 2,000 low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons. These are short-range systems—ground- and sea-based missiles or rockets as well as warheads dropped from jets—that can be brought to bear on European battlefields. By treaty, the U.S. and Russia have roughly comparable stockpiles of nuclear armed long-range missiles—those able to reach each other’s homelands. But when it comes to these short-range tactical nukes, Russia holds at least a 10 to 1 advantage.

It would also be unjustified, morally reprehensible, and potentially criminal if used against Ukraine, which poses no threat to Russian security.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER NATO would not be obligated to respond militarily, but a nuclear attack on Ukraine would likely lead to further Russian isolation from the world and unite every country—potentially even current holdouts like China and India—against Putin. A nuclear attack on a NATO state is less likely. Putin knows that such an attack would trigger an in-kind response. But short of firing a nuclear weapon at a NATO state, Putin may issue further nuclear threats to dissuade the West from intervening militarily, or even from sending additional military equipment to Ukraine.  ZELENSKYY ‘GRATEFUL’ TO RUSSIAN REPORTER WHO INTERRUPTED LIVE COVERAGE WITH ‘NO WAR’ SIGN While Putin has no qualms about flexing his nuclear muscle, he cannot afford to forget that NATO is a nuclear alliance.

   The Biden administration  announced Wednesday that it is designating  Afghanistan  for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) – granting protection from deportation to the tens of thousands of Afghans who were brought in without a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) in the wake of the frantic U.S withdrawal in August. TPS protects nationals of designated countries living in the U.S. from potential deportation if they are eligible, allows them to apply for work permits and gives them the freedom to travel. PENTAGON IG REPORT SAYS 50 AFGHAN EVACUEES BROUGHT TO US HAD ‘POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT SECURITY CONCERNS' It is based on three grounds: armed ongoing conflict, environmental disasters or ""extraordinary and temporary conditions."" The Afghanistan designation is for an initial 18 months, although designations are frequently extended, and only applies to those living in the U.S. as of Tuesday.

       (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Isaiah Campbell) The U.S. has so far evacuated more than 76,000  Afghans  out of the region, and has been engaged in a significant resettlement operation that has seen Afghans moved to military bases and ultimately to communities in states like Virginia, California and Texas. DHS estimates that only about 40% of those qualify for an SIV – available to those who worked for the U.S. or its allies during the 20-year conflict. The evacuations were supported by lawmakers in both parties, but have seen criticism over  alleged flaws in the vetting system . The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that it designated Afghanistan due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent the country’s nationals from returning safely. It cited not only the brutal Taliban control, but also a collapsing public sector, economic crisis, increasing crime and food and water insecurity. ""This TPS designation will help to protect Afghan nationals who have already been living in the United States from returning to unsafe conditions,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. ""Under this designation, TPS will also provide additional protections and assurances to trusted partners and vulnerable Afghans who supported the U.S. military, diplomatic, and humanitarian missions in Afghanistan over the last 20 years."" BIDEN ADMINISTRATION GIVES PROTECTION FROM DEPORTATION TO UKRAINIANS LIVING IN US   Video Immigration hawks said the designation shows that many of the Afghans allowed in are ineligible for SIVs and accused Mayorkas of an ""intention delay"" in designating Afghanistan for TPS to get more evacuees in. ""Secretary Mayorkas didn’t do it right after our botched withdrawal to protect Afghans already here, but instead because he wanted to increase the amount of Afghans in the country to benefit,"" RJ Hauman, head of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) said in a statement. ""Now he has a sufficient Afghan population on U.S. soil, and suddenly a TPS designation is warranted."" It is the latest use of TPS by the administration, most recently designating or redesignating Ukraine, Sudan and South Sudan. Hauman said Mayorkas is ""clearly committed to using every world conflict or weather event to grant de-facto amnesty through the deeply-flawed TPS program."" ""But this designation takes TPS abuse to the next level – purposely increasing an eligible population and then issuing the designation around six months later,"" he said. ""Does Congress even care about this unprecedented abuse of authority?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Immigration advocates took a different view of the Afghanistan designation, presenting it as a welcome first step but also renewing calls for legislation to grant Afghans permanent residency in the United States. ""TPS is critically needed for Afghanistan. As we commend the Biden administration for this decision, we also urge a comprehensive response to the crisis in Afghanistan, including passing the Afghan Adjustment Act, and responding to other humanitarian and protection needs in line with the priorities of impacted people,"" Lisa Parisio, director of advocacy at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network (CLINIC) said in a statement. Advocacy groups have also pushed for additional TPS designations: ""The administration can and should use this readily-available tool more broadly, for all people in the U.S. in need of protection, including immediate TPS designations for Ethiopia, Cameroon and Mauritania,"" Parisio said.

Zelenskyy said Tuesday that barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and killed dozens. The strikes disrupted the relative calm that returned after an initial advance by Moscow’s forces was stopped in the early days of the war. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s assessment, said that the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets inside Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country.

Before Tuesday’s talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would press its demands that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO, adopt a neutral status and ""demilitarize.""

   Afghan refugees in the United States will be allowed to stay for at least 18 months under temporary protected status, the government said Wednesday, a move that will help some of the thousands who arrived following  the chaotic American withdrawal  from their country. The Afghans must already be in the U.S. and pass a background check to qualify for the program, which is intended to help thousands who were evacuated to the U.S. under a short-term status known as humanitarian parole as  their country fell to the Taliban . BIDEN ADMIN GIVES TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AFGHAN EVACUEES For many, however, time is running out because they have not yet received permanent residency through backlogged programs such as the special immigrant visa, which is issued to people who worked as interpreters or in some other capacity for the U.S. and its allies during  the 20-year war . In the meantime, their country has spiraled into  a deep economic crisis  under Taliban rule, and millions of them are  at risk of starvation . ""This TPS designation will help to protect Afghan nationals who have already been living in the United States from returning to unsafe conditions,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement announcing the move.

       (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) More than 76,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. following the U.S. withdrawal in August. Homeland Security has said that about 40% will eventually qualify for a special immigrant visa, a lengthy and complex process that ultimately provides permanent legal residency and a path to citizenship. Most have now settled in communities around the U.S., with the largest numbers moving to the Northern Virginia-Washington, D.C., area; Northern California; and Texas. Refugee advocates have been urging the Biden administration to designate Afghanistan for temporary protected status to prevent Afghans from becoming stranded without legal residency status when their two years of humanitarian parole expires. CENTCOM COMMANDER: ISIS ATTACKS WILL 'RAMP UP' IN SUMMER AS TALIBAN STRUGGLES TO KEEP THEM AT BAY ""We welcome this designation as an important affirmation that Afghans already in the United States cannot return safely to their homeland,"" said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. ""In resettling thousands of Afghan families since the evacuation, we have heard heartbreaking testimonials of devastating and devolving conditions in Afghanistan. Many of their loved ones remain in-country and still desperately need our help to reach safety."" The refugee advocates also have pressed Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would grant the Afghans permanent residency and enable them to apply for U.S. citizenship, as was done for refugees in the past, including for people from Cuba, Vietnam and Iraq.   Video The AfghanEvac coalition, which includes about 100 organizations and has been calling on the U.S. government to help get more Afghans out of their country, welcomed the temporary protected status decision as ""an appreciated Band-Aid.""

   NATO Secretary-General  Jens Stoltenberg  acknowledged on Wednesday that the 30-member alliance could have done more to help Ukraine in the lead-up to the  Russian invasion  three weeks ago. Following an extraordinary meeting with NATO defense ministers, Stoltenberg told reporters the alliance is looking to ""reset"" its deterrence and defense systems in the face of Russian aggression – including how it aids non-NATO nations.

""But it's also putting more pressure on those countries in our neighborhood who are not members of NATO."" Stoltenberg said nations like Georgia, which was formally a part of the Soviet Union and struggled under a Russian invasion in 2008, face an increased threat from Moscow aggression.  ""One of the lessons we have to learn from what is going on in Ukraine today is that we need to support these countries, which are at risk now,"" Stoltenberg told reporters. ""If anything, I think we now see the value of the support that has been provided to Ukraine before the invasion, but also the importance of that we could have done even more for Ukraine."" The secretary-general said officials in each NATO nation have been tasked with developing military defenses across every arena, including land, air, sea, cyber and space, to counter the threat that Russia poses.  Defense systems, coordinated military trainings and pre-positioned equipment in the Eastern European flank will be advanced in an effort to ensure Moscow understands NATO’s force posture. There are hundreds of thousands of troops on heightened alert in  Europe , including 100,000 U.S. troops, Stoltenberg said but added that every NATO nation needed to invest at least 2% of its GDP in defense.

At that stage we actually foresaw Russia as a strategic partner,"" he said. ""Since then Russia has invaded Georgia, illegally annexed Crimea and now also invaded Ukraine."" Despite NATO’s renewed promise to aid Ukraine with military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid, the alliance once again said it will not block Russian air capabilities.  Just moments after Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  made an impassioned plea to the U.S.  Congress  and  President Biden  to institute a no-fly zone, Stoltenberg said NATO is united in opposing the move.

In response, Cotton said Biden could indeed stop his custom of engaging in ""half-measures"" and being ""a day late and a dollar short."" ""Last week, for instance, he came out and gave a very chesty speech about how we're going to ban the import of oil into America from Russia. We're still importing Russian oil.

In this place, I think you have it right. We should be providing all the tools that the Ukrainian people need to defend themselves. We have them. The Europeans have them. They can do an awful lot more, too, but instead, President Biden has been behind. He's allowed Vladimir Putin to dictate the pace and the response....He's allowed Vladimir Putin to...dominate how we think about the structure of what's taking place here and we can do better than this.

   Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday said President Biden should deploy additional U.S. military forces to Eastern Europe and expand his travel next week to go ""beyond"" Brussels, while casting his move to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for rising  inflation  in the United States as ""utter nonsense."" During a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s virtual address to Congress, McConnell, R-Ky., maintained the importance of reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank, and said he has been calling for the Biden administration, since December, to ""expedite shipments of lethal aid and aircraft and tank-weapons."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES   McConnell, in a swipe at the Biden administration, said ""efforts to transfer the weapons moved at the speed of bureaucracy."" Criticizing the administration, McConnell said the White House has ""insisted its hesitation and restraint was aimed at avoiding escalation."" ""But at every step, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has escalated now three weeks and Putin's invasion, the reality, on the ground is evolving,"" McConnell said, claiming it is ""harder now than it would have been a few months ago to keep the pipeline of weapons supplies and intelligence for Ukraine's brave assistance open.""

McConnell called on Biden to ""deploy more U.S. forces to reinforce NATO's eastern flank and use the new drawdown and loan guarantee authorities to help harden the defenses of our front-line allies and partners."" ""Many of these partners are generously helping Ukraine, and we should help them backfill their inventories with more modern American capabilities that will improve NATO's interoperability and bolster deterrence,"" McConnell said.

       (Drew Angerer, Pool via AP) McConnell's comments came after Zelenskyy pleaded with the United States to ""do more"" by implementing a no-fly zone, providing additional aircraft and air defense systems, and creating a new security alliance. The White House has maintained that the creation of a no-fly zone would be viewed as ""escalatory"" and ""could prompt a war with Russia.""  Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so it is not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked, all member countries will take action to assist. Biden, on Wednesday afternoon, is expected to make remarks at the White House to announce an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine – on top of the $200 million in funding that was announced Saturday.  The new funding brings the United States' total assistance to Ukraine to over $1 billion in the span of just a few days – and the total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to over $1.2 billion within the past year.  UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY ADDRESSES CONGRESS, INVOKES 9/11, PEARL HARBOR, MLK AS HE PLEADS FOR PIVOTAL AID Biden is set to travel to Brussels, Belgium, next week for a NATO summit, scheduled for March 24.  But McConnell called on Biden to expand his trip, and ""go beyond Brussels."" ""He should go to countries like Poland, Romania or Lithuania to meet with NATO eastern flank allies,"" McConnell said. ""And he should look beyond NATO to deepen our diplomatic and security cooperation with important American partners.""   Video Meanwhile, McConnell said that ""even with a literal land war in Europe, the Democrats' implosion is so painful that inflation, and not Ukraine, still tops the American people’s biggest list of concerns."" ""From the gas pump to the grocery store, to clothes, diapers and baby formula, to furniture and home essentials, to car repairs and car replacements – Democrats' policies have put working families on a treadmill where they have to run faster and faster every month, just to stay in place,"" McConnell said, citing ""spiking"" rent prices, increasing ""faster than they have since 1991,"" and grocery prices soaring ""faster than they have since 1980."" WHITE HOUSE INSISTS NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE 'COULD PROMPT A WAR WITH RUSSIA' ""Democrats have lost a shameless campaign to blame 12 months of inflation, not on 12 months of their bad policies, but instead on the last three-week crisis in Europe,"" McConnell continued. ""The White House informs us, quote, ‘Putin's price hike is the culprit.’"" ""Of course, that is utter nonsense,"" McConnell said. ""This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own the White House."" Biden, this week, said, again, that Putin and the COVID-19 pandemic are to blame for record-high inflation in the United States and maintained that rising prices have ""nothing to do"" with his administration’s policies. ""We know that families are still struggling with higher prices,"" Biden said. ""Let's be absolutely clear about why prices are high now or high for two reasons.""  The first, Biden said, is due to ""the way the global economy works."" ""A factory in Taiwan that makes computer chips shuts down to a COVID outbreak. It causes a ripple effect to slow down auto-manufacturing,"" Biden said. ""So, because of the pandemic, we had significant disruptions in the supply chain, and our supply chain is so important with so many materials that come from other places."" ""And now, a second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin,"" Biden said.  MCCARTHY SLAMS BIDEN FOR 'AMERICA-LAST ENERGY POLICIES' AS INFLATION HITS NEW 40-YEAR HIGH IN FEBRUARY ""We've seen the price of gas go up over a dollar just since he put his troops on the border on the border of Ukraine — they went up a dollar and five cents,"" Biden said. ""Big part of that reason is Putin began amassing troops along the border and then crossed. And guess what? The world took notice,"" Biden said. ""The market anticipated, prices went up, and then Putin invaded."" He added: ""Make no mistake, the current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin – it has nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan."" NSA SULLIVAN CALLS ON RUSSIAN OFFICIAL TO 'STOP ATTACKING' UKRAINE, WARNS AGAINST USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS Biden said that ""rescuing our economy didn’t cause this problem,"" but he vowed to ""fix it."" Meanwhile,  inflation hit a fresh 40-year high  in February. The  consumer price index  climbed 7.9% on an annual basis, according to data released on Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Month over month, according to the data, inflation rose 0.8%. The year-over-year reading is in line with estimates and compares with an annual 7.5% jump in January, marking the fastest increase since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.6%. Gas jumped 6.6% in February and accounted for almost a third of price hikes, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. Food prices, in comparison, rose by 1%. The February data were recorded before the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has pushed prices at the pump to $4.31 as of today, according to AAA, a record high.  Biden last week announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the ""main artery"" of Russia's economy amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. Biden warned that the ban would cost American families. Russian oil exports account for about one-third  of Europe’s oil imports , but Russian exports are just under 10% of U.S. overall imports.
