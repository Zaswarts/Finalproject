# Final project
Final project for my data science course

So, when I started this project, I had an ambitious thought to compare 3 different countries news outlets.  By considering the percentage of categories(genres) of news and then doing a sentiment analysis on the content of articles to see if the old adage “All news is bad news.” was true.  Completely new to the world of web scraping and crawlers I completely underestimated how much I would have to learn and accomplish over the time given.  As you can probably already see 

 

It didn’t happen... 

 

I got through 1 of the 9 websites I had planned to scrape after coding and debugging the crawlers. Which honestly, I still feel accomplished about.  Having to learn how to use multiple new modules and learning how to read and understand a whole other coding language (HTML) is a lot to take on.  I’ve learned a lot but still need to learn much more about CSS and Xpath selectors and how to ascertain what are the correct paths to use to scrape the data properly.   I was able to get the News category, Headline, and the article itself after much trial and error and a little help from stack overflow.  Which I have included in the folder Original Project. 

 

Now we PIVOT! 

 

After figuring out that I most certainly wouldn’t be able to complete my original project on time I looked for something else that would retain the NLP and news focus of the prior project I came upon a medium article that caught my eye. I used this as a base for the Pivot part of my project and decided to show how fast news headlines change (from Covid-19 to the Russian invasion of Ukraine). With Just a couple months between the two news outlets CNN and Fox news.  Also, to show the lexical differences between the two outlets while discussing the same topics. It introduced me to using selenium in web scraping, wordcloud style visualization, Tableau animations, and Lexical Analysis.  I made changes to the source code for things that didn’t work right and made it my own, in a sense.  There is still plenty to do and explore within that source code and I plan on doing just that. 

 

In conclusion.  Don’t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone and try something that you know next to nothing about.  Always have a backup plan and don’t be afraid to piece together something from different source code.  The resources are out there for you to use and grow as a data scientist, who knows maybe you will find a way to do something that no one has seen yet. 

 

As Mr. Reatano says “This project is a journey.” and that it was.
