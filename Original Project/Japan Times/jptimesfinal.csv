			,Bloomberg,The yen’s plunge to a five-year low shows no signs of easing as surging commodity prices have worsened the outlook for Japan’s trade balance and put pressure on the currency’s haven credentials.,The nation is a net importer of a long list of raw materials from crude oil and grains to metals, exposing it to higher costs as prices of all these have risen due to sanctions imposed on Russia over its ,. Japan posted its sixth straight monthly trade deficit in January, with the shortfall climbing to an eight-year high of ¥2.2 trillion ($18.7 billion). February numbers are due Wednesday.,
,The yen’s decline this year is even more striking given that it typically benefits in times of risk aversion. The currency has dropped against more than half of its Group of 10 peers in the past month even as the conflict in Ukraine set off a flight to safety among global investors.,""Japan relies on importing all these commodities, which are essential,” said Daisaku Ueno, chief currency strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo. ""As a fallout from the war in Ukraine, Japan is facing increased demand for dollars that’s irrelevant of risk sentiment.”,The yen is likely to drop a further 1% to 118.66 per dollar in coming months, Ueno said. That would match one of its most significant previous lows set in December 2016.,The currency headed for a sixth straight day of losses on Monday, sliding as much as half a percent to 117.88, the weakest level since January 2017.,""Momentum for dollar-yen is clearly to the upside after failing to strengthen below 114, and it can rise to 118.66 in the next one-or-two months,” said Yukio Ishizuki, a senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. in Tokyo. ""It’s difficult to see sanctions on Russia eased and commodities prices are likely to stay elevated, which puts yen at the mercy of ballooning trade deficits.”,The yen usually benefits during times of risk aversion as speculators cut back the short positions that they have built up during more positive periods. This time round though the dynamics are playing out differently.,Ironically leveraged funds started trimming their net short yen positions at exactly the wrong time, with the currency now falling to its lowest level against the greenback in more than five years.,CFTC data show short-term funds have pared their net short yen positions for the last three weeks through March 8 by 21,375 contracts to 28,343. At the end of the first week of cutting their position, on Feb. 22, dollar-yen was holding above support at its 100-DMA. Since then, not only has the pair dipped below that day’s level only once, it has rallied nearly 3% on the back of rising U.S. yields.,While the reduction in shorts may keep the yen in a range between 110 and 116 per dollar until the Ukraine situation stabilizes, the currency’s long-term direction is down and it will probably test around 120 by year-end, said Juntaro Morimoto, a currency analyst at Sony Financial Holdings Inc. in Tokyo.,""The divergence in monetary policy is putting upward pressure on the dollar-yen as a widening yield differentials will remove any yen appreciation factors after uncertainty over Ukraine clears up,” he said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS, AFP-JIJI,Dark Western “The Power of the Dog” scooped the top two honors at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, winning best film and director for Jane Campion, while sci-fi epic “Dune” picked up the most prizes.,Japanese director , snagged the award for best film not in the English language for , at the London-based event, giving the slow-burning drama an outside chance of going one better at the Oscars on March 28.,
,“That’s the power of film, they go beyond language, they go beyond borders,” Hamaguchi said as he accepted the prize. “That really is the power of film.”,New Zealand filmmaker Campion wrapped up a successful weekend for her comeback feature film, after winning the top honors at the Directors Guild of America awards in Beverly Hills the day before.,Based on the 1967 novel by Thomas Savage, the critically-acclaimed movie set on a 1920s Montana ranch marks the return of Oscar winner Campion to feature films since 2009’s “Bright Star.”,“Jane … you are a visionary whose trail blazed through the last 30 years of cinema with stories about the silenced, the under-represented and the misunderstood,” producer Tanya Seghatchian said as she accepted the award on behalf of Campion, who was absent. “You’ve inspired legions of women to find their voices. We’re here because of you.”,Campion later briefly appeared via a video call on the phone of one of the film’s producers during the winners’ press conference, and said she was “overwhelmed.”,Hosted by Australian actress and comedian Rebel Wilson, this year’s ceremony, known as the BAFTAs (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) returned as a usual glitzy red carpet event at London’s Royal Albert Hall, following a virtual event last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,There were references to the war in Ukraine, with some nominees wearing ribbons and badges in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag or speaking about the crisis on the red carpet and on stage.,“Dune,” a mammoth adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, had lead nominations with 11 nods, mainly in the creative and technical categories. It won five awards.,“Belfast,” Kenneth Brannagh’s semi-autobiographical black and white comedy drama set at the onset of Northern Ireland’s three decades of conflict, won outstanding British film.,Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” remake won two awards, including best supporting actress for Ariana DeBose.,Fresh from his win at the Screen Actors Guild awards, Troy Katsur, who is deaf, won supporting actor for “CODA,” a coming-of-age story about the only hearing member of a deaf family.,“This is a historic moment because it’s been an extremely long time for folks to really accept a different perspective of the deaf community and deaf actors,” Kotsur said on the red carpet via an interpreter. “Finally they look at me not as a deaf person, but as an artist and an actor who happens to be deaf.”,An absent Will Smith won the leading actor award for playing the father of tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams in “King Richard,” while Joanna Scanlan won leading actress for portraying a widow who discovers her late husband’s devastating secret in “After Love.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Japan has long had a love affair with the PET bottle — both full and empty.,The clear, strong and lightweight plastic outperformed aluminum, steel and glass to hold 76% of all nonalcoholic drinks in the country in 2020, according to the Japan Soft Drinks Association (JSDA). And, thanks to a proactive industry, stringent laws and compliant consumers, Japan was among the top countries in the world for PET bottle collection in 2021, at 93%, and recycling, at 89%, according to the Council for PET Bottle Recycling.,
,Still, growing environmental awareness has put the consumption of single-use plastic under a harsh spotlight. Even with steps to reduce the volume of fossil fuel-derived PET required for new bottles, there remain calls for more to be done.,Forty years on since the introduction of this packaging for soft drinks, how and why has PET bottle consumption and processing in Japan changed and what does the future hold?,
,
,Patented in 1973, the PET bottle was invented by Nathaniel Wyeth, an American mechanical engineer and inventor. Building on the work of colleagues who created PET in 1941, Wyeth’s variant of polyethylene terephthalate could withstand the pressure of carbonated liquids while still being lighter than glass and virtually unbreakable.,Japan first adopted the material in 1977 for packaging soy sauce until a revision to the container and packaging standards in the Food Sanitation Act allowed its use to be expanded to beverages in February 1982. In the same year, the first heat-resistant PET bottle was developed in Japan and the Japan PET Bottle Association was established.,At first, liquids were limited to fruit juice, closely followed by varieties of tea. Use for liquor, of which most was ,, was permitted in 1985.,Bottle size was restricted by the industry to 1 liter or more to curb waste (as bottles were largely incinerated in those days) but consumer demand for smaller containers and the introduction of PET bottle recycling in the 1990s ushered in the release of 500-milliliter bottles in 1996.,As part of efforts to support the recycling process, beverage and PET bottle manufacturing companies published Industry Voluntary Design Guidelines in 1992. Under the recommendations, bottles were to be clear and made solely of PET, with no direct printing on them; caps were to be made only of plastic and labels were to be easily removable by hand.,
,
,Shunichi Nasu, general manager of the business planning division at the JSDA, says the “foresight” and “great decisions” of the industry leaders who made those guidelines has helped Japan far exceed the PET bottle recycling rate of the European Union (58%) and the United States (28%).,However, the JSDA, whose industry members collaborate on common, noncompetitive issues such as recycling, wants to do more. It is working toward 100% collection, which would increase the recycling rate even further. One key way to achieve this is by reducing contamination of bottles before collection.,Of the 665,000 tons of PET bottles collected in 2019, 46% were picked up by municipalities and 54% came from the “business route,” which includes factories, offices, schools and recycling boxes at vending machines.,
,
,Today, PET from homes is predominantly clean (rinsed, with cap and label removed), unlike many collections from the business route. Large organizations also perform well, while buildings shared by numerous small and midsized enterprises tend to have less sorted recycling, says Nasu. Street collections fare worst.,In 2020, more than 30% of the content in recycling boxes by vending machines in the Tokyo area were non-PET, namely tobacco packaging (28%), alcohol containers (22%) and daily living waste (19%).,The problem also extends to the rest of Japan. According to Miho Hayashi of the Kanagawa Prefecture-based IGES Centre Collaborating with UNEP on Environmental Technologies, the disposal of non-PET waste in bins located next to vending machines is “a challenge for increasing recycling” that has prompted many companies to consider “how to modify the design of such bins so that only PET bottles can be disposed of.”,Contamination renders PET bottle recycling expensive and difficult at best, and inefficient or impossible at worst. An estimated 30% of the PET bottles collected in Japan are exported, largely because they are too dirty to be used, Nasu says. If contaminants can be reduced or removed from bottles collected through the business route, there is a greater chance that more PET recycling can be done domestically.,Collecting as much clean PET as possible is vital to promote “bottle-to-bottle” recycling and make it more competitive, says Hayashi. This form of horizontal recycling “can reduce or even avoid the use of virgin resin, a material derived from fossil fuels” by using “material and chemical recycling to allow PET bottles to be reborn as new PET bottles.” The closed loop results in a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide compared to creating new PET from fossil-based resources.,At present, only 15.7% of PET bottles in Japan are produced by horizontal recycling. Most undergo downcycling, as their constituent materials are transformed into textiles or low-quality plastics. Although better than not recycling, once this process begins, recycling becomes harder and, ultimately, no longer possible.,
,
,Recognizing these limitations, the JSDA declared in April 2021 that its members would achieve 50% bottle-to-bottle recycling by 2030. Although Nasu admits “there is a big journey ahead,” he is confident the promise of “clean” PET will convince consumers to support the cause.,The JSDA is trialing a new kind of recycling box by vending machines. It features an enforced lid to make it difficult to open by consumers and a smaller, less visible opening to prevent it being used for trash. In line with education efforts, the box is orange — the same color as the branding for the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities — and labels convey key messages detailing the box’s target refuse.,
,
,Several large Japanese soft drink manufacturers are also appealing to consumers to dispose of PET bottles at work, in train stations and on the street as carefully as they do at home.,In December 2020, Ito-en placed what it called a “Tsubuseru Recycling Box” in Shibuya to raise awareness of its bottle-to-bottle efforts. The transparent bin was fitted with technology to compress each PET bottle in 20 seconds. In an on-site survey, less than half of passersby said they understood the meaning of bottle-to-bottle recycling.,“Among those who throw away non-PET in recycling boxes, many think they are doing right by not littering, so we wanted to see if bottle-to-bottle awareness would change their view,” says company spokesperson Aichiro Yamaguchi. “Through our efforts we were able to confirm that the box is interesting and leads to proper sorting and understanding.”,Similarly, the Kirin Group and Lawson teamed up in 2021 to promote bottle-to-bottle recycling by placing new PET bottle collection machines outside Lawson stores. On the outer panel, users were asked to wash their bottles and remove labels and caps before feeding them into the machine to be crushed. As an incentive, users received one Lawson Ponta point for every five bottles inserted. If the data is promising, the pair plan to roll out the scheme to more stores this year.,Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Suntory says its new logo, launched this month, , (“Bottles are resources! Towards a Sustainable Bottle”), will strengthen its communication to consumers on horizontal recycling. The company recorded a bottle-to-bottle recycling rate of 37% in 2021 and aims to use recycled PET materials for more than half of its total plastic bottle weight in Japan by 2025.,
,
,With the drive to gather more clean PET, Hideo Akabane, vice-chief secretariat of The Council for PET Bottle Recycling, says “further significant growth can be expected (in bottle-to-bottle recycling) as multiple new production plants will be launched in the future.”,Companies are also exploring new ways to reduce the amount of PET required to make bottles. Since these efforts began in 2004, manufacturers have reduced the weight of an average PET bottle by 25%, equating to savings of 185,200 tons in 2019, according to The Council for PET Bottle Recycling.,Suntory claims its 550-milliliter Tennensui water bottle is the lightest in Japan at a mere 11.9 grams. It uses 30% plant-based materials, which means 40% fewer petroleum-derived ingredients are used per bottle. Asahi Soft Drinks’ Mitsuya Cider bottles are also 27% lighter than they were in 2004.,Recently developed technologies utilizing nitrogen and pressurization have also led to more lightweight, heat-resistant bottles.,
,
,Ensuring PET bottles keep their shape and that any carbonated drink inside has an adequate shelf life are the biggest obstacles to making bottles lighter, according to Nasu.,“We can’t reduce the amount of plastic used as quickly as we have done in the past 20 years, and we’re now in a place where it’s difficult to reduce more, but we’re still looking for opportunities,” he says.,One new growth area for plastic reduction is in online bulk sales of soft drinks. Following an amendment to the law in 2020, companies are able to forgo labels on individual PET bottles provided the necessary product information is printed on the box, thereby placing consumers one step closer to “clean” PET.,Under this system, Asahi Soft Drinks offers label-free bottled water, ready-to- drink tea and yogurt beverages, while Coca-Cola Co.’s I Lohas bottle sports an embossed logo.,The pandemic-induced uptick in online shopping is expected to stimulate ongoing demand, according to GlobalData’s Market Pulse Survey, which found almost one-third of consumers intend to maintain or increase their bulk soft drink purchasing habits.,
,
,The future offers further opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of the PET bottle. The Coca-Cola Co. offered a taste in October 2021 with the launch of its first bottle made entirely from plant-based packaging. The technology used to create the PlantBottle “signals a step-change in the commercial viability of the biomaterial,” according to a company statement.,Nevertheless, grassroots campaigns to reduce or eliminate PET bottle usage and promote more sustainable lifestyles have sprung up in Japan in recent years. Nonprofit organization Mymizu, for example, provides a water refill app that allows users to access free water on the go — from shops, cafes and other sites — so they don’t need to buy bottled water.,Despite the growing number of alternatives, the soft drinks industry remains confident that PET will continue to be Japan’s container of choice for years to come.,“We gave consumers options — cans, glass, PET — and they liked PET, so our responsibility is to provide a continuous supply,” says Nasu, who touts the JSDA’s stance that PET bottles can do more good than harm in the long run. “I want a future where consumers think empty PET bottles are not garbage, but resources to help the Earth.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,For years, bitcoin buffs who were questioned by skeptics about the value of the cryptocurrency would respond by saying: Just wait.,Wait until inflation hits, and people look to park their savings in a stable digital asset that won’t lose its value. Wait until war breaks out, and authoritarians start seizing assets and imposing capital controls on their citizens. Wait until big banks and tech companies start censoring dissidents for their political views. Then you’ll see why we need a stateless, decentralized, anonymous digital currency.,
,More than most cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was seen by many of its libertarian-leaning fans as a kind of doomsday insurance, a form of “digital gold” that would be a source of stability as the world grew more chaotic and unpredictable.,Well, chaos is here. In the United States, inflation is rising at the fastest pace in decades, and the VIX — the so-called fear index used by Wall Street to measure expected volatility in the stock market — has risen more than 80% this year. Last month, Canada’s government responded to the threat of a protest convoy of anti-vaccine truckers by threatening to freeze their bank accounts, drawing calls for a type of money that isn’t subject to government seizures. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was met with brutal sanctions that have tanked the ruble and devastated the Russian economy, and many U.S. companies have pulled out of Russia, making it nearly impossible for its citizens to access their bank accounts, use credit cards or even post on social media.,In other words, this is a perfect storm of economic and geopolitical events that should, theoretically, be great for bitcoin.,But bitcoin hasn’t boomed. In fact, even as Wall Street analysts contemplate the possibility of nuclear Armageddon, crypto prices have fallen steadily. Bitcoin prices are down 10% in the past month, and Ether, the second most popular crypto coin, is down roughly 15%.,Day-to-day usage of cryptocurrencies isn’t picking up the way you’d expect, either. Bitcoin trading volume rose after Russia invaded Ukraine, but it has remained relatively flat since, suggesting that people aren’t rushing to trade their rubles and hryvnia (Ukraine’s currency) for digital currencies. Russian oligarchs don’t appear to be using crypto to evade sanctions en masse, either, despite initial fears that they might.,Granted, crypto has not been totally absent from these events. In Canada, some truckers raised money through crypto donations (while others had their crypto wallets seized as part of the crackdown), and Ukraine’s government has reportedly raised nearly $100 million in crypto donations. And it’s still too early to say, with certainty, that crypto won’t be useful in later stages of the Russian conflict.,But bitcoin doesn’t seem to be playing a central role in our global unraveling so far. Which raises the obvious question: Why not?,One possibility is that crypto is still too confusing and too difficult for normal people to use, especially during a war. Internet access is spotty in many parts of Ukraine, and reports have suggested that even the country’s elites are struggling to convert their assets into crypto.,Another possibility, popular among skeptics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is that bitcoin is still too volatile to be useful as a hedge against economic and political instability.,“The bitcoin and crypto communities have been selling a false narrative all these years that bitcoin is supposed to be a safe haven from the traditional financial markets,” said Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association, a cryptocurrency trade group. (His group promotes a bitcoin spinoff, Bitcoin SV, that sees itself as a more useful version of the cryptocurrency.),Bitcoin is doomed, Nguyen argues, because it can be slow and expensive to process transactions, making it less useful for paying for things. “And so a lot of bitcoin supporters have had to come up with this argument that it’s meant to be a reserve asset,” he said.,Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, floated a different theory. Bitcoin’s earliest and most vocal adopters, he said, tended to be libertarians who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of insurance policy against hyperinflation and government corruption. But the more recent price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments and cared less about their political implications.,“There’s a tremendous amount of rhetoric around bitcoin in particular that suggests that it’s predominantly a means of escaping from the government-issued fiat currency system,” he said. “And yet most of the activity, according to basically every rigorous study that’s been done, is predominantly people speculating.”,Another possible explanation for bitcoin’s underperformance, which was floated by Joe Weisenthal at Bloomberg, is that chaos cuts both ways and that the same events that could be seen as “good for bitcoin” in the short term — inflation, sanctions, geopolitical conflict — could also be bad for bitcoin over the long term, since they could draw the attention of regulators.,“To whatever extent the Canadian trucker story would be seen as bullish for bitcoin (because it got people thinking about ways of making payments without regulated entities) it’s also bearish for bitcoin (because it caught the attention of state actors who wanted to push back against such payments),” he wrote.,There are other explanations out there, too. Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive of crypto exchange FTX, said on Twitter that while he thought bitcoin would “do better” in a less stable political and economic environment, he guessed that the discrepancy was partially related to the media’s negative coverage of crypto.,“Headlines have been largely negative independent of actual content the last month in a reaction to statements from the industry, which I think has posed significant headwinds,” he wrote.,But perhaps the most interesting view of crypto’s usefulness during unstable times comes straight from Ukraine’s government.,On Tuesday, I posed a question about crypto to Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. Since the Russian invasion, Bornyakov and his team — led by the country’s digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov — have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for Ukraine’s army. Tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses, and the money has been used to buy military supplies, including bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles.,Bornyakov, who was speaking from an undisclosed location in Ukraine on a videoconference hosted by artificial intelligence company Collective[i], said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed.,“In a situation like this, where the national bank is not fully operating, crypto is helping to perform fast transfers, to make it very quick and get results almost immediately,” he said.,But Bornyakov seemed wary of overstating crypto’s importance to the Ukrainian cause.,“I don’t think crypto is playing a major part,” Bornyakov said. “But its role is essential in this conflict in terms of helping our army.”,

			,AFP-jiji,Russians were relishing their final moments scrolling through Instagram on Sunday, while bloggers and small businesses that rely heavily on the platform scrambled to lure followers elsewhere online.,Moscow announced this week that access to the social network would cease, accusing Instagram’s parent company Meta of turning a blind eye to calls for violence against Russians.,
,In a farewell post, reality TV star Olga Buzova — who has racked up the second-largest audience in Russia with 23 million followers — was in despair and disbelief.,“Right now, I’m writing this post and crying,” she wrote, annotating the text with a crying emoji. “I hope this isn’t true.”,Fashion blogger Karina Nigay, who meanwhile boasts nearly 3 million followers, was still processing the fact of the looming ban.,“I’m in a state of resentment and nowhere near a state of acceptance,” she said.,The move comes as part of long-running efforts by President Vladimir Putin to rein in control of what Russians can and cannot access on the internet.,These efforts have quickened to a dizzying pace since he announced Russia’s sweeping military incursion in Ukraine and as authorities work to control how the conflict is seen at home.,Russia’s media regulator Roskomnadzor said this week that Instagram was being taken down for allowing posts urging violence against Russians.,But the official website Gosuslugi, which hosts government services, said Instagram would be pulled beginning March 14 citing Russians’ “psychological health” and efforts to protect children from “bullying and insults.”,Gosuslugi also recommended that Russians return to homegrown platforms that were abandoned as Instagram and Faceook’s popularity ballooned.,
,Many bloggers said on Instagram they would pivot to VK, Russia’s equivalent of Facebook.,It is closest among Russian social media platforms to Instagram in its features but has also been accused of cozying up to authorities.,Russians have also been turning to Telegram, a network already hugely popular in Russia and across former Soviet countries, which Moscow several years ago tried — and ultimately failed — to block.,The app was created to be a messaging service but also hosts channels where users can post photos and videos with accompanying texts.,Forty-one-year-old painter Alexei Garkusha said in Saint Petersburg that he would be among those turning to Telegram.,It’s “more interesting,” he said, sounding less concerned about Instagram’s fate.,“If they shut it down, they shut it down!” Garkusha shrugged.,In farewell posts, bloggers lamented the need to rebuild their following and businesses, at a time when the economy is struggling under Western sanctions.,“Many, ironically, say that bloggers will finally get over their dependency on easy money,” said Alexandra Mitroshina, a popular user known for instructing others how to monetize their following.,“But don’t forget that half of our small and medium businesses are linked to Instagram and Whatsapp,” she told her 2 million followers.,For many small Russian businesses, Instagram was a primary platform for advertising, processing sales and communicating with clients.,But former reality TV star, Buzova, was among those optimistic her work could continue on other platforms and urged followers to join her on VK.,“Of course it will be difficult and unusual but we are strong together,” she wrote.,Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri has said the platform has 80 million users in Russia.,On the streets of Russia’s former, imperial capital, Saint Petersburg, some people said the ban was a pity, but was not the end of the world.,“I don’t think anything globally catastrophic will happen,” said Yelena Teleginskaya, 31.,Others were pleased to see the back of it, like engineer Nikolay Yeremenko, 45.,“If they closed it, it’s for the best. We’ll live without it.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bloomberg,China placed the 17.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen into lockdown for at least a week, seeking to halt a growing COVID-19 outbreak with a move that could cause disruption and production delays in the key technology hub and port.,The lockdown, which came after virus cases doubled nationwide to nearly 3,400, will be accompanied by three rounds of city-wide mass testing, according to a government notice. The measure, announced Sunday, followed earlier restrictions placed on Shenzhen’s central business district, and will last until March 20.,
,All bus and subway systems were shut, and businesses, except those providing essential services, have been closed. Employees were told to work from home if they can. Residents will be barred from leaving the city except in limited situations.,Shenzhen is home to the headquarters of tech giants Huawei Technologies Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., as well as the key manufacturing facility of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. — Apple Inc.’s main maker of the iPhone and other products. It is also one of China’s busiest ports.,The surge in infections in the city is thought to be linked to an ,, where about 300,000 people are currently in isolation or under home quarantine. A , has also seen most schools returned to online learning and travel into the city restricted. Bus services from other provinces were halted, and China’s aviation regulator is in discussions with airlines about diverting all international flights into the financial center, Bloomberg News reported Friday.,Growing clusters spawned by the highly infectious omicron variant in China’s most developed large cities and economic powerhouses have turned into an unprecedented challenge for the country’s “COVID zero” strategy.,The policy, which saw China virus free for long periods and with one of the lowest death rates among major economies, is leaving the country increasingly isolated as other parts of the world open up and start to live with the virus. Until now, officials had largely resisted more hardcore measures such as lockdowns in China’s biggest cities and relied more on targeted responses, only to see omicron continue to spread.,
,COVID zero tactics have led to disruption in other cities, with multiple rounds of mass testing in Tianjin in January halting production at a Toyota Motor Corp. plant and other factories there for more than a week. The approach will make it harder for Beijing to hit its economic growth target in 2022, as the costs of the measures rise, Nomura Holdings Inc. says. Still, China reiterated its commitment to COVID zero on Friday, with top health official Ma Xiaowei saying strict controls needed to be kept in place and that officials should avoid “war-weariness” in their work.,Changchun, a city of some 9 million people in China’s northeast, was locked down on Friday, with residents there also to be mass tested. Reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, authorities are moving quickly to build makeshift hospitals there and in the eastern port city of Qingdao. China isolates all positive virus cases, regardless of severity, to prevent spread.,
,
,The COVID-19 surge in Hong Kong has provided an unprecedented challenge to Beijing, with the city’s tight border controls and weeks-long quarantines no match for omicron once it entered the city. Thousands of people left the Asian financial hub to return to the mainland, with Shenzhen and Shanghai some of the busiest entry ports.,Shanghai Disneyland will operate at controlled capacity and will require visitors to present negative COVID-19 test results from within 24 hours of entering the amusement park.,Hong Kong’s health system and morgues have been under pressure from the record outbreak that’s pushed its death rate to one of the highest in the world. While the virus case count in the city appears to have plateaued over the past week, fatalities have risen, especially among the elderly, which had some of the lowest vaccination rates despite their greater vulnerability.,The Hong Kong government is still formulating plans for the mandatory testing of all its residents, including timing and how they’ll ensure essential operations can continue if movement restrictions were to be imposed, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Wednesday. For now, authorities will focus on vaccinating older people living at care facilities — which are seeing a surge in fatalities — and increase the number of hospital beds to treat patients, she has said.,Also an adherent of COVID zero, Hong Kong has laid the limits of the strategy bare with authorities scrambling once omicron got through the tough border defenses. There seems to have been little planning for if the virus flared meaningfully in the city, resulting in scenes eerily similar to those seen in the early days of the pandemic in parts of Italy and the U.S. Hong Kong’s density and political climate makes it difficult to lock down, and despite pressure from Beijing officials have so far resisted calling one.,While China is publicly still committed to eliminating COVID-19, there are signs the country’s health officials and experts are at least considering how they may exit the approach and live with the virus as endemic.,China approved the antiviral pill Paxlovid developed by Pfizer Inc. last month, a move seen by many as evidence of that planning. The introduction of rapid antigen tests on Friday may also be a sign, with other countries shifting toward use of at-home tests when their lab testing systems were overwhelmed by broader circulation of the virus.,That said, any shift will be slow and unlikely to occur before 2023, given the need for stability in a politically important year for President Xi Jinping, people familiar with China’s thinking have told Bloomberg.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

National,,Japan to discuss creating new police unit to guard nuclear plants,"

			,staff writer,Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday that the government will consider establishing a new police unit in charge of protecting the nation’s nuclear power plants.,""Now that the public is becoming increasingly concerned about nuclear power plant safety, I would like to discuss the possibility of deploying a dedicated nuclear power plant special security force across the nation,” Kishida said during an Upper House Budget Committee meeting.,
,The prime minister's remark comes in the wake of Russia’s attack in early March on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in which Russian forces fired heavy weapons in the direction of the plant’s reactors. In addition to occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian troops also control the Chernyobyl plant, which has been nonoperational since a 1986 accident resulted in a core meltdown. A third Ukrainian plant, Yuzhnoukrainsk, is also at risk, with reports last week indicating that Russian troops were about 30 kilometers away.,Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian nuclear power plants prompted reflection in Japan about the vulnerability of its own nuclear power fleet. On Tuesday, Fukui Gov. Tatsuji Sugimoto called for the deployment of the Self-Defense Forces near the prefecture’s 15 reactors, including both those that are operational and those scheduled for or undergoing decommissioning.,Fukui Prefecture has the largest number of nuclear reactors in the country.,“Reactors should never be attacked, but to prepare for such a contingency, I urge the Defense Ministry to set up SDF bases to halt such attacks,” Sugimoto said when presenting his request to Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi.,Kishida, however, indicated that he wants to discuss strengthening nuclear power plant security through the expansion of the specialized police unit that guards the Fukui plants, not the SDF. In Fukui, the Nuclear Facility Security Unit is exclusively tasked with guarding nuclear power plants.,
,
,At Monday’s Upper House budget meeting, Kenichi Sakurazawa, director general of the National Police Agency's Security Bureau, said it was his intention to strengthen security at nuclear power plants throughout Japan following the Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia.,Sakurazawa said that the current security system in Fukui consists of an armed security force on alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. He explained that special security units equipped with automatic rifles and specialized vehicles are also stationed at nuclear power plants outside Fukui.,Opposition parties, however, are calling for a fixed unit to be established, as the current system means riot police members are transferred out on a rotating basis for a fixed term.,The vulnerability of nuclear reactors to attack has long been a concern in the prefectures that host them. In December, a nationwide association of local towns and villages hosting nuclear power plants issued a call for a legal structure establishing no-fly zones over nuclear power plants and for setting a minimum altitude for flying in their vicinity.,The association also sought stronger cooperation between the SDF, police, the Japan Coast Guard and related authorities to strengthen the defense of nuclear plants from missile attacks and terrorists.,That request came after the National Governors’ Association met in June and issued a similar call for no-fly zones above the plants and a minimum altitude for aircraft in a plant’s vicinity.,
,
,On March 4, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said that if a nuclear power plant in Japan is attacked by a missile from another country, it will be intercepted by missiles.,""We will respond with a multilayered defense that combines an intercept at the upper level by the Maritime Self-Defense Force's SM3-equipped Aegis ships and an intercept at the lower level by the Air Self-Defense Force's PAC-3 missiles,"" he said, referring to surface-to-air missile systems.,Shigeru Handa, a defense writer and adjunct professor at Dokkyo University and Hosei University, said Matsuno’s answer was limited to what is possible in terms of defense when Aegis destroyers and PAC-3 missiles are pre-deployed in case of an attack on a nuclear power plant.,“Constitutionally, there is no problem with the SDF guarding nuclear power plants. However, the Self-Defense Forces Law limits the scope of SDF protection to U.S. military facilities and SDF facilities. Revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law is necessary to protect nuclear power plants,” he said.,As of Feb. 28, Japan had 60 nuclear power plants, spread across 13 of the nation's 47 prefecture, Of those, 24 were being decommissioned, 10 were officially in operation and seven had been approved for restart. Another 10 were undergoing safety inspections, and the nine remaining reactors had not applied for a restart.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is set to begin internal discussions on nuclear deterrence, taking up the controversial issue of nuclear weapons-sharing with the United States despite the government’s opposition to the idea, party lawmakers said Monday.,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its threat of using nuclear weapons have prompted calls from conservative party members, including former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, for ,.,
,The LDP’s panel on national security will hear expert opinions on U.S. and European nuclear deterrence strategies on Wednesday and exchange views, the party sources said.,Japan, which suffered the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, upholds the three principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing nuclear weapons on its soil. For years, it has relied on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for deterrence.,Designed to provide collective security for its members, NATO has nuclear sharing arrangements under which nonnuclear states host U.S. nuclear weapons for use in the event of a war.,A few days after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, , similar to NATO’s, without a “taboo.”,LDP policy chief Sanae Takaichi, who shares a hawkish stance on security with Abe, has said in the event of a contingency there should be an exception to the principle of “not allowing” nuclear weapons to be brought to Japan., that the government will start its own discussions about a potential nuclear sharing arrangement.,“Under the Japan-U.S. alliance, extended deterrence is working,” Kishida told a parliamentary session Monday, referring to Japan’s coverage by the U.S. nuclear umbrella and its military forces.,“The government is not planning to start discussions about nuclear sharing,” Kishida told the parliamentary session.,The latest push by conservative members of the LDP comes as Kishida, elected from a constituency in Hiroshima, has been pushing for a world free of nuclear weapons.,This year, Japan is planning to review its national security strategy adopted in 2013, when Abe was prime minister, and two other key documents on defense policy and equipment, to reflect the security environment around Japan, which Kishida has said has been getting “severer rapidly.”,Japan neighbors the nuclear states China and North Korea, whose nuclear and missile development remains a security concern. It also has a territorial dispute with Russia, another nuclear power.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Andy Murray expressed sympathy for Naomi Osaka after she was rattled by a heckler during her second-round loss on Saturday night at Indian Wells, but said unruly fans were an unfortunate part of sports.,Osaka was thrown off her game and began to cry after a person screamed, “Naomi, you suck!” early on in her eventual 6-0, 6-4 loss to Veronika Kudermetova.,
,After the match, Osaka spoke directly to the otherwise supportive crowd, saying the incident reminded her of the abuse Venus and Serena Williams received at the tournament in 2001, which led them to boycott the event for more than a decade.,“I’ve been heckled before and it didn’t really bother me,” Osaka said while holding back tears.,“But being heckled here. I’ve watched video of Venus and Serena get heckled here and if you’ve never watched it, you should watch it. And I don’t know why, but it went into my head and got replayed a lot.”,Osaka has been open about her struggles with mental wellness in the past and took a break from the sport following her upset loss at last year’s U.S. Open. She said she was in a great place emotionally coming into the tournament.,“It’s a difficult one,” Murray told reporters after his second-round loss on Sunday.,“I’ve often thought watching certain sports, I wouldn’t say I’ve often seen it loads in tennis … but if I watch a football or a soccer match and a player’s going to take throw-in or a corner kick and the crowd are just hurling insults at those individuals.,“I always think, how is that allowed? Like, you can’t do that,” he said, adding that such behavior would be unacceptable in public or any other workplace setting.,Murray said he had heard comments that were “not comfortable” when playing Davis Cup matches away from home in intense environments.,“Obviously I feel for Naomi, that it upset her a lot but yeah, it’s always been something that’s been part of sport, I guess, as well,” Murray said.,“So, you know, you have to, I guess, be prepared for that in some ways and be able to tolerate it because it does happen regularly across all sports.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady said Sunday he has changed his mind about retirement and will return to the NFL next season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.,Brady won six titles in 20 seasons with the New England Patriots then moved the Bucs in 2020 and led them to a Super Bowl title.,
,Tampa Bay lost to Los Angeles Rams, the eventual champions, in the playoffs in January and Brady announced his retirement last month.,Now the superstar quarterback, who turns 45 in August, says he wants at least one more chance at a championship.,“These past two months I have realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,” Brady said in a social media post. “That time will come. But it’s not now.,“I love my teammates and I love my supportive family. Without them, none of this is possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa.,“We have unfinished business.”,Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians was thrilled to welcome back Brady.,“Tom Brady loves to play football as much as anyone I’ve ever been around,” Arians said.,“He’s still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season. We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship.”,The Buccaneers simply posted a video of Brady on Twitter with the message: “He’s baaackkkk.”,The move comes in time for the team to adjust its free agency and draft plans to allow for the legendary signal caller to be back in uniform in the upcoming season.,“We’re thrilled that Tom has decided to come back this season,” Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said. “We said we would leave all options open for him should he reconsider his retirement and today’s announcement is something we have been preparing for in recent days.,“Bruce and I have had plenty of conversations with Tom recently that led us to believe there was a realistic chance he’d want to come back.,“Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level. With this decision now made, we will continue to move forward with our offseason plans to reload this roster for another championship run.”,Brady’s retirement lasted 40 days.,After speculation and reports Brady was going to hang up his cleats for the last time, he confirmed his retirement plans on Feb. 1, saying then he no longer felt he could commit to the sport.,“I have always believed the sport of football is an ‘all-in’ proposition — if a 100% competitive commitment isn’t there, you won’t succeed,” Brady wrote last month. “This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore.”,Brady, however, has found he’s ready to handle the hours of workouts in order to prepare for another title quest with the Buccaneers.,Among the most excited people to hear about Brady’s return was Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who had been the defender Brady victimized for his final career touchdown pass. Now other defensive backs could face that fate.,“THANK YOU,” Ramsey tweeted, “throw that last touchdown on somebody else.” Brady, a five-time Super Bowl MVP and three-time NFL MVP, already has a record 243 regular-season victories.,Brady will be rewriting the NFL record book every week. He already owns NFL career passing records with 7,263 completions on 11,317 attempts for 84,520 yards and 624 touchdowns.,The record he wants to erase the most is the one he holds as the oldest player to play in and win a Super Bowl, a stage he graced no fewer than 10 occasions.,His legacy includes a dramatic rally in the 2017 Super Bowl, when he led New England from a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons in the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.,Brady said last month he would recall his career as a “thrilling ride” and would “remember and cherish these memories and re-visit them often,” saying he felt like “the luckiest person in the world.”,For all the accolades Brady received from sports stars around the world, he actually took the advice of retired NBA icon Shaquille O’Neal, who tweeted last month that Brady should “Get your butt up and do one more year.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Eddie Jones insists England knows what it has to do in order to deny France a Grand Slam and finish the Six Nations with a flourish.,France has been the top team in this season’s Six Nations, but had to endure some nervous moments in a 13-9 win over Wales that kept it on track for an unbeaten campaign.,
,England, by contrast, will head to Paris following a record 32-15 loss at home against Ireland, a match that saw England’s Charlie Ewels sent off just 82 seconds into the action.,“We’ve beaten France in our last two games, so we’ve got a pretty good idea of how to play against them, but certainly Wales did really well on Friday night,” Jones said.,“Wales lost the kicking in the first 20 and to beat France you have to out-kick them. That’s the first thing.,“Then you have to out-fight them around the ruck, which Wales did.”,“Wales are a really hard, tough team and we have to replicate them at the ruck and keep (scrumhalf) Antoine Dupont quiet.”,France is now just 80 minutes away from its first Grand Slam since 2010 and Jones, who guided England to its most recent clean sweep in the tournament with a 31-21 victory in Paris six years ago, hopes the pressure surrounding Saturday’s match falls on Les Bleus.,“For them to be playing for the Grand Slam, I remember going there in 2016 going for the Grand Slam and because it’s such a huge thing in European rugby, it does become something in their head,” the Australian said.,“And the only way we can make that live in their head a bit more is to play with such an intensity, and such ferociousness that we put them on the back foot. I think we’ve seen it in a few games.,“Look, France are a good team, don’t get me wrong. But like any team — even the great All Black teams winning at 90%, on your day if you can get stuck into them physically, take away their strengths, you can cause them problems.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,Midfielder Daichi Kamada struck early in the second half Sunday to give Eintracht Frankfurt a 2-1 win against Bochum in the German top flight.,After scoring the winner in Frankfurt’s 2-1 Europa League victory over Real Betis midweek, Kamada once again made the vital breakthrough at Deutsche Bank Park against a Bochum side featuring his Samurai Blue teammate Takuma Asano.,
,Aiming to avoid an unwanted club record of five straight Bundesliga losses at home, manager Oliver Glasner’s side got off to a poor start, conceding a 19th-minute goal to Sebastian Polter from a set piece.,Asano missed a chance to make it 2-0 in the 24th minute when he was stopped one-on-one by Eintracht goalkeeper Kevin Trapp.,The Eagles drew level in the 46th minute through an own goal and pulled ahead six minutes later when Kamada tapped in following a flowing attacking move, bringing his season tally to three league goals and seven across all competitions.,Former Japan captain Makoto Hasebe did not come off the bench for Frankfurt.,In other Bundesliga action, Arminia Bielefeld’s Masaya Okugawa played the full 90 minutes in a 1-0 loss away to Borussia Dortmund.,In the Belgian top flight, Sint-Truiden’s Daichi Hayashi scored his sixth league goal of the season in a 1-0 win away to Genk.,Japanese-owned Sint-Truiden also started Japan’s Daniel Schmidt, Taichi Hara and Daiki Hashioka, while Samurai Blue winger Junya Ito played the full match for Genk.,In Austria’s top tier, Keito Nakamura scored a brace in LASK’s 6-0 drubbing of Tyrol.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,STAFF WRITER,Jordan Skopp, founder of the Foul Ball Safety Now! campaign that is urging MLB to add more protective netting at its games, was troubled by what he heard coming out of the negotiations between MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association during the league’s lockout.,Or rather, by what he did not hear.,
,There was plenty of talk about luxury taxes, service time and various other issues during the 99-day lockout, which ended Thursday afternoon. What Skopp and others in his campaign wanted to hear more about, however, was how MLB plans to protect its fans when the games begin in the major and minor leagues this spring.,Skopp, a Brooklyn-based realtor who roots for the New York Mets, has spent years advocating for MLB to install more netting in stadiums to protect fans from being seriously injured by foul balls hit into the stands. He has compiled research and tried to contact officials in baseball and also politicians regarding the issue. Skopp does not mince words and says it is unacceptable that MLB continues to run the risk of allowing its fans to be seriously injured by foul balls.,“You would think the Major League Baseball owners would say, ‘We cannot allow our employees to hit baseballs that crush the heads of baseball fans,'” Skopp told The Japan Times. “And on the other side, we have the players union, which represents the rank-and-file of all the players. Why would they allow their rank-and-file to go to work knowing that one of their members, sooner rather than later, could crush the head of a baseball fan?”,The issue of foul balls rocketing into the stands and causing injury is hardly a new one. Alan Fish, a 14-year-old boy, died after being struck by a foul ball while attending a game at Dodger Stadium in 1970. In 2018, 79-year-old Linda Goldbloom died as a result of being hit by a ball at the same venue.,There have been many other instances of fans being struck, though no reported deaths, in the years between those tragedies.,An investigation by U.S. television network NBC reported that over 800 fans were injured by balls during MLB games from 2012 to 2019. That report was focused only on MLB, meaning it did not account for incidents at minor league parks.,Skopp, in addition to petitioning MLB owners, says he has also taken the campaign to extend netting to stadium operators in the minors.,“I did a survey about a year ago at this time where I called 100 minor league ballparks,” he said. “I found out at least 42 still had no nets past dugouts. Where do things get crushed, including children? Past the end of dugouts.”,In 2019, MLB announced all 30 clubs would add more protective netting before the 2020 season. Skopp, however, is not yet satisfied with the league’s efforts.,He’s been working on getting the word out to the public whenever he can through his campaign.,He called a news conference early last year to allow victims to tell their stories and is working on a book about the issue in which he promises more testimonials.,“The evidence file is getting thicker by the day,” he said.,In June 2021, Skopp hired a plane to circle Dozer Park in Peoria, Illinois, while flying a banner that read in part, “Wake up Dozer! Nets!,” before a minor league game.,In addition to his frustration over MLB’s lack of action, Skopp also feels media members should speak up.,“Nobody has resigned from baseball or from baseball writing,” he said. “I’m not saying it’s just the writers. It could be the broadcasters, it’s the players, it’s the owners. Those are the four major groups that clearly should have expressed themselves enough.,“They probably have some conversation with their family on where to sit as the baseball players do.”,As Skopp followed the MLB negotiations, he lamented the lack of progress that has been made to protect fans since even before he took up the cause, but vowed to keep advocating, even if little was gained during baseball’s recent labor talks.,“Fifty-two years later, we’re still in the same place,” Skopp said. “Almost 52 years since Alan Fish.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

How-tos,,Are you headed for a Japanese quarantine? Here’s what you could be in for.,"

			,Contributing writer,No sooner did I get out of my seven-day stay at the “Hotel Quarantine” when ,.,Last week, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that the quarantine period will be reduced from seven to three days for those who have received their booster shots to protect themselves from COVID-19. And those individuals arriving from countries where the highly contagious omicron variant of the virus is “under control” will be exempted from quarantining at a designated facility altogether. That means you’ll be able to keep an eye on your health from the comfort of your own home.,
,Still, ,, chances are that you’ll need to follow some sort of regimen whether you’re a citizen returning from a business trip or an exchange student who has been waiting a long time to get here. Also, and I hate to be grim on this, we still can’t rule out the possibility of a new coronavirus variant making all of our lives miserable again.,Now that I’ve returned to the bustle of Tokyo, my own re-entry in mid-February is already starting to feel like a distant memory. However, I wanted to share the experience to let people know what they might be in for when they arrive.,One thing to remember, however: ,. I was lucky to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji every morning while I was holed up at a hotel near Haneda Airport, but some people may not have the same view.,In any case, here’s how my own stay panned out.,
,
,The preparation to get into Japan starts days before you even head to the airport you’re flying out of. There’s a string of different tasks that need to be checked off prior to departure, the first being to check what restrictions are in place for the country you have stayed in for 14 days before your arrival in Japan.,This can be done on the ,, but be warned — the guidelines are confusing. For some in-depth advice (and, unfortunately, some horror stories), Facebook’s , has a wealth of firsthand accounts and information.,Most people have to take a COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to departure. Testing is something you will probably be used to if you have traveled at all during the pandemic, but testing for arrival in Japan is a little more complicated.,Only some testing methods are valid for travel to Japan, including PCR and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method known as LAMP. If your test is not one of these, you won’t be allowed to board the plane — let alone pass through the numerous checks on arrival in Japan. You will also need an official MOFA testing form filled out by a medical professional. This can be very difficult to secure and seems to be the bane of many travelers, though my own experience went smoothly. Spend time researching testing companies.,When you get the MOFA form signed, make sure all your information — your name (including your middle name), passport number and date of birth — is correct. Any mistakes could cause unwanted problems down the line.,
,
,Pack provisions for your quarantine. The day before I left for the airport, I took a trip to the supermarket to buy some staples for my stay. I’m a vegetarian and had heard tales of small portion sizes and unexciting meals served during quarantine. I stocked my bag with snacks to nibble on throughout the day including vegetarian frankfurters, biscuits, crackers and potato chips. One thing I overlooked, but recommend packing, is any medication you need (with a copy of your prescription) or over-the-counter items to help with upset stomachs and the like.,Next up: the apps. You’ll need to download both the ,, which keeps track of where you are during the quarantine period, and ,, which checks for any contact with individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. You’ll also need to have the Google Maps app active on your smartphone.,A working smartphone is needed to enter the country (I was told there was also the possibility of renting one upon arrival at the airport), but a working Japanese sim card is not. The Wi-Fi connection at Haneda and Narita airports is strong and available for new arrivals to use.,
,The real journey begins at the airport you fly out of. Japan Airlines staff verified my visa, my test paperwork and pointed me to a QR code where I was told to fill in an online health questionnaire.,One positive of pandemic travel is the amount of space. I counted a grand total of 15 passengers on my flight from London. This meant that I could enjoy an almost glorious sleep sprawled out across a whole row of seats, which made a world of difference on arrival. Aboard the plane you will be asked to complete the , form, which confirms you understand the rules of quarantine.,After my long-haul flight, I arrived in Japan to a series of checkpoints that sit on a prescribed route through immigration — there’s more paperwork at each stop and you’re given a green tag to wear on your wrist, though I’m not sure it does anything but identify you as an arrival. The washrooms are taped off, so make sure to go before the plane lands. What seems like dozens — maybe hundreds — of staff line the route, many of them security guards.,My main advice for your arrival is to simply be patient. The process has, thankfully, been streamlined after outrageous reports of passengers spending upward of six hours trying to enter the country. Still, it took about four hours from landing at Haneda to arriving at my hotel. Keep your hand luggage to a minimum, bring snacks, a drink and something to read. The airport staff are friendly and many can speak English well.,Now we come to the journey’s on-arrival testing. This process involves spitting into a plastic vial in a cordoned off part of the airport, where photos of lemons and , (pickled plums) cheerfully look down at you to help get the salivary glands going. I noticed this part was a challenge for some people, especially after a long flight; children seemed to find this task particularly tricky.,After the checkpoints, you eventually arrive at the results room. Here you’ll sit with your fellow travelers and be called up according to your number to get your test result. This room had working vending machines and washrooms when I was there.,If your test is negative, you will be moved onto a bus and whisked off to a quarantine hotel (people who tested positive were simply taken to a different hotel).,
,
,It’ll be fine, I told myself, quarantine is just something I’ve got to do. Plus, I was with my partner. Throughout the process, however, staff told me that we would be in separate rooms. This wasn’t the case: upon arrival at the hotel, groups (couples and families) were asked to come forward first and we were assigned a twin room.,The tired but amiable staff talked us through how the whole thing worked. They gave me an electronic thermometer to take my body temperature at 8 a.m. everyday; meals would be delivered at 8:30 a.m., 12 p.m. and 5 p.m; alcohol and smoking are forbidden. Food deliveries are OK.,I won the hotel lottery. My room had a sofa, a large smart TV, a fridge, cups and glasses, bottled water, a kettle, coffee (not instant) and tea.,Mornings start with an announcement just before 8 a.m., first in Japanese and then in English: “We will soon be delivering your meals to your room, please refrain from going outside of your room.”,Another announcement is made 30 minutes later: “May I have your attention please, we have delivered your meals outside of your room.” The same announcement plays before every mealtime.,
,
,A bento is left outside your door in a plastic bag. The food varies depending on the hotel, but I was glad I brought extra supplies. The vegetarian meals were all vegan and, although healthy, were really small and not very exciting. It’s worth noting that there have been reports of some hotels not being able to supply meals to suit various dietary requirements.,Breakfast was the same each morning, a variation of beans and salad. Meat eaters can enjoy much more exciting treats such as fish, hamburg steak and an egg, but servings are still small and lack fruit or meaningful portions of vegetables. The hotel I was at allowed for food to be delivered by services such as Uber Eats, but these services aren’t available at every quarantine location. Plus there are rules about what items can be delivered: No raw food, frozen food, alcohol or anything that may cause a fire.,The six days of quarantine weren’t so bad. Time passed. I had to do another spit test on days two and six; I also had to complete location check-ins and health check-ups, and take automated video calls from the MySOS app.,The internet connection was decent, so I was able to catch up on some Netflix viewing (bring an HDMI cord in case you don’t get a smart TV). There was enough room for exercise and, although the window in my room didn’t open, the view kept me sane. I watched people and boats below, gazed at the industrial landscape of Kawasaki in the distance, and on clear days Mount Fuji even made a dazzling appearance.,For me, the fourth day was the hardest. It rained all day and my dinner was really small and bland. Staying positive is vital: Remember that this will not continue forever and that you will get out. Don’t let frustrations and anger take over, instead make sure to move your body, if just for some stretching, shower, get dressed each day (even if it’s just loungewear) and keep in contact with family and friends. It all helps.,
,Eventually, after the final COVID-19 test, you leave your hotel room behind. My test came on the sixth day, but from March that test will happen on the third day of wherever you are quarantining from. I also didn’t have the convenience of using public transport to make my way home, another condition that will change from March as trains, buses and taxis are once again options for new arrivals.,The options in front of me were renting a car, getting someone to collect me, taking a free shuttle bus into Tokyo or booking a private transfer. I chose to take the shuttle, thankfully it made a stop that was a 40-minute walk from my home. I stashed my hefty suitcase at a coin locker near the station, and came back for it the next day when I was allowed to use public transport again. Free at last, my partner and I bought some beer and ordered pizza for our first dinner out of quarantine and back in Japan.

			,Bold black Kampei and his more reserved counterpart, the ginger Sushiro, came from totally different backgrounds and different parts of Japan. However, they are now an unstoppable pair.,Three-year-old Sushiro was rescued from a Gunma hoarder and, having received very little attention, was so timid that he spent his early days at ARK hiding. But Kampei, an abandoned Osakan orphan about 2 years old, started to work his magic on Sushiro the moment they met.,
,Soon, shy Sushiro was asking to be picked up and started craving the attention he had never had. He is now in love with a good lap to snuggle up in. Kampei is truly fearless and despite looking like a panther he doesn’t have the agility of one. He is quite the socialite, chatty and always eager to get involved. Just like Sushiro, he is also an avid fan of laps.,Weird and wonderful, this duo would be a hit in any home.,
,Six-year-old Valiant was rescued as a puppy from the wilds of Gifu Prefecture. Wild in that he came from a place where the dogs pretty much had to fend for themselves. His senile owner had little idea of how many animals were roaming around his property, and even less about any of the dogs in particular.,With danger and uncertainty all about, Valiant was a very fearful puppy. In the years since, however, he has learned that it is possible to have trust in people and in his surroundings. Valiant is now more confident and his sweet nature has blossomed because of it.,A strong dog, he loves walks and dog runs, but is still wary around crowds of people or cars. He knows the instructions “sit,” “down” and “high five,” but his favorite is “give me a kiss.” It’ll melt your heart. Brushing will melt his.,Valiant has learned to trust, and now we’re hoping he can finally have the love and attention only a proper home can provide.,
,Rescue is nearly always a concerted effort in animal welfare, but the compassion and hope that saved these two cats came from some of its first-chair members.,The spring flood of kittens last year had gas chambers packed, but Heart Tokushima’s Susan Mercer pulled these two lucky ladies out in the desperate hope she could find other groups to take them. ARK answered the call for help, and four kittens came to Tokyo.,In the hopes that they would complement each other, Mercer had paired the colorful, friendly Mimosa (born in May) with the shy, black Pina, one month her senior. Due to earlier colds and the pandemic, the young ladies have had little exposure to prospective parents — but they are a dynamic duo.,“Mimosa is bouncy and forward, and adores people, cats, toys or whatever is at hand,” say ARK staffers. Though Pina was timid at first, she has blossomed into her own, with a rich purr that allows full expression of her deeply affectionate nature.,Though their wild antics may be more at home in a circus than an orchestra hall, these two are nonetheless “an incredibly entertaining pair.” They are sure to bring the house down.,
,Nao is a sweet little lady in Tokyo who, at the age of 14, is hoping to get a chance at more of a life than she has had.,For many years, Nao lived with an elderly woman whose caring was limited to giving the dog food. She didn’t take her on walks, she never saw to her medical care, and Nao was given no affection. When her situation came to the attention of a kindly British woman and then to the staff at ARK, her owner was happy to give the dog up.,Nao was in very bad shape at the time — horribly infested and her fur falling out in handfuls. She had almost “no visible musculature,” but that has is all changing. Now with a coat that has been shaved and is growing in nicely, she is gaining weight (up to 16 kilograms when last checked) and getting out into the fresh air for walks under open skies.,This change shows a lot of bravery and progress on her behalf. She is still a little bit nervous when touched, but she loves being near people and loves to eat. She is a gentle and healthy, fine with cats and other dogs, and she’s hoping for a home … a real home.,
,Toi came to ARK in June 2014. He’d been found abandoned in a box with his mother, who was fiercely guarding her kittens. It has been quite some years since then and, most likely to due to his timid nature, Toi has never found a home.,We’re hoping “never” can be a thing of the past, though, and that the Year of the Tiger will be Toi’s time to roar … in his own quiet way. There isn’t an ounce of aggressiveness in him. He allows his nails to be trimmed and his ears to be cleaned without putting up any fuss, and is far more comfortable with humans than before. He’s a good big brother to the newcomers, and really does want to get closer to people, but the shelter’s ruckus and general unease don’t help.,That doesn’t stop Toi from trying to get this message across though, and sometimes his purr is so loud you can hear it from a distance. Toi is handsome and has a heart of gold. All he needs is a home.,
,You may think Safe the dog gets his name from a sense of security. Unfortunately, his origin story provides a different explanation.,A safe is where this guy was kept —in a state of extreme neglect in an actual vault in a building. He was rarely fed, and in late November the owner, likely prompted by complaints, brought Safe and two other dogs to ARK. It was an act that most likely saved their lives as they were down to bare bones.,Safe is believed to be 10 years old, but he could be younger. Now weighing in at around 15 kilograms, he has filled out considerably.,Built like a Hokkaido breed or a solid Shiba, Safe is sprightly and calm and surprisingly friendly. He rarely barks and isn’t aggressive. Intelligent and trainable, Safe is very happy around people, and he’s the perfect size for those who like big dogs but need something a bit smaller. Smart, quiet, healthy, a great size — Safe gets a 10 out of 10 for being the perfect dog.,
,A hefty, yet handsome, one-eyed cat, Botamochi lost his home in mid 2020 and was first featured here in the Adopt Me! section a few months later.,Fortunately, the search for a new home didn’t take long, as only a few months later the Sato family of Osaka scooped this gem up after they lost one of their other two cats.,Now rechristened Popo, Botamochi is the third cat from ARK that the Satos have picked up.,“We found Popo when we went looking for a friend for Tama,” says father Shintaro, in reference to the family’s other cat. “We heard there hadn’t been much interest in Popo so we decided to adopt.”,The family’s kindness paid off, as Tama and Popo became friends within a week.,“We can hardly believe how well they get along,” Shintaro says. “They get really excited before dinner and groom each other like crazy. We think they are a really good match.”,Popo would most likely agree that it is indeed a fantastic match.,“Popo weighs nearly twice what Tama does and loves food, so he happily cleans up any of Tama’s leftovers,” explains Shintaro, who says the newcomer is also something of a guru. “He teaches us about relaxation by lying stretched out in a sunny spot. We simply love the sight of Popo and Tama relaxing together.”,It seems like this adoption was truly meant to be. “Thank you, Popo for coming to live with us!”,If you are interested in adopting one of these pets, email ARK at Tokyoark@arkbark.net or call 050-1557-2763 Monday to Saturday (bilingual) for more information. Tokyo ARK is an NPO founded by Briton Elizabeth Oliver. It is dedicated to rescuing and rehoming abandoned animals. All animals are vaccinated, neutered and microchipped.

			,Contributing writer,The end of February means an end to this year’s Black History Month, but that only has me thinking about its beginnings.,The annual observation of the triumphs and struggles of Black Americans hasn’t always been a month long. I can still remember it being Black History Week when I was in school — which itself was an achievement considering the attitudes of many of the white Americans in power.,
,In 1926, Carter G. Woodson, who has been called the “Father of Black History,” launched Negro History Week in the United States. He chose the second week in February to coincide with the birthdays of both President Abraham Lincoln (Feb. 12), who signed the Emancipation Proclamation that freed Confederate slaves in 1863, and Frederick Douglass (Feb. 14), an enslaved American who escaped bondage and became an orator and abolitionist. Douglass is also credited as the man who pushed Lincoln to see the better angels of his nature and allow Black men to fight for themselves in the Civil War as well as making the abolition of slavery central to the conflict.,Fifty years later, as America celebrated its bicentennial in 1976, Black educators and students across the country appealed to then-President Gerald Ford’s better angels, and the result was the expansion of Black History Week into Black History Month.,“In the bicentennial year of our independence, we can review with admiration the impressive contributions of Black Americans to our national life and culture,” Ford said on the occasion, urging Americans to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”,While we’re all aware of this historical moment now, in 1976 my friends and I hardly noticed a difference in our classrooms at Brooklyn’s Uhuru Sasa Shule, which is Swahili for “Freedom Now School.” The idea of honoring the “too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans” was etched in our school’s founding documents, and from kindergarten into my teens I attended the kind of private educational institution that Woodson could have only dreamed of.,You see, my school was founded in 1970 with the express goal of de-Europeanizing the minds of Black children by removing from us any inkling of white supremacist thought, instilling in us, instead, an abiding adoration and respect for all things of African and African American origin.,The day the expanded holiday was announced in my class, I remember the teacher explaining that the Black kids in the white-run public schools across the rest of the country only learned white American history, with mentions of non-whites here and there, and so they needed a Black History Month.,My classmates and I were all shocked to hear this. We assumed school was the same everywhere and knew that there were barely enough hours in the year to learn about all the Black heroes, mathematicians, scientists, doctors, lawyers and community leaders that populated our textbooks. We even learned about the kings and queens of African nations dating back to Songhai, Zulu, Kush, Egypt, Nubia and Ethiopia. How could all of that history possibly be squeezed into one month, let alone one week as it previously had been?,My teachers, all leaders in the Pan-African and Black Power movements, knew as Woodson did when he conceived of the holiday in 1926 that Black Americans needed a history to be proud of and to ensure that, in Woodson’s words, “the world see the Negro as a participant rather than as a lay figure in history.” I only fully understood this need when I came to Japan.,When I arrived in Tokyo to teach at an eikaiwa (English conversation) school in Nakano Ward, I took a look at the curriculum and realized it was what the teachers at Uhuru Sasa were afraid of. The lessons I was presented with focused almost entirely on positioning white people front and center. Things didn’t get much better when I moved to an assistant teacher position in Yokohama. By and large, the Black people in Japanese textbooks were the occasional athlete or some hapless kid in an underprivileged school in some destitute nation that was meant to represent all of Africa — or that one lesson on Martin Luther King, Jr. Meanwhile, the white people were well-represented in all areas: science, math, music, inventions, leadership and so on. Here was proof, right in front of my very eyes, of how the white supremacist version of American history had been exported abroad.,I did everything within my limited sphere of influence to rectify this problem. I pushed back against any stereotypes presented in the textbooks and whenever I had the opportunity to produce my own lesson materials, I’d make every effort to expand the students’ perspective of the Black world. I inserted Blackness into every lesson, putting Black people in roles that my Japanese students may have been trained to think were exclusively white.,For example, if the lesson was on occupations, and the textbooks were filled with whites in all the “brainy” jobs and blacks in all the “brawny” ones — as is too often the case — I’d rectify that by using my own pictures so that the students could see Black people in all kinds of occupations, as indeed is the case in the real world. When it came time for a holiday lesson, I taught all those children dreaming of a white Christmas about Kwanzaa, an African American holiday that was created by Maulana Karenga in 1966.,I didn’t hesitate to push back against my Japanese colleagues, either. Most of them were raised on and whitewashed by the same textbooks with similar — and sometimes worse — distortions or misrepresentations of Blackness.,The point is, even though Black History Month is coming to an end it doesn’t mean that we as educators need to stop inserting its spirit into our teachings. Every day of the year is as good as any day in February to learn the historical contributions people of African descent have made in the world, something I learned from my time at Uhuru Sasa.,When it comes to Japan, it’s probably even more necessary to expose our students to the different histories of the world — not just Black but Ainu, Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese, too. Make an appeal to the better angels of Japanese nature and do your part in fostering a generation that has empathy for those who look different.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The origin story of , has a familiar ring to it: A couple with a vision, toiling away in their spare bedroom with dreams of taking a killer product to market.,Fast-forward 12 years, and the educational resources platform has unspooled from its initial customer base in England to now serve 200 countries worldwide — with Japan as one of its focal markets in Asia.,
,Twinkl was founded upon a self-explanatory motto: “We help those who teach.” Its resources cover a wide range of disciplines, from English and computing to art and physical education. And while much of its content has been built around the British education system, many of those resources can double-up as English-language study materials. Alongside more ad hoc English study tools, such as phonics and alphabet practice, resource flexibility could be the key to unlocking the door to Japan.,Even before the pandemic, Japan’s ESL (English as a second language) teaching market was in rude health: English teaching has long been one of the most common jobs among Japan’s approximately 1.7 million foreign workers, especially for native speakers. According to their websites, major employers Aeon and ECC have more than 250 and 180 schools across the country, respectively. However, strict border pandemic protocols have made it difficult for schools to recruit new foreign teachers since spring 2020. Even the government-subsidized Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme , with the number of candidates believed to have fallen to around 4,000 in 2021 (including reappointments) compared with the 5,761 registered in fiscal 2019.,But there remains a clear demand for English education. Japan’s mid-January standardized university entrance exam has an annual participation of about 500,000 hopefuls, 99% of whom were assessed on their English proficiency last year.,Furthermore, starting in April 2020, English education was made mandatory at elementary schools for third-graders and above. This was likely a response to Japan’s poor English proficiency ranking in Asia the previous year: ,, ahead of only Laos and Tajikistan.,This suggests that the quantity of English teachers hasn’t always guaranteed quality lessons. English education resources in public and at , (English conversation) schools are often designed in-house to meet the specific objectives of a given course, with few auxiliary add-ons.,Resources can also remain in use for years with little or no updates — with some practice dialogues referring to anachronistic items like pagers and DVD players — and often need teacher guidance to have any real practical application outside the classroom. Moreover, English teaching companies in Japan often operate on a revolving-door model of recruitment, with willingness deemed more important than experience in the hiring process — a fact that highlights the importance of having good resources at a teacher’s disposal.,
,Twinkl doesn’t market itself as a wholesale replacement for the teaching materials already in use — though it can function for standalone learners — but rather offers a continuous update of complementary side dishes to accompany teaching frameworks. In England, Twinkl runs alongside the national curriculum, and the primary view to Japan is to have it coordinate with the areas of study taught at ESL schools.,“Everyone who works on the design team at Twinkl is either a former teacher, or is still teaching, and working at Twinkl as a secondary job,” says Lian McGillycuddy, manager of Twinkl’s Japan team. “They make resources that teach the same concepts that students will be learning at the same time.”,This process applies to creating resources for Japan’s ESL market, too. McGillycuddy and her team communicate resource ideas to the design team, based on what the Japanese education system expects of students at a given level, after which the in-house illustrators and content writers make the vision a reality.,Twinkl has demonstrated an ability to expand operations over the past decade, growing exponentially from its humble 2010 origins. Now in its 12th year, it has more than 12 million sign-ups worldwide, including 2.8 million new additions in the past 12 months alone. Twinkl creates an average of 13,000 resources each month, with the past 12 witnessing over 268 million resource downloads, partially fueled by a huge uptake in pandemic-enforced home schooling.,In spite of these figures, Twinkl’s presence in Japan is still small, where it competes with other such online learning platforms as ,, , and ,. There are currently only 18,550 registered users in the country, including free members and subscribers.,“We are trying to show Japan how popular Twinkl is, but because we don’t have as big a presence in Japan yet, it’s a little more difficult,” says McGillycuddy. “But I think if we keep showing how good the resources are, the word will spread.”,McGillycuddy is hoping high-profile collaborations can help Twinkl’s expansion. Current collaborations include cartoons “Peppa Pig” and “Numberblocks”, both of which appear on TV screens in Japan and are aimed at the largest segment of Twinkl learners: children.,She adds that the company is currently looking to collaborate with Japanese television shows, too. “It would be great for Japanese people to see something that’s familiar to them in our resources.”,
,
,Twinkl also has ambassadors scattered throughout the country, such as Michelle Nomura, an English tutor at ABC Club in Fukuoka who started using the platform in 2016.,“Twinkl has helped me a lot, not only for my lessons, but also for personal use raising my bilingual daughters,” she says. Nomura cites Twinkl Create, a program that allows users to design their own resources, the Twinkl app, which features in-built 3D and augmented reality functionalities, and Twinkl eBooks as resources that “really make life easier.”,Lea Takaiwa, a teacher at English Adventure Academy in Shiga Prefecture, echoes Nomura’s sentiment. “Twinkl is really an amazing educational site for English learners and teachers,” she says. “It is introducing me to different places, countries, cultures and many more that I can share with my students so they will be familiar with the outside world.”,But while Twinkl’s most obvious application in Japan is to the ESL market, it’s reluctant to pigeonhole itself. Part of the Japan team’s responsibilities is to localize resources that can be used by educators in the country’s public schooling system. Increasing Twinkl awareness through weekly newsletters and social media posts in Japanese is integral to achieving this ambition.,“(Twinkl) has been received very well,” says McGillycuddy. “We’re just trying to get the word out to more Japanese teachers and parents that we are here.”,For more information, visit ,.,

			,Contributing writer,A man, visibly agitated, walks into ,, a cafe opened by Vaughan and Rie Allison in the spring of 2020.,
,Vaughan greets him, like he does with all his guests. The man responds with pleasantries; he then gets to the reason for his unease. “My wife is pregnant,” he says. “She just went into labor at the hospital.” Because of COVID restrictions, he is unable to be there with her, adding, “I can’t be at home. I’m a bit nervous.”,He then asks, “I’m here. Is that all right?”,“Yes,” Vaughan responds. “You stay here.”, He has sculpted features framed by neatly trimmed facial hair and a large mouth, perennially curled into a smile. Speaking to him via video chat, he sits at the end of a long table in ,, a gallery owned by the Allisons that’s just a stone’s throw from Mia Mia. He’s dressed in a white sweatshirt that hugs his body, a dark green hat made of a woven fabric, and black-framed glasses tied with a strap that dangles near his ears. His long brown hair hangs around his head.,
,
,“What is hospitality?” he asks in a thick Australian accent. He’s serious, but his grin is still noticeable. “The other day, we had a training session with the staff, and I said, ‘OK, let’s look it up in the dictionary.’” Vaughan straightens his glasses and pulls out his phone. He rereads the definition — the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers — before asking me, as he asked his staff, “How much of making the best coffee in the world is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers?” The staff answered him with a list of 100 tasks and practices: cleaning the streets in front of the cafe, greeting pedestrians walking by, taking customers’ coats when they enter the cafe.,Hospitality is, he says, about creating “a space where people feel welcomed.”,Our conversation goes on for two hours, traversing a range of topics — Vaughan is well-versed in just about any subject. I ask him how he became this way: interested in each person he meets, engaging with them on anything from the banalities of Tokyo life to its more defining moments.,“It’s in the DNA,” he responds. “I get it from my mother.”,Vaughan grew up in Melbourne, Australia, pulling espresso shots from the age of 10 at his family’s theater restaurant. He recalls how his mother would roam the dining room, speaking with customers to learn “something beautiful” about each one before committing those stories to memory. Then, she would share them on stage during the intermission of whatever production was being presented.,“If it was a 50th anniversary, OK, what’s the secret to 50 years?” Vaughan says his mother would ask from the stage.,Rie, ,, also grew up around hospitality, working, as a teenager, in her family’s , (tavern) near a pilot training school in the southern coastal city of Miyazaki. She became close with the pilots, many of whom attended her and Vaughan’s wedding in Tokyo in 2011., As the crowd of regulars and first-timers grows, fueled by coffee, the expectant father checks his phone, waiting for word on the birth. Vaughan orchestrates conversation among the customers: “This man,” he says, “is just about to be a father. He needs some advice.” There’s no shortage of suggestions — “Stay calm.” “Good luck.”, 5 p.m. The after-work crowd arrives. The sun begins to set and the customers at the cafe are beginning to get anxious for the soon-to-be dad.,
,
, , (pronounced “my-a my-a”) mean a communal and temporary shelter in Wadawurrung, an Aboriginal Australian language — and this 30-square-meter location, within walking distance from Higashi Nagasaki Station on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, is similarly a space for people to meet and collaborate.,Rie chimes in from off camera on the need for spaces that facilitate creative partnerships. “Everyone wants to do something,” she says, “but they’re not sure if they can do it.” She comes into view, pulling up a chair next to Vaughan. She has short black hair and wears a bright, multicolored sweater. Her voice is quiet, but firm. “Let’s not say no to anything,” she says, explaining how the couple has fostered their community. “Just say yes. And think afterward.”,In front of the gallery, the Allisons have built a small garden out of layered boxes filled with dirt and sprouting plants, to draw passersby to aid in its care — the building blocks of a communal space. Around the garden, Rie has designed benches, long and welcoming, with compost for coffee grounds inside. A small wooden box, filled with shelves for books to take and to leave, rests on the sidewalk. Recently, it was filled with children’s books, and days earlier, they found an anonymous letter inside. “As I was taking my morning walk, I discovered the book post,” it said, handwritten in pen on floral stationary. “I am very happy that there is such an interesting place in the neighborhood.”,
,
,Vaughan walks outside with laptop in hand, near the garden and benches. An endless stream of schoolchildren in orange hats walk by as he stands on the street. He waves and bows. An older man approaches with a plate of food in hand. They exchange greetings, and Vaughan introduces him as the owner of a restaurant down the street. Vaughan laughs and says, “It’s very difficult to do work here because conversations happen with all the people that walk past.”,The Allisons have helped put the area around Higashi Nagasaki Station on the map. This sleepy stop in between the central hub of Ikebukuro and the capital’s bedroom communities is now known as a destination for food and coffee. Several Japanese magazines have left their usual downtown haunts to feature the neighborhood, with Mia Mia front and center in the coverage. This is partly due to Vaughan’s own media savvy, having worked as a model and in the music industry. He has also created , — a website, an event, a shop — that aims to shine a spotlight on top coffee shops and support the cafe community. He’s serious about his craft, citing Eiichi Kunitomo of the renowned , as something of a mentor, boasting that Mia Mia is the only cafe in the world to purchase Kunitomo’s beans wholesale.,Vaughan pulls out a small white pamphlet, its cover printed with an illustration of Mia Mia, crowded with a mess of locals and cafe regulars. Inside the pamphlet is a map of Higashi-Nagasaki with meticulous illustrations by Hikaru Yamamoto of local shops, small blurbs and a short lyrical ode to the neighborhood written by Tokyo Weekender editor Paul McInnes, himself one of the cafe’s regulars. The small map is both a guide to the area and a neighborhood manifesto — foldable, physical evidence of the benefits of community building., Vaughan has kept the cafe open after hours for the crowd of around 20 customers — many strangers until that day — eager to see this story to the end. The man receives word that his baby, a girl, has been born. There’s a collective sigh of relief and a round of congratulations for the new dad.,“There were tears from everyone,” Vaughan recalls, smiling. “It was a magical moment.”,

			,SPONSORED CONTENT,When offices closed down due to the pandemic in early 2020, workers had to figure out their minimum needs — the basic equipment, space and environment for them to continue to be productive. Yet it did not take long for some to realize the goal should not be to reproduce the traditional office environment as closely as possible, but to create spaces and practices that could make work and even life in general even more fulfilling.,Hidaiiyo Co. has taken up this challenge, and with its new coworking space Trace it is taking a big step toward creating a work-life environment that nourishes mind, body and soul.,Trace is situated in Hida, Gifu Prefecture, an old castle town in the heart of Japan’s Northern Alps. It is a short drive from Takayama, the popular tourist destination renowned for its traditional architecture, particularly the steep , thatched-roof farmhouses in the village of Shirakawa. Hida, on the other hand, boasts a historical commercial district populated by elegant wooden , (townhouses), Trace now occupying one of them.,The name Trace comes from the Japanese word ,, which is also used to mean trajectory or path, and is intended to evoke the journeys and adventures of the people and companies that spend time there, hopefully stimulated and facilitated by the environment it provides.,Hidaiiyo’s goal with Trace and its other endeavors is to not only provide a functional space for office workers to get their work done away from home, but also to integrate all the aspects of the surrounding community to create a synergistic effect that fosters creativity and fulfillment.,Inside Trace itself are comfortable shared workspaces, private rooms for meetings and a kitchenette. Individual memberships are priced at ¥25,000 per month and ¥40,000 monthly for corporate memberships.,In addition to the workplace amenities, use of the facility’s sauna room can be added to a membership. There may be no better way to relax and reset after a day spent focused on work. It may not be a typical office practice, but could a lunchtime sauna help boost afternoon productivity? This is the place to experiment.,The surrounding area is also part of the concept. Trace is on Shirakabe Dozogai street, a historical district of traditional warehouses and townhouses with a small canal teeming with colorful carp from spring to autumn. The refined elegance of this neighborhood is a world away from typical business districts filled with traffic, advertisements and crowds of people focused only on their destinations.,Zooming out encompasses the greater region — Hida’s narrow valley with its rivers and farms, the forested hills that surround the town on every side and to the west the impressive peaks of the Northern Alps, all of which can be made part of the experience of working and staying here.,The concept even extends to after work. Hidaiiyo also runs Iori Stay, a “distributed” hotel that consists of separate townhouses that are rented out individually. There are four Iori Stay locations in Hida and several more in nearby Takayama. All the Hida locations are just a few minutes’ walk to Trace. Absolutely no crowded trains or traffic jams here. The townhouses have been renovated in a style that combines traditional elegance and beauty with modern comfort and function. Guests can also choose from a variety of experience-based tours and activities designed to deepen familiarity with the local community and its traditions.,The Trace experience can be used for short “workations,” corporate training camps, as a second office away from more urban headquarters, or as a permanent base for businesses that are fully remote or locally focused. The world is changing and the time is right to create a new work-life balance focused on inspiration and health.,For more information, visit ,The Japan Times LTD. All rights reserved."

			,Contributing writer,Conversations about nonfungible tokens and their role in fashion appear to be running out of steam on the world stage. The arc from initial NFT excitement to eventual burnout has been remarkably short, and in the context of fashion — where the production run of a particular design sometimes tallies less than 100 items — the industry doesn’t need to introduce any artificial scarcity when it has the real thing.,Still, it is probably best not to abandon NFTs just yet, with some of the biggest names in Japanese retail recently announcing plans to engage in the world of digital assets. BEAMS fired the first shot on Feb. 25 by partnering with Rakuten’s NFT marketplace, followed by Shibuya 109’s March 2 announcement of a collaboration with Hong Kong-based digital platform The Sandbox. While both brands have always adjusted their image to remain in sync with the times, both are enduring tastemakers who rarely put a foot wrong when it comes to engaging with young people looking to express themselves.,
,The late start might make you think that these brands have missed the boat, but what we are seeing now in terms of fashion is a potential long-term strategy. The first wave of NFTs has been characterized by booms, busts and get-rich-quick schemes for the digital age that mimic hyped streetwear drops (the NFT connoisseur’s wardrobe of choice). Such customers are of little concern to a second wave of corporate NFTs, which target younger people whose greatest investment to date is probably their smartphone.,In the case of ,, the one-time mecca of the , subculture of the late 1990s, the focus is less on NFTs as an investment than as status symbols and digital modes of expression. Shibuya 109 is also quick to stress that consumers will be able to earn NFTs through online games free of charge — the perfect price point for a generation used to grinding for rewards on smartphones.,It is also part of Shibuya 109’s endeavors to reach international tourists who have been locked out of the market. For many young women — especially those living in East Asia — the iconic building is a destination synonymous with the “Tokyo fashion look,” a reality for a domestic market keen to be taken seriously on the world stage, but one that should have been capitalized on in earnest decades ago.,
,
,That said, it is hard to know what to expect from the recent announcements by BEAMS and Shibuya 109. The virtual worlds where these NFTs exist are still in development and the proof-of-concept visuals are a little underwhelming — a cardinal sin in the world of fashion. While BEAMS and Shibuya 109 have telegraphed their NFT ambitions, it is difficult to get overly excited about the final form of the asset — somewhere between “entertainment” and “online avatar” — until more is revealed.,But this is all to frame these developments from a consumer’s perspective. From a retailer’s perspective, this burgeoning metaverse offers an advertising-supported platform to target youthful shoppers. It’s based on an assumption that young people will actually visit these locations in the first place, but for brands whose cultural relevance is everything, it is a cultural turn they need to be part of. Of course, seeing the emerging metaverse as yet another place that is going to support advertising saps even more enthusiasm out of the experience, but it is probably worth reserving judgment until some practical applications are actually ready to showcase.,Having the support of established and experienced companies like Rakuten and The Sandbox is clearly the strategy to avoid the inevitable growing pains that emerge when brick-and-mortar fashion retailers engage with digital real estate, and starting fashionably late allows companies to bet on a metaverse that is already successful.,How successful, you might ask? As a case in point, a plot of land in The Sandbox’s flagship virtual world recently sold for nearly ¥500 million, a sum that would go a long way in buying a physical property space in central Shibuya.,Those looking to visualize this unknown territory can take a look at a new app from 1SEC, the company behind Japan’s first fully digital fashion label 1Block. The app, , (“drip” being the current slang for haute fashion), allows users to try on NFT clothing using augmented reality technology. Crucially, users can only try on clothes they own as NFTs, and it goes without saying that the NFT must also be compatible with the app for the digital clothes to be rendered.,It is somewhat sad to see brands replicating models of scarcity in a virtual world where true abundance is possible. However, what we are seeing now is only something early adopters can play around with. Once such technology reaches the average customer at Shibuya 109, then we will have really turned a corner.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The humble yet versatile , (carrot) is thought to have arrived in Japan via China at some point in either the 16th or 17th century. The Japanese originally called it a “,” (celery carrot) since, back then, the word “ninjin” was used to refer to ginseng root, which the carrot somewhat resembles.,However, the type of carrot that was grown here up until the Meiji Era (1868-1912) is now known as the red or Oriental carrot. Unlike its Western counterparts, the red carrot has, as its name suggests, a dark red color and is sweeter. It’s also harder to grow, which is why the orange Western types are what’s mainly consumed in Japan these days.,
,Carrots appear in all kinds of dishes that are popular in Japan, and the recipe featured here is a traditional one from Okinawa known as , (shredded carrot). It’s said that everyone in Okinawa has their own recipe for ,, so consider this to be just one variation. The word “shiri-shiri” is Okinawan for “,” (shredded) and there’s a theory that it is an ideophone derived from the “shiri shiri” sound that the carrots make on a shredder. It is a colorful side dish that works well in bento boxes, or you can increase the egg count and have it for breakfast instead.,
,
,You can use vegetable oil instead of the sesame oil and omit the sesame seeds if desired. Also, try using canned luncheon meat cut into strips instead of the tuna. You can also leave out the tuna and add a teaspoon of dashi stock granules for extra umami.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Deep-fried breaded meat dishes are enjoyed in many parts of the world: South American milanesa, Central European schnitzel and decadent chicken Kiev. In Japan, appetites are similarly sated by ,.,A compound of the words “,” (pork) and “,” (short for , [cutlet]), this dish is one of many Japanese takes on , (Western food). The dish ,, and others say that a , (pork cutlet) served with shredded cabbage popped up on the menu of Ginza restaurant , four years later — where it remains to this day.,
,Farther north, in Kanda, is ,, the restaurant that is credited with serving the first actual tonkatsu in 1929. Tokyo’s , (downtown) area witnessed a boom in places that served tonkatsu around the 1930s, remnants of which can still be found in districts like Jimbocho. The popularity of the dish is now widespread, from Michelin-recognized restaurants nestled in the capital’s downtown to the chain restaurants of the suburbs — the first of which, Wako, launched in 1958 and has since expanded overseas.,This list could easily be a top 50, but what follows are five prize-fighting tonkatsu specialists in Tokyo chosen for their renown and reasonable prices. So grab some hot mustard and shredded cabbage for your sides and tuck in.,
,
,In explaining the reason for conferring a Bib Gourmand accolade on ,, close to Musashi-Koyama Station, the Michelin Guide cites the restaurant’s use of light batter and comparatively less oil than your average tonkatsu joint. It’s a recipe that has impressed customers and made it pretty tough to get a seat at the nine-chair counter. Reservations will be necessary.,If you’re able to get in, what awaits is a world of sophistication, where classical music plays with the percussive accompaniment of breaded pork gently bubbling in a bronze cauldron of oil. Experiencing the symphony play out from your seat is part of the fun.,The , (loin fillet) set (¥1,600) gets you tea and chunky , (pickled vegetables) so fresh it’s like they’ve just been made; warming , (soup with daikon, pork and ,); a bowl of rice; and the main event itself, encased in pale gold panko.,The word “mochi” in the shop’s name seems more than appropriate when you take your first bite, the fillet gently tenderized beforehand for optimal chew. Take a close look and you can almost see it falling apart. The meal also comes with a mound of , (shredded) cabbage that is best experienced with a dab of the Chinese-style dressing. For cabbage fiends out there, your first refill is on the house.,Koyama 3-22-7, Shinagawa-ku, 142-0062; 03-3786-1464; takeout available,
,
,Make your way to Gakugei-Daigaku Station in Meguro Ward and you’ll be within walking distance of one of Tokyo’s more relaxed tonkatsu shops. Katsuyoshi’s homespun interior features vintage beer advertisements, chunky wooden furniture and the hum of nocturnal jazz spilling into the space. The main attraction, the rōsu-katsu set, costs ¥1,830. If you’re not looking to spend as much, though, the regular tonkatsu set is priced at just ¥1,100 and still tastes divine.,The loin cut here is covered with a thick batter unpunctuated by panko; it’s barely used. It’s something of a rarity and results in more of a chew than a crunch. The cut is also huge, a juicy monster of a fillet that will allow for ample time to soak up the atmosphere as you work your way through it. The set comes with tea, extra-salty miso soup, pickles and rice. Truthfully, Katsuyoshi represents any number of genuine , (neighborhood) tonkatsu joints: Unhurried, unfussy and unhyped.,Chuo-cho 1-17-11, Meguro-ku, 152-0001; 03-5704-2110; takeout available,
,
,If you’re in Daikanyama and looking for a wholesome lunch without the high prices that the neighborhood is known for, direct yourself to Genta. This subterranean dining spot features a friendly atmosphere with both table and counter seating. The lunch menu is a trove of delicious bargains, with the tonjiru tonkatsu set clocking in at just ¥1,100. If , (minced pork cutlet) is your jam, then you’ll only be set back ¥1,045 for the pleasure.,The crunch factor is strong at Genta, whose cooks deliver a masterclass in deep-fried texture, even if the measure of the meat is fairly modest. The cuts are leveled up when slathered with the shop’s zingy katsu sauce or some , (seven-flavor spice). Paired with rice, pickles and washed down with a soup so chock full of veggies that it’s like a meal in itself, lunch here is affordable and filling.,Sarugakucho 24-7, Shibuya-ku, 150-0033; 03-3496-4192,
,
,For more in the realm of affordability, check out the deep-fried lunch served at Tonkatsu Enraku in Ota Ward. You’ll almost certainly need to line up outside and wait for a seat, but you can watch the master at work in the meantime — the flames licking the side of the scorched, shining pan he uses while tending to the various breaded fillets within. Using bare hands all the while, his skin must be made of stronger stuff than most. At only ¥1,000, lunch is incredibly cheap.,The 90-gram rōsu-katsu is pliable and succulent, covered in craggy panko that is submerged in lard oil and fried to perfection. Naturally, it comes with cabbage — fresh cut for each order — soup populated with almost unending little pork morsels, carrots and daikon, a plate of rice and a surprise helping of homemade potato salad adding creaminess to the proceedings.,Enraku is another shop that has earned Bib Gourmand status from the Michelin Guide and there’s no surprise why: Eating this well for so little seems almost too good to be true.,Ikegami 6-1-4, Ota-ku, 146-0082; 03-3754-8243; takeout available,
,
,Another spot that’s sure to have a line outside, , in the Takadanobaba area goes the extra mile to extend its hospitality to those waiting. When it is raining, staff will ferry out tea to customers huddled beneath umbrellas and poring over the menu. Once inside, Hinata delivers a close-quarters affair at a long counter complemented by elegantly simple interiors and stylish hexagonal floor tiles.,Lunch, as per this working city’s custom, is normally a big deal. But here, it is a revelation. You have the option to choose between two different types of pork: ,, pigs with “three origins” (usually a cross between Berkshire, Duroc and Landrace breeds) fed on herbs used in Chinese traditional medicine, and , (Berkshire pig). Once you’ve decided on either the 130-gram regular cutlet for ¥1,000 or the , cutlet at 190 grams for ¥1,500, sit back and soak up the ambience. Both come served with the usual katsu sauce, but the sea salt provided for dipping makes this a bit redundant, albeit delicious.,Additionally, bigger spenders can also book a spot for Hinata’s evening , (eat and compare) course, involving different cuts of pork from tenderloin to rump, for ¥3,900 per person.,Takadanobaba 2-13-9, Shinjuku-ku, 169-0075; 03-6480-2424; takeout available,
,If you’re up for spending a little bit more, , is very much a treat. Located in Suginami Ward’s Minamiasagaya neighborhood, Narikura’s tonkatsu set offers up either two (¥5,000) or three (¥6,200) cutlets — including , (special loin), , (rib-eye) and , (millefeuille) style — though regular menu items are also available. The cooking style here is low and slow, resulting in a pale tempura-esque panko coating coupled with meat that melts in your mouth. Understandably, the menu has nabbed some awards.,Similar accolades go to the equally not-so-wallet-friendly , in Yotsuya. Again, the panko here is light and deliciously crispy, but the preparation is different, with whole loins cooked and sliced into meaty medallions for seriously tender results. Though the menu here features ¥4,000-plus items, more affordable options are available such as the rōsu-katsu set at ¥2,197.,Steps away from Chawanbu is the friendly ,. They use 100% lard oil for frying here and it’s their , (cutlet on rice with egg; ¥1,300) that is the star of the show.,If you find yourself in the Akihabara electronics district and you’re hankering for some tonkatsu, swing by the shitamachi-style Marugo. The lines can be enormous (avoid the place on Sundays) but your patience will pay off once you’re inside another of the city’s acclaimed shops. The special rōsu-katsu set (¥2,200) is fairly easy on the budget and very easy on the taste buds.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

				,
			,Contributing writer, In 2008, I volunteered to help jobless people at , following the “Lehman shock.” It was my first experience with activism and I met people from Posse there.,
, Poverty in Japan tends to be hidden. I went to a university seminar about it and realized how serious it is. In my search for solutions, I volunteered and found Posse., We had slightly more men in our group before the pandemic started, but now around 80% are women. Most of them are students in their teens or 20s, some have full-time jobs. Many of our members are also minorities in some way: women, mixed race or LGBTQ., Poverty is increasing and I think it will increase further if we don’t change. One barrier is the , (self-responsibility) mindset in Japan that results in people being less empathetic toward others., The number of consultations concerning mistreatment in the workplace increased from 2,000 cases a year to around 5,000 cases in the first year (of the pandemic)., Actually, the laws themselves are pretty decent. The problem is that companies don’t follow these laws, and the penalties aren’t strong enough. For example, the law says people should not work more than eight hours a day and up to 40 hours per week. If they work more, they should be paid 20% to 50% more for the overtime., Women and foreign workers who are non-regular employees, who are themselves the most vulnerable as many of them had jobs that were affected by the pandemic., For a long time, female workers have been treated as people working for extra money because society expected them to have husbands who would provide for them. Of course, this is not the case., One solution could be that we value care work more. Right now, care work is treated like something anyone can do and the pay is low. That’s not the case, it is quite difficult and payments for it should increase., No. Elitism is a huge problem in Japan and I used to think that I could only spark change by becoming a part of the system. However, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders showed us all that by amplifying the concerns of smaller social movements you can rally the youth. We need that in Japan.,
,
, Young people in Japan aren’t taught they are capable of affecting change. Posse wants young people to know that they can make change through activism. The first step is education., Yes, there are a lot. , where we helped a high school sophomore through the collective bargaining process and, as a result, got him two years of unpaid overtime at his job. That action also resulted in payments to the 70 other employees of the company. He was the only one to stand up to the company, but it resulted in justice for the rest of his coworkers., Jiko-sekinin, they feel like they are on their own. People, especially young people, feel trapped in this capitalist competition so they don’t want to disadvantage themselves by speaking up (and being seen as complaining). If they fail, they simply blame themselves., According to the polls, young people are becoming more conservative. However, I don’t think it’s that simple, we just don’t want our situations to become worse. The pandemic has made a lot of us passive, but there is also a sense that we are trapped in our current situations. So to answer the question, I think we have to clearly show to young people a vision of how things can be. If there is no vision, there’s nothing to work toward., I enjoy reading science fiction. Ken Liu (“The Paper Menagerie”) is one of my favorite authors., It allows me to escape reality for a little while, but also helps me think outside the box. That way of thinking helps when I return to reality., Yes, I’m interested in “solarpunk” (a genre that envisions a future where humanity has solved problems like climate change) and “ecopunk” (a genre that focuses on how humans interact with their environment) because they explore the role of activism, but that stuff hasn’t been translated into Japanese yet., One idea that has stayed with me is from science-fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin who believed that the role of a writer is to fuel imagination. I need imagination because I am a Japanese man who lives in Tokyo. Books allow me to see different perspectives and different lives., Yes, because we need to think about what comes next. Abroad, activism is performed in imaginative ways, but we aren’t at that level in Japan yet., I’d like to make a project that could help others visualize a new kind of society that isn’t centered around money but is based on valuing people. If we use our imaginations, we could really blossom in that way.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,“Intimate Stranger” represents something of a comeback for its star, Asuka Kurosawa, and a return for its director, Mayu Nakamura. Though long in demand as a supporting actor in TV dramas and films, Kurosawa is playing her first leading role in two decades, following her breakout star turn in Shinya Tsukamoto’s 2002 cult hit “A Snake of June.”,Meanwhile, Nakamura, who made her feature debut with the 2006 youth drama “The Summer of Stickleback,” has spent much of her time since making documentaries, including her 2019 film about political activist Kunio Suzuki.,
,“Intimate Stranger,” which premiered in the Nippon Cinema Now section at last year’s Tokyo International Film Festival and is showing in select theaters throughout Japan, tells the story of Megumi (Kurosawa), a middle-aged woman whose search for her missing teenage son leads her into a strangely close relationship with a young con artist, Yuji (Fuju Kamio), who claims to know the lost boy.,The film had a long gestation, with Nakamura writing an early version of the script about the time she directed “The Summer of Stickleback.” ”A lot of things have changed since then,” she says in a joint interview with Kurosawa. “When the film finally took shape, the coronavirus was spreading, so we decided to change the setting to (take place during) the pandemic.”,In addition to making extensive script rewrites, Nakamura spent a long time searching for her lead. “It was not a role that just anyone could play,” she says. Her quest led her to Kurosawa, after viewing the actor’s work in not only “A Snake of June,” in which she plays a telephone counselor who is sexually harassed by a stalker, but also Sion Sono’s dark thriller “Cold Fish” (2010) and Takahisa Zeze’s “Sanctuary” (2006). In particular, Kurosawa’s portrayal of a mother searching for her lost child in “Sanctuary” resonated with Nakamura.,“In that film, Ms. Kurosawa had many different faces: erotic, scary, a normal woman, a mother,” the director says. “In France, there are people like Isabelle Huppert and Juliette Binoche who can play many different roles, but in Japan, there are very few like that.” And Kurosawa, she found, was one of them.,In approaching the role, Kurosawa says that she did not find it difficult to enter the mindset of Megumi, a woman who has lost both her grown son and, much earlier, her 3-month-old baby. “I myself am a mother of three children, so I could understand the emotions of a woman whose child had died a few months after birth, and whose love for it had become warped because of that tragedy,” she explains.,“However, her dubious behavior was not clear to me, and I found it difficult to understand,” she adds. “As an actress, I thought it would be better if I didn’t try to play Megumi by identifying with her. Instead, I approached the role as if I were someone who could be close to her … say, a friend.”,
,
,While shaping Megumi as a character whose motivations are not easily understood, Nakamura also wrote an ambiguous ending that chills but doesn’t explain. “I left (the ending) up to the imagination of the audience,” she says. “Depending on the viewer, the interpretation is completely different.”,Among Nakamura’s models for the film were two psychological horrors: Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s “Retribution” (2006) and Roman Polanski’s “Repulsion” (1965). “I told everyone that I was aiming for film noir, not horror, but when I said that to people in Japan, they were like, ‘Huh?’” she says with a laugh.,Working with veteran cinematographer Tomohiko Tsuji, Nakamura shot the film in what she describes as a “normal fashion,” but in post-production she used bleach bypass, a film processing method that desaturates colors to achieve a black-and-white look. Invented by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa for the 1960 Kon Ichikawa film “Her Brother,” the method creates a feeling of being in interior spaces that, in their ghostly paleness, unsettles the viewer in “Intimate Stranger.”,The feature, with its stylization and hidden depths, is quite unlike Nakamura’s documentaries, which are the products of dogged reporting, not artfully filmed introspection. “I originally got into films because I wanted to do fiction, but I had a lot of trouble raising money,” she says. “But with a documentary, I could do it on my own.” That experience, however, proved useful in making “Intimate Stranger.” “When the pandemic happened, I wanted to incorporate it into the film, to shoot what was happening now,” she says. “My documentary background helped me to do that.”,The film, Kurosawa says, “is the only one of its kind, and only (Nakamura) could direct it this way. I don’t think any other director, male or female, could have done it. It’s unique.”,One thing that sets the story apart from other domestic dramas is the eroticized relationship that develops between Megumi and Yuji. As his stay at Megumi’s apartment lengthens, Yuji becomes a kind of surrogate son to the bereft woman. But before shaving Yuji with a straight razor — a method she insists on despite his initial queasiness — Megumi lathers his face with a touch like that of a lover, not a mother. But when she presses the blade to his throat, her expression suggests that, angered by his deceptions, she is debating whether to slit it. “When men get shaved by a barber there’s a fine line between fear and pleasure,” Nakamura says. “I thought that was interesting.”,Also intriguing to the director were the strong bonds between mothers and sons in Japan that struck her as exceptional when she returned to Japan after living in the United States and the United Kingdom for 14 years. “Compared to other countries, (in Japan, that bond) is very close, with the mother treating her son like a lover,” she says. “Of course, it depends on the person.”,Also different from the West, she adds, is the prevalence here of the “,” (“it’s me, it’s me”) scam, in which a fraudster impersonates a mark’s son over the phone to extract cash for a supposed emergency. Yuji and his associates run such schemes in the film. “In the U.S. and Europe, when a grown son comes crying to his parents for a big sum of money, they’d hang up on him,” Nakamura says. “They’d say ‘Are you kidding?’ And in Japan, it’s always the son, never the daughter, who’s asking for the money. After being abroad for a long time, I thought of that as a symbol of Japanese society.”,As Megumi, Kurosawa adds layers that are darker and more terrifying than the “gullible mother” stereotype. “Intimate Stranger” may be a pandemic movie, but the feelings of grief and loneliness that Kurosawa portrays so brilliantly are timeless, universal and, in Megumi’s case, endless.,“Intimate Stranger” is showing now at Euro Space in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo. It will be screened in cinemas nationwide at later dates.

			,Contributing writer,Slides of family trips from long ago sit in many a drawer or box, little seen as the technology for making and showing them fades into the past.,But John Junkerman, a Tokyo-based documentary filmmaker, went beyond preserving the color slide photos his father took of their family’s stay in early postwar Hayama, a seaside town on the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture. Last December, he released the photographs in a book, “Hayama 1952-1953 Charles Junkerman,” published by Yobisha. Junkerman’s introduction and captions are in both Japanese and English.,
,
,Though an amateur with no formal training in photography, Junkerman’s father, Charles, took hundreds of photos with his Nikon camera and Kodachrome color slide film, both then unobtainable luxuries for ordinary Japanese. The film could not be processed in Japan, so Charles had to send it to the United States.,More than being rare color glimpses of a vanished world, the book’s 270 photos reveal a keen, sympathetic eye for their subjects, beginning with Junkerman and his two older siblings. But while photographing his children frolicking on the beach in Hayama, then known as a summer retreat for well-off Tokyoites, Charles’ interest extended to the local kids, fishermen and farmers. His photos form a fascinating ethnographic study of Hayama society, from its workaday life to its games and festivals, only seven years after the end of World War II.,Born in 1952, Junkerman was an infant during his family’s Japan sojourn and has no memories of it, but seeing the slides as a boy was special for him, as well as for everyone in the family.,
,
,“My parents really fell in love with Japan,” he says in an interview with The Japan Times. “They were young, in their 20s, and when they first went to Japan, it was their first time overseas. It was a very special experience for them. Everything was new and exciting and interesting.”,Then a U.S. Navy lieutenant and physician posted to a naval hospital in nearby Yokosuka, Charles used his off-duty hours to explore his Hayama neighborhood and Japanese culture — he and his wife, Anne, amassed a collection of Japanese prints and lacquerware.,“We lived a three-minute walk from the beach,” Junkerman says. “So they got to know the fishermen. Then my father bought a car and drove between Hayama and Yokosuka, which was a 20-minute drive over the mountains, every day to work. He would stop along the way and take photographs of farmers planting and harvesting rice.”,With Yokosuka and the surrounding area spared from bombing during the war, what Charles was seeing through his lens “was really prewar Japan, when people were primarily engaged in agriculture,” Junkerman says. Also, compared to many urban Japanese, who had suffered through food shortages after the war, Hayama’s fishermen and farmers were “relatively well off and able to sustain themselves. So there’s a sense of peacefulness (in the photos), a sense of being able to make ends meet.”,After Anne died in 2010, followed by Charles in 2014, Junkerman inherited the slides. “They always were very much implanted in my brain,” he says. “I’ve often talked about how my connection to Japan really has its roots in those slides.” Hearing his stories about his father’s photos, an NHK producer told him that people in Hayama would be interested in seeing them. The producer then contacted an NPO in Hayama about arranging a small exhibition.,
,
,Held in 2014 at a local library, the exhibition garnered positive responses from the public. “The people who came were saying that these are very rare photographs — especially photographers. There are quite a few photographers living in Hayama, and they just raved about the photographs,” Junkerman says.,One reason is that because they were taken with Kodachrome film, the images had held their colors better than photos made using later processes.,“With Kodachrome the pigment isn’t contained in the film, but in the developing bath,” Junkerman says. “It’s an additive process. So you end up with a very thick positive (image), whereas with other kinds of color film it’s a subtractive process and you get a thin image that fades over time. But even after 70 years, Kodachrome still looks vivid. (My father’s photos) look as fresh as if they were taken yesterday.”,Mitsuru Okada, the head of local publisher Yobisha, was also impressed by the photos when he attended the exhibition. Soon after, he and Junkerman began compiling the photos for publication, which resulted in “Hayama 1952-1953 Charles Junkerman.”,“It’s very gratifying to have the book and to be able to share the photos,” Junkerman says.,While Hayama has changed in the decades since the Junkerman family called the town home, the Western-style house in which they lived still stands. “My parents were lucky to find it,” Junkerman says of the dwelling, which was the one-time summer residence of former Prime Minister Taro Katsura. “By Japanese standards, it was a very grand summer home. Though by American standards, it was fairly average.”,Also, descendants of Charles’ subjects and even some of the subjects themselves are still living in the Hayama area. Together with veteran photographer and Hayama resident Bruce Osborn, Junkerman has started a project to locate them.,“Of course, the only people still alive were children at that time,” he says. “We know of one who grew up in that area. He and his brother still run the local liquor store. He identified himself in the book after it was published. He remembers some of the others so we should be able to track down a number of them.” Osborn plans to take new photographs to complement the ones Junkerman’s father shot seven decades ago.,Charles continued to take photographs in the 40 places around the world where he and Anne lived after leaving Japan: “He was a quiet man,” Junkerman says of his father. “His way of interacting with the world was through the lens of a camera.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Japan has been fortunate in the distinction of its visiting writers. Many, including the likes of Rudyard Kipling, Edmund Blunden, Marguerite Yourcenar and Angela Carter, published memorable works inspired by their stays here. One figure who continues to enjoy affection among Japanophiles is Yorkshire-born travel writer and explorer Isabella Bird (1831-1904).,
,In the latter half of the 19th century, Bird was among a slowly emerging breed of women exiting the confines of the Victorian parlor, stepping through the garden gate and boarding steamers to distant lands. She was already an accomplished writer and seasoned traveler when she arrived in Tokyo in 1878, having explored the far reaches of the globe, traversing from the volcanoes of Hawaii to the Rocky Mountains of North America. Her ambitious trajectories are studied in meticulous detail by Kiyonori Kanasaka, author of “Isabella Bird and Japan: A Reassessment” and “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan: Revisiting Isabella Bird.”,
,An emeritus professor of Kyoto University and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Kanasaka is regarded as one of the world’s foremost scholars on Bird. When asked about his research approach, he says, “I pursued my Isabella Bird studies as a geographer. I believe a geographer who is interested in time and space is most fit to the science of travel and travel writing.”,
,
,His 2017 work, “Isabella Bird and Japan: A Reassessment,” is part analysis, critique and biography. Applying scrupulous research methods and a commitment to authenticity, it traces Bird’s itineraries, family circumstances and religious activities before coming to Japan. Bird may have been an open-minded and innovative travel writer, but when it came to religious convictions, she was very much a product of her time. Bird’s blind spot, in common with almost every Western visitor to Japan at the time, was an inability to recognize the ethical qualities of non-Christian faiths and people. Despite being exposed on her journeys throughout Japan to the fruits of an advanced society, she was still able to write, “The nation is sunk in immorality … her progress is political and intellectual rather than moral.” Bird could, however, also be gracious and bestow praise where she saw fit. “I believe there is no country in the world in which a lady can travel with such absolute security from danger and rudeness as in Japan,” she wrote.,Bird was primarily a documentarist, the opposite of a sentimental traveler. Confronted by her publisher, John Murray, who implored her to tone down her realist descriptions of poverty, disease and hardship, she responded that she intended to “de-cherry-blossom” Japan. At Murray’s request, however, Bird set about writing an abridged version of her original 1880 text. It’s not clear whether reducing the two-volume work to a form that would complement the publisher’s existing series of romantic travel adventures resulted in a satisfying outcome for the author, or a mutilation. From the reader’s perspective, the resulting work, “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,” is near flawless, with the reformatting in no way detracting from the literary quality of the text.,
,
,In terms of travel scope, there are considerable differences between the original volume and the new abridged edition presented by Kanasaka in his 2020 work, “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan: Revisiting Isabella Bird.” Where the original included trips to the Kansai region and the grand shrines at Ise, the shorter, subsequent book focuses on a northbound journey from Tokyo, through Nikko, Niigata and the remote reaches of Tohoku, before concluding in Hokkaido.,In Kanasaka’s author preface and commentaries, which precede Bird’s travelogue, he outlines some of his additions that make the work more accessible. These include a re-pivoting of the book’s orientation, emphasizing the centrality of her journey to the less-traveled north. Where comprehensive notes, annotations, commentary, footnotes and annotations might seem burdensome in lesser hands, Kanasaka’s expansions are indispensable for text enrichment. In both “Revisiting Isabella Bird” and “A Reassessment,” Kanasaka quotes some troubling sources of misinformation on Bird, from accounts in the Japanese press of the period, to an unsparing critique of the misinterpretations, fumbling of facts, and sloppy research by some of his academic contemporaries.,An early proponent of investigative travel, in which accounts were rendered in a refined and distinctive prose style, Bird’s work, notably in her Japan account, prefigured the now common term, “literary travel writing.” With the exception of major figures in the field, such as the Irish travel writer Dervla Murphy, there are few contemporary writers who can match Bird’s authorial quality, determination and sheer gumption.,These two beautifully paired and illustrated books would seem a satisfying coda, the last word on Isabella Bird studies. One suspects, however, that the author may have a good deal more to say on the subject.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Several observers have expressed disappointment at Asia’s “weak” response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including by ASEAN, India and Indonesia.,My old friend and astute observer of regional affairs, Brad Glosserman, added his voice in these pages recently. He noted that in the U.N. General Assembly’s overwhelming condemnation of Russia, many Asian countries — Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam — chose to abstain.,
,Let me stipulate upfront that Russia’s actions are illegal, immoral and possibly amount to war crimes. That will be of little consolation if Ukraine is reduced to ashes with tens of thousands killed or the world is incinerated in a nuclear war. Deleterious consequences for Australia, India and Japan include U.S. and European distraction from the Indo-Pacific, a stronger Moscow–Beijing axis and China as the big strategic victor of the NATO–Russia clash.,When India was a British colony, the U.K. defense strategy was to deny control of the reverse Himalayan slopes to any potential hostile power as that would confer immense strategic advantages to it. Tibet and Nepal served as critical buffer zones to this effect. After independence, India’s then-prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, ignored this inherited strategic wisdom, gave his blessing to China’s control of Tibet and paid the price in the military rout by China in the 1962 border war.,Similarly, if China were to conquer Taiwan, the geostrategic repercussions for Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and others would be grave. If China is engaged in a long game of displacing the U.S. as the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific and it’s a matter of when, not if, we choose to fight and not kowtow to it, the key question would be: Do we go to war as soon as China attacks, or delay and risk China’s relative power being still stronger down the line?,That effectively is the choice Vladimir Putin faced. Russia has had its nose rubbed repeatedly in the dirt of the former Soviet Union's historic defeat in the Cold War, its interests ignored, its buffer against NATO continually shrunk and its protests contemptuously dismissed. For reasons of history and geography, Russians regard the prospect of NATO troops in Ukraine as an existential threat. By contrast, it’s not part of core U.S. strategic interests and there will be no NATO planes over Ukraine nor boots on the ground.,There is unbroken continuity in the Russian grievance about NATO’s eastward expansion from Mikhail Gorbachev through Boris Yeltsin to Putin.,According to declassified documents from the National Security Archive published in 2017, there were multiple assurances to Soviet leaders from U.S., U.K., French and German leaders against NATO expansion that were then serially violated. The current CIA director, William Burns, was posted in Moscow when he wrote a memo in 1995, saying, “hostility to NATO expansion is almost universally felt across the domestic political spectrum here.” Burns returned to Moscow as ambassador and on Feb. 1, 2008, sent a cable to Washington (published by WikiLeaks) titled: “Nyet means nyet: Russia’s NATO enlargement red lines.”,Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned him that the issue of NATO membership for Ukraine “could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even civil war, which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene.” Despite the blunt warning, on April 3, 2008, NATO’s Bucharest Summit Declaration affirmed that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of NATO.”,Whenever this history of broken assurances is brought up, Americans get all lawyerly (“put it in writing”), just as they did in the Vietnam War vis-a-vis the 1954 Geneva Accords. They also ignore their own history of breaches of international law and principles: rejection of the World Court’s adverse verdict for the destabilization of Nicaragua in 1986, invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 and exit from the Iran nuclear deal. There are parallels between NATO actions in Kosovo in 1999 and Russian actions in Crimea in 2014; and between U.S. rejection of Cuba’s sovereign right to enter into a security alliance with the Soviet Union and station Soviet missiles in 1962 and Russian rejections of comparable rights asserted for Ukraine.,In a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February 2007 that filled many listeners with foreboding, Putin accused the West of breaking assurances on NATO expansion. In 2008 in Georgia and again in 2014 in Ukraine, he made it clear Russia had red lines that he would not allow NATO and the EU to cross. In his address to the nation on Feb. 24 announcing the military actions against Ukraine, Putin began by highlighting the threat posed by “the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.”,On March 2, the U.K. led 38 countries in a collective state referral to the ICC of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Yet on March 5, 2020, when the ICC authorized investigation of alleged war crimes in Afghanistan by the government, Taliban and U.S. forces since 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attacked the judgment as “reckless” and issued threats against ICC personnel.,Against this history, just because some Asian countries come to different conclusions based on their particular circumstances and priorities does not make them intellectual and moral inferiors.,Glosserman holds that “The invasion of Ukraine is such an egregious violation of international rules and norms that it is almost impossible for a government that aspires to international leadership or status, and certainly a U.S. ally, to not condemn Russia.” I respectfully disagree. India and Israel, for example, are among a handful of countries with good relations with both sides. Public condemnation would diminish India’s diplomatic potential to be an honest broker and God knows we might need skilled and credible interlocutors as tensions ratchet up in the coming days and weeks.,Great powers rise and fall on the tide of history. Although no power remains great forever and none retreats forever, there’s no way to reliably judge in real time whether a great power has begun its descent into permanent decline or is merely in temporary retreat.,Geopolitical fault lines during periods of power transition are fraught with grave risks of war rooted in miscalculations of relative power. Meanwhile, the fate of lesser powers caught in the crossfire of great power contests is as much determined by the outcome of those contests as by their own efforts.,The U.S. bet the house on the end-of-history thesis and the belief that Russia as a major power had permanently declined. Putin may well have made a fateful error in choosing war as the means to break out of the relentless strategic encirclement by NATO. If the invasion proves the American assessment right and destroys Russia’s pretensions to great power status, Putin will pay the ultimate price.,But if defeat in the Cold War was a cyclical blip in Russia’s great power status, then Ukraine’s NATO ambitions that were non-negotiable before the war will become negotiable. And the likes of India could well have a critical role to bring Europe and the world back from the brink.,Ramesh Thakur is emeritus professor in the Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University and a former United Nations assistant secretary general.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Project Syndicate,Instability is the new worldwide normal. From Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions in the Taiwan Strait to the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, the challenges the world faces are as varied as they are volatile. But, despite their transnational nature, building resilience to them must happen, first and foremost, within the confines of nation-states.,To be sure, effective multilateral cooperation has an important role to play. But intensifying geopolitical rivalries limit its potential. Moreover, even if countries did work together, their ability to address destabilizing global and regional trends and imbalances would depend substantially on the work that each country is doing to strengthen financial, economic and social resilience at home.,
,But there are plenty of barriers to effective national-level action. With public trust in government sagging in much of the world, few political leaders have the political mandate or legitimacy they need to make the difficult choices that the situation requires. Widespread mistrust of media does not help matters.,Rather than address these trust deficits in an honest and sustained way, many political leaders and journalists, particularly in the West, have sought to unite their populations by framing and highlighting external threats, especially with China and Russia. This is a dangerous distraction that arguably will leave the West less secure.,If countries remain on a war footing, they will dedicate insufficient attention and resources to domestic imperatives like meeting net-zero targets, bolstering demand, delivering quality health care, ensuring adequate social protections and reducing economic inequality. Without progress in these areas, discontent will only grow, undermining domestic, regional and global stability further.,China, for one, recognizes that attempting to address domestic challenges while fighting a “war of words” in the media and managing a cold war with the United States is a zero-sum game. With this in mind, in 2020 it introduced its “dual-circulation strategy,” focused on increasing China’s self-reliance and thus its ability to withstand external pressures and disruptions.,As China has begun to implement this strategy, it has also maintained a strict zero-COVID policy. This enabled it, most importantly, to keep total deaths low: Had China’s COVID-19 mortality rate matched that of the U.S., some 4 million Chinese would be dead. Instead, China recorded just a few thousand deaths from COVID-19.,Beyond saving lives, China’s zero-COVID policy enabled the country to avoid the economic drag of protracted national lockdowns, thereby facilitating a rapid recovery of production and consumption. This gave the government the confidence to implement structural-adjustment policies aimed at improving the quality of growth and advancing the goal of “common prosperity.”,For example, policymakers acted decisively to reduce risks in the real-estate sector and rein in internet-platform giants. While these reforms carried short-term costs — gross domestic product growth slowed to 4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 — full-year growth reached 8.1% (compared to 5.7% in the U.S.) and China’s current-account surplus stood at $315.7 billion (1.8% of GDP).,Further highlighting China’s commitment to addressing imbalances, the country’s macro leverage ratio (a measure of the economy’s overall indebtedness) has declined for five consecutive quarters. In 2021, the ratio fell by 7.7 percentage points, to 272.5%. For comparison, as of June 2021, the macro leverage ratio stood at 286.2% in the U.S., 416.5% in Japan and 284.3% in the eurozone.,Fiscal and monetary prudence also helped to ensure that the yuan’s value rose just 2.7% against the U.S. dollar in 2021, compared to 6.7% in 2020. Moreover, consumer prices climbed only 0.9% in 2021, compared to 7% in the U.S.,Producer prices did rise sharply in 2021, with annual growth peaking at 13.5% in October, owing to commodity-market volatility and supply-chain disruptions. But the government’s stabilization policies are already working to counteract this trend, reflected in the subsequent slowdown in producer price inflation, which stood at 9.1% in January.,And China is just getting started. In the quest for common prosperity, the government will continue to use a combination of market incentives and fiscal transfers both to expand the economic pie sustainably and to ensure that gains are allocated more fairly. Voluntary charitable contributions will also make a difference here.,A second priority is to achieve a more balanced and disciplined use of capital, with the help of both incentives (such as to bolster productivity growth) and regulations (to protect against speculative practices or monopoly prices). As part of this effort, China is encouraging the use of long-term equity capital, instead of debt.,China’s government is also working to secure adequate supplies of strategic natural resources, energy, commodities, industrial materials and agricultural products, to shield itself against a hostile geopolitical environment. Furthermore, it is improving its systems for predicting, managing and mitigating major financial or nonfinancial risks, including low-probability, high-impact Black Swan events and slow-moving Grey Rhino risks like climate change and biodiversity loss. And it remains committed to reaching a carbon-emissions peak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.,It is an ambitious agenda and success is not guaranteed. China’s own track record shows that, in devising and implementing bold policies, missteps are inevitable. But China also has a long history of learning from its mistakes and adapting to changing conditions. In any case, at a time of profound uncertainty and open hostility, China has little choice but to prepare for the worst. Fortunately for the rest of the world, whatever progress China makes in addressing internal imbalances will only bolster global stability.,Andrew Sheng, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong, is a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.

			,Central to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s calculations as he weighed the invasion of Ukraine was a belief that he would encounter an enfeebled and divided West. It was a reasonable expectation given political developments in those countries in recent months and the seeming discord that surfaced among them as they studied his preparations. He was wrong, however.,The West, and virtually the entire world, has united to oppose the invasion of Ukraine. While many leaders deserve credit for helping to forge this coalition, a good deal of the credit goes to U.S. President Joe Biden, who has demonstrated remarkable acuity in handling this crisis.,
,He and his team overcame deep fissures in U.S. domestic politics to build that international front, wrong-footed Putin and prevailed in the information war. Biden is laying out the terms for a new era in international relations, one that he believes will be defined by the struggle between democracy and authoritarian governments.,While there was considerable public debate and great skepticism about Putin’s intentions, the U.S. has been steadfast in its insistence that an invasion was planned. To great risk, the U.S. revealed intelligence that burned off the cloud of doubt and confusion that Moscow hoped to use to win the information war and denied Russia the advantage of surprise.,Biden and his team used that intelligence and a calibrated strategic approach to engage allies and partners, and to identify and pursue the consensus that would unify the West in response to any aggression. Working behind the scenes, Washington has let other governments move at their own pace: For example, Europe was first to announce that Russian banks would be barred from the SWIFT financial messaging system. The result has been the creation of a coalition that not only surprised Putin, but many in the West as well. It has strengthened NATO and burnished its appeal to other European countries.,His team has worked with the Japanese government to ensure that it is part of this coalition. While condemnation of the invasion was obligatory, joining the sanctions effort was not. Tokyo has traditionally been slow to use sanctions, insisting instead on the need to maintain channels of communication with target countries.,This logic has been especially useful when dealing with Putin, with whom even conservative politicians engaged in hopes of reaching a solution to the Northern Territories dispute. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was one of the few Western leaders to attend the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, held as another crisis brewed in Ukraine, one that would result in the annexation of Crimea.,The speed with which all parties agreed on sanctions and the severity of those measures is an example of the success of Biden’s strategy. The shocking shift in German security policy — announcing that Berlin will send military weapons to Ukraine and that it will increase defense spending by €100 billion this year and reach the goal of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense — is another. The stunning United Nations General Assembly vote of 141-5 against the invasion is yet another.,These achievements are even more impressive given the damage that his predecessor Donald Trump did to U.S. alliances, multilateralism and the rules-based order. The most important lesson of the last week has been that international cooperation and coordinated action in pursuit of shared values and principles are essential to the survival of that order and to the peace and security it creates. The protection of national interests is best achieved through cooperative actions, not myopic or narrowly defined nationalism.,Just as important has been Biden’s restraint. He made clear before the invasion began that the U.S. would not commit military forces. He has talked tough, but he has not drawn intemperate red lines. When Putin brandished his nuclear arsenal in a seeming warning that he was prepared to use those weapons, the U.S. by contrast canceled a planned missile test to avoid any risk of an accident.,And throughout the crisis, Biden has focused attention on where it belongs. He has applauded the heroism and resilience of the Ukrainian people and condemned Putin for his aggression. He has not made it about himself or put himself at the center of the unfolding crisis.,Instead, he has framed this as a struggle between the forces of good and evil, as when he closed his State of the Union address in Washington Tuesday evening by noting that “Now is the hour. Our moment of responsibility. Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged … . We will save democracy.”,For 70 years, the world has looked to the U.S. for leadership in international crises. In recent years, there has been growing doubt about both the capacity and the will of the U.S. president to play that role.,These questions have arisen as power within the world is being redistributed: Indeed, that shift is driving some of the concern. New divisions of labor and responsibility are needed; some are being created. But there remains a critical need for leadership, albeit leadership of a new kind. The world is fortunate to have Biden in the White House as it grapples with a world in transition.,The Japan Times Editorial Board,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,A lot of us know what it’s like to clock in for work each day and think, “I don’t know if I can make it through another day here.” Needless to say, this is a good sign that it’s time to consider finding a new job.,For the mid-career professional, however, deciding to job hunt again can be a hesitant choice. Combine that hesitation with being a non-Japanese resident during a global pandemic, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for some serious anxiety.,
,This list is designed to help you organize your thoughts if you have recently been thinking about changing jobs in Japan., This is an important question if the reason for your job change is a dislike of the industry you are currently in. However, although not impossible, reinventing yourself is easier said than done. Companies in Japan don’t often take hiring risks, which leads most job changers to keep doing what they are doing — just for a different employer. Still, you need to know the source of your dissatisfaction in order to make the right choice for your life, and it could be your current field.,However, horizontal moves to other job fields can be more difficult than moving vertically in the company or field you’re already in. So, if you’ve spent seven years as an English teacher but recently took a coding course, the Japanese job market is likely to disappoint you if you’re wanting to move into IT — ,.,The takeaway here is that you should understand your market value and understand your limitations. Be patient when seeking employment outside of your current career track., During the pandemic we’ve seen reports saying Japan’s job market is , and ,, only to later read that , than was previously hoped. This may have you wondering when the best time would be to enter the job-hunting market.,Worrying about “when” is far less important than educating yourself about “what,” however. Scanning job boards, filling out spontaneous applications, taking casual interviews in your free time and asking around your network for job leads are entirely harmless, and experts say they’re actually a healthy part of having a professional career. Always having an eye open for the dream job is the only way to spot it. “Now” is always a good time to look., If you’ve been in Japan for a while as a professional worker, you know that when engaging in , (changing jobs), ,. The human resource offices of thousands of top companies have deeply entrenched relationships with recruitment agencies in Japan, and for high-skilled, experienced, fully bilingual workers, recruiters can bring you job opportunities on a silver platter.,However, many workers naturally fall outside of many recruitment firm’s coverage, usually by being a professional in a creative or artistic field. It may be less beneficial for musicians, artists, journalists or actors to ring up most recruitment agents in Japan. These kinds of professionals tend to rely on traditional networking and want-ads on the many Japanese internet job boards, which, when used correctly, can be just as effective in seeking new employment. They include: ,, ,, ,, , (best for Japanese natives), , and ,.,Consider what is right for you., The reason you may not be feeling good in your job might be that you’re just not that into Tokyo anymore. Depending on your industry, and your financial means, it can be entirely possible to relocate to the countryside as a remote worker, and the government even ,.,Beyond remote work opportunities, ,, it’s common for English-language teachers and mechanical engineers to be able to find work in the far flung regions of Japan that need foreign-language education personnel and industrial professionals to help their shrinking communities stay relevant in the ongoing Japanese migration to urban areas., This is a difficult question for many of us. If you have lived here for a long time then you will likely find it hard to entertain the idea of leaving. For some of us, though, Japan has a shelf-life. If you are miserable at your current job and struggle to find many other job opportunities in Japan — particularly if it’s because of your language skills — then it may be the case that an overseas company can offer you the next step in your career.,Sure, deciding to leave Japan comes with its own headaches: moving during a pandemic with all the new regulations that entails, sorting out your visa, pension, taxes, apartment, bills and potentially much more. Changing jobs is a serious life choice with lasting implications for your future, so these headaches could be worth suffering though if it makes the most sense for your career. When considering a job change, the question of leaving Japan should always be on the table.,And, it’s not out of the question that you’ll be able to return. Many expats come back to Japan after some time abroad and a lot of them tend to appreciate it even more after they’ve been away for some time.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Japan is often touted as an expensive place to live. With a high quality of living, national health system, vibrant cultural scene, admirable levels of education and safety — it’s not hard to understand some of the reasons why people want to call it home. These desirable factors come at a cost, though.,The nation’s capital was recently revealed as the world’s third most-expensive city to be an expat in, according to the ,. It ranked just below Hong Kong and Ashgabat. But don’t be fooled by big claims that living in Japan, or even Tokyo, will break the bank. Like any location around the globe, there are ways to cut down on living expenses without compromising your lifestyle.,
,The impact of COVID-19 on daily lives and the economy has also changed the way we spend. Many have had their livelihoods affected, with the tourism industry, entertainment and nightlife all but decimated; job losses due to the pandemic have led to many feeling the pinch. Saving money now is perhaps more important than ever.,Looking for ways to live in Japan on a budget is about being savvy with where you spend your cash. Here are some tried and tested tips and tricks to cut back on your expenses and get those yen working for themselves.,
,The price of food and everyday items varies hugely from shop to shop. Tokyu Stores might be right opposite (or even in) your station, but that is a convenience you pay for with steep price points. Similarly, the luxury of choice afforded by fancy stores like Precce and the admittedly more economical Aeon Style means paying handsomely for the privilege.,Buying the basics at cheaper chains can result in saving a pretty penny on your purchases. Popular budget supermarkets include Gyomu Super and Hanamasa; these may not be the sleek supermarkets of your dreams, but they’re relatively cheap and actually used by small restaurants to keep their stocks replenished. Because of this they sell international basics such as pasta and bread for a snip, as well as ingredients for Mexican dishes and curries — often in bulk.,But there’s a catch. Gyomu and its ilk often carry more expensive fruits and vegetables than the larger chain stores, and this is where shopping around comes into play. Basic items — your onions, carrots and potatoes — can be picked up cheaply in places such as Life and Aeon.,
,
,Don’t overlook local , (greengrocer) joints either. These mainstays of , (shopping streets) and suburban neighborhoods are a top spot for picking up fresh produce for low prices; since they specialize in fruit and vegetables you may find things that your supermarket is lacking, plus you’ll be supporting a small independent business. Be warned: Much like turnip prices in “Animal Crossing,” real life fruit and veg prices fluctuate on the daily in Japan. Around New Year’s and other seasonal breaks price gouging does occur, so it’s wise to plan ahead.,Take full advantage of evening reductions at supermarkets when sushi or , (side dishes) are marked down, sometimes at half the price or more. Work out the time your local supermarket starts reducing their freshly made meals and you’ll be in for a treat. Learn the kanji for half price, , (半額) which is often pasted on packaging or signs.,Living outside of the cities can also mean far fewer options in terms of supermarkets and yaoya. A tip I picked up when living in the , (countryside) was to get my groceries delivered weekly. This way I was able to save on the cost of transport and keep an eye on my spending by planning meals in advance.,
,Finding the extra cash you budget for entertainment isn’t always easy — the cost quickly adds up. Tickets for events can be expensive, as can meals in , (Japanese pubs), cinema tickets and weekends away, but treating yourself in your downtime doesn’t need to cost the Earth.,Museums in Tokyo and across the country usually have reduced-rate and free days throughout the year, some of them at least once a month. Check websites for when those are.,However, not all museums and art galleries charge entrance; there’s a whole selection of cultural centers where you can easily while away an hour or two free of charge. These include , and ,, an arts and cultural center set in a former junior high school. Similarly, city views can be found for free at observation decks in multiple skyscrapers across the land: there’s , (Setagaya, Tokyo); , in Bancho, Niigata; and the 16th-floor garden of , in Osaka, to name a few.,Festivals are another free activity that you can join in with. These happen throughout the year in towns and cities and can help you ingratiate with Japanese culture. For example, it costs nothing to join in at a ,, the cyclical dance at o-Bon festivals in summer. Also in the warmer months, parks and green spaces across the country become hangouts for people of all ages. Ease into the parklife: lay out a rug, bring a frisbee (or a book) and spend a free afternoon soaking up the local life.,Another option is to simply make the most of interesting historical sights and architecture by taking yourself on a walk; plan your route on a maps app and spend the day hitting up locations that pique your interest. Local councils will also often provide free maps with walks around interesting sites in the area, often along routes marked with signs or tiles. Being creative with the way you spend your money on entertainment can pay dividends.,
,Traveling around Japan’s urban areas is not cheap, but there are clever ways to streamline how much you pay for a trip.,Before you hop on a train, check Google maps for different routes. The cost of the trip is shown in yen for each route suggested; you can also change your search preferences to include cheaper routes. Sometimes, depending on where you’re traveling to, you can save tens or hundreds on a journey. It all adds up. If you have time on longer journeys, opt for slower local trains instead of shinkansen and save yourself thousands.,
,
,Riding the train is not always the best option. In fact, city buses can get you from A to B for a flat fare: ¥210 (¥206 with an IC card) in Tokyo can ferry you practically all the way across the city on some routes. Again, checking a maps app can help with planning. Traveling on the reliable , for long distances will also save you a whole stack of cash when compared to the shinkansen. Night buses can even save on accommodation for the night: the average fare for a night bus from Tokyo to Osaka, for example, is around ¥3,500.,For traveling locally, using pedal power will really save you time and money. Secondhand bikes can be picked up for a low rate, or , gives the option of using electric bikes to get around town.,
,Across the country loyalty schemes are king. Peek into anybody’s wallet and they’ll be crammed full of various plastic cards for different supermarkets, coupons for restaurants and loyalty cards for coffee shops. These money-saving tactics are a big deal in Japan and are well worth spending some of your time researching and investing in.,It’s possible to be deftly savvy. Using specific bank cards or prepaid chargeable point cards at the correct food joints and , (convenience stores) means you’ll tot up a healthy balance of T-Points, Nanaco points and a whole array of other points to get cash off purchases. Loyalty really is rewarded.,Don’t turn down stamp or , (sticker) cards at your local coffee shop or bakery, either. There are also coupons that will give you money off bowls of udon, free drink at cafes or half-price meals at family restaurants. Check online for the latest deals and see if you can save; download apps for your favorite haunts and open up a world of coupons.,
,One of the biggest expenses of any monthly budget is bills. Electricity, gas, water, internet, phone: There’s no getting away from it. In the winter months, electricity bills can soar as we all try to keep cozy in the cold weather. Using an AC unit is one of the most common but more expensive ways to heat your living space. However, you can cut costs by using eco mode, making sure the vents point down, keeping the temperature at 20 degrees Celsius and using a floor fan to move the warm air around. More energy friendly ways to stay warm include using a , or a heated carpet, both of which are some of the most cost-effective ways to stay warm: One study suggests that these cost an estimated ¥4.3 and ¥9 per hour, respectively, to run.,In the sweltering height of summer, air conditioning is a must. It’s also a surefire way to hike up an expensive energy bill. Try to use it only when it’s needed, and use tactical ways of staying cool like taking brief cold showers, strategic fan placement and opening windows when temperatures cool down. Use a timer for the aircon so it turns off once you go to sleep.,When it comes to drying clothes, hang them up to dry outside. Because of dry winter air and sunny days, clothes can dry outside during the freezing depths of Japan’s winter months; you’ll be saving a whole lot of money on energy bills and doing your bit to help the planet, too.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Clickbait headlines like “Get a free house in the Japanese countryside!” have popped up over the past several years — and while the idea of moving into an old home in bucolic rural Japan sounds amazing in theory, the reality is more complex. Nonetheless, a number of factors have collided recently to create unique opportunities in the housing market for foreign residents of Japan.,
,Japan’s slowly but steadily rising prices, openness to foreign investors, excellent architects and infrastructure for house building — and an increase of resources and agencies for acquiring ,, or abandoned, often ultra-cheap homes — have combined to make Japan an attractive environment for non-Japanese looking to acquire real estate, be it a primary home, secondary home or investment.,According to reporting on ,, Japan house prices increased 0.8% in 2020 year over year, a shockingly modest increase compared to other highly developed countries — for example, , in the U.S. in 2020. And while the pandemic has weakened demand overall, Alex Toyoda at ,, a Tokyo-based real estate company, says that while foreigners are scarce due to the pandemic, the market hasn’t changed much due to the increasing demands of wealthy Japanese.,“Shutting the borders completely closed off foreigners from entering the country,” Toyoda says. “But to our surprise, the market for expats has barely changed because of the increasing demand from Japanese. And where we’ve lost expats in the rental market, the buying and selling market has been very strong.”,Some buyers have turned toward searching for larger homes with an extra bedroom for an office or a pet-friendly apartment, but the overall market hasn’t drastically altered.,“Residential property lending has not skipped a beat and has been very healthy throughout the pandemic,” confirms Adam German at ,, a guide to Tokyo real estate.,On the other hand, COVID-19 has caused rents in the struggling hospitality, restaurant and retail industries to decrease, but most housing markets have remained largely unharmed by the pandemic.,“Housing focused on foreigners is a unique, high-end industry,” Toyoda says. “Most of the buyers are looking for their own homes, seeking a better environment. Most people are focused on Japanese housing not for the investment, but for themselves.”,Since implementation in 2012, the reflationary policies of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, known as “Abenomics,” have buoyed the housing market. As a result, the market has seen modest price growth, changing Japanese real estate from a deflationary asset to a growing one. The change has spurred investments in Japanese real estate from wealthy investors throughout Asia.,
,Japanese and specifically Tokyo real estate prices are very low compared to those of cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore and London, so buyers from wealthy countries have taken advantage of Japan’s relatively low real estate prices and high yields. A weaker yen has also encouraged foreign buyers. (Since 2012, one dollar has gone from ¥80 to nearly ¥110.),“Ninety percent of wealthy Asian clients buy as an investment,” says Mitsuo Hashimoto at ,, another Tokyo-based real estate firm. “There’s a lot of interest in high-rise buildings in central Tokyo. This central market used to be dominated by expats, but after the market crash in 2008, more wealthy Japanese started to move into the market, especially with stocks and prices increasing since 2012. It’s a healthy rise — not like a bubble.”,Hashimoto also notes that many foreign companies stopped paying moving expenses for expats after ’08 and turned to hiring foreign workers that were already based in Japan. This has led to more expats renting and buying outside of central Tokyo and moving further into the suburbs.,“I still recommend our clients to buy as central as they can, because those residences will appreciate the most in value,” Hashimoto says.,While prices and demand in the housing market have remained steady and slowly growing in recent years, residential construction has plunged, mostly due to Japan’s massive supply glut. An extremely limited supply of the types of housing preferred by many non-Japanese — larger, more spacious, open-plan homes — has further forced expat renters and buyers farther out of central Tokyo.,“The supply is very scarce for top-end properties, while there’s an endless supply of smaller studios,” Toyoda says. “Construction just isn’t fast enough to meet the demand.”,
,
,Still, the Tokyo market has managed to avoid some of the disastrous housing trends that have struck other major cities.,“If you look at New York, London and Singapore, you have foreign buyers paying very high prices, so prices in the central area go up because of foreign investors,” says Hashimoto. This trend has notably led to gentrification and displacement of locals.,But Hashimoto says he doesn’t see the same trend manifesting in Tokyo, even as more investors capitalize on Tokyo real estate. “Central Tokyo is very large compared to central Hong Kong or New York City. I think the market will still be dominated by local people in Tokyo.”,The current picture of the Japanese housing market is a lot of hustle and bustle around the top, high-end properties, and a massive supply glut for the rest. And while the focus of real estate companies remains at a high-income level — expats, Asian investors and wealthy Japanese — the supply glut presents opportunities for Japan’s large middle class, as well.,“The middle class has arguably been the least affected by recent real estate trends,” says Hashimoto, “since those employed at big companies have stable salaries and protection.”,
, are one such opportunity. With the population of Japan in decline, there is a surplus of abandoned homes around the country. The Japanese government has started to put some abandoned houses and apartments back on the market and, in 2017, , to make vacant homes available to rent, but the initiative failed to attract homeowners. Still, companies and services have emerged as of late to help prospective buyers take advantage of these homes.,“(Akiya) started as a quirky thing which was then proven viable, then somewhat desirable, then recently valuable with the onset of coronavirus,” says Matt Ketchum of ,, a real estate company focused on akiya and rural homes.,The biggest challenge, besides the state of disrepair that many of these homes have fallen into, is that often, akiya do not have updated legal heirs. If the title deed to a house shows someone who was born in the 19th century, chasing down their legal descendants and buying the property can prove to be practically impossible.,“The main reason why attractive akiya don’t move is because they’re locked away behind an anachronistic bureaucratic system that is generally impenetrable to the layperson,” Ketchum says. “So once we find you something that looks nice … engage professional services unless you are extremely confident in your ability to navigate rural real estate agencies’ idiosyncratic methods.”,Companies like Akiya & Inaka and government initiatives such as the Akiya Bank Program have started to turn akiya from an idea into a reality. Experts recommend using exclusively established listings to ensure that a house is actually available for sale and doing extremely thorough due diligence.,Ketchum says that the pandemic has further helped spark interest in these homes. Compared to the high expenses and long time frame of building a custom home, akiya can realistically come in at under ¥20 million.,“Then there are the health, financial, workstyle and lifestyle benefits of extricating oneself from the city center,” says Ketchum. As resources continue to increase for akiya, they appear to be a viable option for foreign residents with either lower budgets or greater flexibility, especially as support for purchasing them continues to rise.,
,For those with larger budgets or more specific requirements for their home, Japan’s expansive house-building industry presents exciting opportunities for foreign residents. Ryoma Katsura, CEO and founder of ,, a company that specializes in connecting foreigners with Japanese architects, says that the quality and flexibility provided by Japanese architects has made house-building an attractive option for foreign residents who are settling down in Japan for the long term.,“Clients are usually very satisfied with architects’ understanding of what they want and creativity and expertise in realizing it,” Katsura says. “People want to build their houses in Japan with all their wishes assembled together as places to live in that they love.”,, a retirement advisor focusing on foreign residents at ,, says that it is important for foreigners to differentiate buying a home from buying real estate for investment purposes.,“While land can hold its value, many homes end up worthless or with negative value,” Tanaka says.,However, he points out that Japanese financing options make buying a smart financial decision for people settling down in one place for the long term.,“Because of low interest rates, a mortgage will often be a lower monthly payment than rent, for a more comfortable/luxurious home. If you are able to live in the same home for decades … you will pay less and enjoy a higher standard of living. However, every time you move you will pay transaction costs of 5-10%, as well as seeing the value of the building go down.”,The Japanese housing market, while presenting unique opportunities, also has distinct challenges for foreign residents. For example, there is the ever-surprising key money for rentals, an extra fee that serves as a gift to the owner. There are also “right of residence” laws that heavily protect renters. These laws mean that owners tend to have extremely stringent requirements and background checks for renters, which has led to widespread housing discrimination against non-Japanese. In the buying market, those purchasing apartments should conduct thorough due diligence because , has shown that some real estate companies do not disclose information about land quality and severely underestimate the cost for repairs and maintenance.,Overall, slow but steady market growth and a wealth of resources make the current housing market attractive for foreign residents.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

How-tos,,"Renting, building or renovating: Tips to get the best roof over your head","

			,Contributing writer,Anyone staying in Japan on a short- or long-term basis needs a roof over their head. Residents have two basic options — rent accommodation or purchase property, with the latter option offering the possibility of renovating an older home to bring it up to the standards of modern living, especially in terms of insulation.,
,Obviously, a lot can be said about any of these choices. Just remember that all three options mentioned below have pitfalls associated with them, and how well you navigate your final decision may ultimately determine how well you enjoy your time in Japan.,
,Japan’s housing market is flooded with an abundance of small, one-bedroom apartments. On the plus side, this means that prices are low, and there’s no need to share with a roommate. On the flip side, however, this also means there’s a shortage of the more spacious, multiroom apartments foreign residents tend to prefer.,“With the number of expats increasing and the number of properties decreasing, foreigners have now been going into the suburbs because they cannot find homes in their favorite areas,” says Alex Toyoda at Tokyo-based real estate company ,.,Many of these single-bedroom apartments can be found in central neighborhoods. However, those looking for larger family homes will be faced with a much smaller, more limited market, located farther away from their offices and favorite weekend haunts. Many will be tempted to downsize their living expectations in order to save a little money on rent and live in the best possible location.,One of the biggest differences when renting in Japan compared to other countries is that the government has passed a number of strict laws that protect tenants. For the most part, owners essentially cannot kick tenants out and, as a result, anyone renting accommodation will probably have to go through a very stringent screening process before being offered a tenancy contract. Some owners have used this system to discriminate against foreign tenants (which I’ll discuss in more detail in the next installment).,Many experts recommend using an agency that specializes in renting to foreign tenants, as they know which properties do and do not accept non-Japanese.,“You’ll have to submit all kinds of documents when applying,” Toyoda says. “It’s difficult to get in, but once you’re in your apartment, you’re protected by law.”,There are several factors to consider when looking for an apartment.,Orientation is critical and south-facing apartments are by far the most in-demand, offering space to dry futons all year round as well as savings on electricity for heating, laundry, lighting and more.,Construction materials also make a big difference in sound insulation in apartment complexes with a lot of people living in them. Concrete is much better for noise insulation compared to wood or steel. Experts also recommend checking for mold, which can become a serious threat during Japan’s humid summers.,
,Japan’s large construction market provides foreign residents with sizable budgets plenty of opportunity to build a home.,This begins with a search for land, which Ryoma Katsura, CEO and founder of ,, a company that specializes in connecting foreign buyers with Japanese architects, says can often be the most challenging part of the process.,“It’s important to get a professional involved early, because you never know when the land you want pops up,” Katsura says. “Things get sold really quickly.”,Three types of people can design your homes: individual architects, large construction companies and local builders.,The latter two can have faster timelines and offer some level of cost-savings, but invariably provide less customization.,By comparison, individual architects can offer more flexibility and have a better understanding of what non-Japanese clients are looking for in their homes.,“If Japanese people have space, they tend to build a wall and turn it into another room to prioritize functionality,” Katsura says. “That doesn’t necessarily fit other culture’s priorities.”,Katsura says many of his firm’s non-Japanese clients tend to be satisfied with their Japanese architects. For example, Japanese houses often use wood in ways that aren’t common in many other countries, while rooftop balconies have become a popular solution for those seeking open space within the confines of a Japanese home.,“Japanese architecture and design tends to be very modern, but simple, and sophisticated,” Katsura says. “Architects are also very knowledgeable about the seasons, designing houses to maximize heating and cooling with various approaches, including choosing the right materials and structures or placing windows and eaves in the most optimal way.”,It’s important to note that financing and mortgage options will depend on your residency status. In addition, having to navigate language barriers can pose issues, but that’s where professionals can assist as facilitators.,
,Japan is believed to have more than 8 million empty homes (,) nationwide.,While you might come across empty homes in your neighborhood that pique your interest, they’re actually very difficult to acquire in the first place as it’s often hard to track down the owner.,Keeping an eye on established portals such as the Akiya Bank Program is probably the best approach and, as more companies start to specialize in selling empty homes, the number of options can only increase.,Parker Allen, co-founder of ,, a real estate company specializing in empty homes, sees long-term potential in the marketplace.,“Just last year it was announced that UNESCO would recognize Japanese architectural craftsmanship as an intangible heritage, and for good reason,” Allen says. “The , technique, which is Japan’s traditional and primary building technique for wooden structures, is extremely solid and can stand the test of time.”,On the downside, such engineering techniques mean that possibilities for design are more limited.,“We advise clients that they need to be comfortable with the current floor plan and overall design,” Allen says.,What empty homes lack in design possibilities, they often make up for in craftsmanship — not to mention the huge cost-savings compared to custom builds.,One of the most important factors to consider when looking for an empty home to renovate is a desire to relocate to a more rural location. And once the renovation work on the home has been completed, more work is still needed to ensure foreign residents are able to live in these communities according to Matt Ketchum, co-founder of Akiya & Inaka.,“It starts with removing barriers to entry from curious, creative individuals from all walks of life,” he says, “encouraging them to experiment as they see fit and with the support of local communities.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,When Yoshihide Suga declared in October that Japan would be carbon neutral by 2050, he became the first Japanese prime minister to set a specific timeline in the country’s bid to become emissions free.,As ambitious as Suga’s pledge may be, it’s far from being a pipe dream. The world is slowly taking concrete steps to address the climate crisis, and Japan simply can ill afford to sit on the sidelines any longer.,
,Japan is as vulnerable to climate change as any other country in the world. Its 2019 typhoon season was the costliest on record, closely followed by 2018. What’s more, scorching heat waves hospitalized thousands across the country in 2018 and 2019, while record rainfall in this period forced millions to evacuate from their homes.,“Typhoons that are supposed to (make landfall) only once in 100 years seem to be striking Japan every year,” says Soma Kondo, a spokesperson for Climate Youth Japan. “I think any more damage will have the entire country concerned about global warming.”,Many of these aspects of climate change are no longer projections, but realities. In 2018, the Environment Ministry reported that annual temperatures recorded in Japan are, than the global average — and that the archipelago gets an extra day of “heat wave” weather once every five years. The report noted more days of heavy precipitation, fewer days of rain overall and a snow depth reduction of about 13% per decade.,
,
,It has recently become evident just how deep the consequences of climate change run in Japan, cutting deeply into the fabric of the country’s economy and society. The economic consequences of the climate crisis in Japan include storms that bring ruin to local infrastructure and businesses, and climate-related agricultural damage to pillars of regional economies and cultural pride such as rice, fresh produce and seafood.,The most dramatic consequence of the climate crisis comes in the form of increased rainfall and powerful typhoons. Annual instances of extreme precipitation in Japan have ,, and it has certainly felt that way: Between Typhoon Lan in 2017, Typhoon Jebi in 2018, Typhoon Hagibis in 2019, and torrential rain that caused millions to evacuate in western Japan in 2018 and Kyushu in 2017, 2019 and 2020, the impact has been nothing short of devastating. In 2019, damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis exceeded ¥1.8 trillion, a record for a water-caused natural disaster that wasn’t related to a tsunami. The previous record was the heavy rain recorded in Okayama and western Japan in 2018.,“Everything (is at risk),” says Miguel Esteban, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Waseda University. “From an engineering point of view, it would probably be better to move everybody out of this country and resettle them elsewhere.”,Tropical storms form as a consequence of heat and so, generally speaking, the hotter the weather, the, Studies, global warming has increased the proportion of severe tropical storms around the world.,
,
,Most of the economic damage during such storms occurs to infrastructure and buildings. Last summer, , killed 64, forced 200,000 residents to evacuate, caused 105 rivers to overflow, 316 mudslides, and, according to Kumamoto prefecture, monetary damage of more than ¥556 billion. The area around the Kuma River was particularly hard-hit, with houses and bridges being swept away.,“Heavy rain in Kumamoto in recent years has caused major floods and landslides,” says Toshio Fujimi, a professor of engineering at Kumamoto University’s Center for Water Cycle, Marine Environment and Disaster Management. “As a result, we have seen heavy damage to major roads and agriculture by sediment flowing into farmland, as well as the destruction of dams and reservoirs.”,There is also a ripple effect on local businesses and the local economy. In November 2019, Nikkei, had significantly disrupted the tourist season in Hakone, cutting off mountain railway services as well as spring water to hotels and inns. Fujimi anticipates that Kumamoto will suffer from the same problem, as tourists shy away from visiting disaster-struck regions.,Even the temporary suspension of a bullet train can cast a long shadow over local economies in the nearby region.,“Tourist numbers have been slow to recover, even after the bullet train resumed operation,” Tateki Ataka, president of Hokkoku Bank in Ishikawa, told Nikkei Asia after Hagibis. “It seems that tourists remain reluctant to make trips as the impact of the typhoon lingers.”,
,
,And while rising sea levels in Japan don’t pose an immediate problem to many of the country’s residents, the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that, to protect infrastructure and coastlines against a 1-meter rise in sea levels. And, as if that’s not enough, replacing infrastructure that is damaged by storms every year is difficult enough without having to set financial resources aside to fight COVID-19.,“The river flood defenses in Tokyo are currently being upgraded to withstand 1-in-200-year events,” Esteban says. “Adaptation is much cheaper than leaving things vulnerable.”,In a 2016 study, Esteban and his team calculated that the cost of inaction could exceed ¥100 trillion in damage, compared to the ¥370 billion investment required to upgrade Tokyo’s infrastructure to defend the city against storm surges and rising sea levels.,
,
,The climate crisis has also already led to changes for some of Japan’s most important agricultural products — first and foremost, rice.,When growing rice, high temperatures can cause white immature grain as well as cracked grain by reducing starch production and breaking apart the husk. The Environment Ministry reported that cases of both white immature grain and cracked grain have been increasingly seen around Japan — as well as a reduction in yield in unusually warm years. As early as 2012, 25 prefectures had already reported an increase in rice grain damage.,JA Oita, the regional cooperative of farms in Oita Prefecture, says that high temperatures and irregular, but extreme, rainfall have combined to make last year extremely poor in terms of a rice yield.,“The quality of the rice has deteriorated because the night temperature does not drop due to global warming,” says Yasunori Hitomi, a representative from JA Oita. “The number of ears of rice is also decreasing because of less rainfall overall. As a result, the rice-crop index of Oita Prefecture last year was 77, compared to the national average of 98.”,Extreme heat’s effects on rice quality and yields can have knock-on business consequences. When actual shipments don’t match the projected yields, the balance of supply and demand is disrupted, causing over- or under-supply and unexpected competition between different regions.,“We haven’t been able to make shipments according to our plan, so our prices won’t rise,” Hitomi says.,Projections suggest that 30% decreases in rice yields for most of Japan outside of Hokkaido and Tohoku are possible in the next 50 years.,Rising temperatures are also having consequences on fruit. The Environment Ministry has reported that high temperatures and low summer precipitation has caused damage to grapes, apples, persimmons, oranges and peaches., showed that negative effects of high temperatures have been observed in Nagano Prefecture, and predicted that the climate would be too warm to grow apples in the country by 2060. Farmers cited in the study were particularly concerned in the short-term over paler colored apples, which drastically lower prices, since the Japanese market highly values colorful fruit. Nagano farmers described earlier blooming as well as higher fall temperatures, later frosts and more hail storms — events all linked to the climate crisis.,Katsutoshi Osanai of JA Aomori says that high September and October temperatures are inhibiting the ripening of their apples and even burning the fruit.,“We haven’t seen large impacts on our vegetables yet, but the mild winter snowfalls … (are) definitely a different climate from the old Aomori Prefecture,” Osanai says.,Storms can also bring devastation to farmers, such as when, to crops such as rice, apples and cucumbers.,
,
,The climate crisis is further beginning to have effects on Japan’s fisheries. Jorge Molinos, a professor at the Arctic Research Center at Hokkaido University, who studies the effects of the climate crisis on the marine ecosystem, says that climate change is causing a rapid reorganization of marine life by relocating species within warming oceans.,Japan’s unique geography puts temperate waters in contact with tropical waters. Fish are sensitive to changes in temperature, so tropical species are pushing north.,“Tropical herbivorous fish, which are arriving in increasing numbers to the temperate costs of Shikoku or Kyushu are putting extra pressure on temperate seaweed, posing a serious threat to these valuable ecosystems,” Molinos says. “The tropicalization in Japan has many faces, like the expansion of tropical coral reefs … or the population decline of temperate species.”,Challenges for the fishing industry have emerged all over the country, from Hokkaido’s salmon, Pacific saury and squid catches to the disappearance of abalone and anchovies in Tokyo Bay. While difficult to link directly to climate change, the salmon catch has, in the past 15 years.,“The fishing industry is very concerned,” says Shinichi Ito, a professor at the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at Tokyo University. “Higher water temperatures are causing problems for nori and ,(seaweed).”,Large-scale losses of seaweed cultivation grounds were previously observed in Kyushu and Yamaguchi Prefecture in 2013. Then, in last year’s summer, local divers and fishers in, Tropical reefs were first confirmed in Kanto waters as recently as 2007.,“With the loss of the seaweed beds, large abalone, which were our local specialty, died out,” Koichi Hirashima, head of a local fisher’s association tells Kyodo News. Hirashima says that it has also become nearly impossible to catch anchovies and cherry bass in February due to higher ocean temperatures.,Adaptation to the climate crisis is possible and already underway. Farmers around Japan have even changed crops to get by. In the Nanyo region of Ehime Prefecture,,, which can tolerate higher levels of summer heat. On the islands and coastal areas of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, farmers have, to cope with warmer climates. A sake brewery that operated in Nakatsugawa, Gifu, for nearly 150 years recently,“The colder the weather is, the better the quality of sake,” Koji Yamada, president and master brewer of the company tells the Asahi Shimbun. “This is an issue we must resolve over the next 100 years.”,
,
,Hokkaido fishing operators, already suffering from poor salmon hauls and encountering inedible sunfish for the first time ever, are rapidly changing to yellowtail and even bluefin tuna in order to stay afloat.,“Yellowtail is an important fishery item mainly in southern Japan,” says Naoki Kumagai, a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies. “When it started to be caught in Hokkaido, it was (worthless). Now however, yellowtail has been priced well also in Hokkaido.”,But the cultural loss cannot be quantified. The indigenous Ainu people had 133 words for salmon, the crucial ingredient in Hokkaido’s beloved sashimi rice bowl. Fishing operators can catch yellowtail instead, but what is Hokkaido without salmon?,To protect their apple trees, farmers in Nagano Prefecture delay harvests and place reflective materials on the ground. But even these measures can’t prevent severe typhoons from,, much like Hagibis did two years ago. Nagano Prefecture is highly prized for its apples, and currently contributes to 18% of the national harvest. What is Nagano Prefecture without apples?,Thus, the climate crisis has begun to threaten long-standing regional specialties and local culture. The prices and accessibility of fish, fruit, grain and vegetables may create consequential changes in the economic and cultural life and image of regions around Japan.,
,
,Climate change, with its challenges, brings opportunities for innovation. The Environment Ministry reported on the growth of agriculture support services and technologies to improve the heat tolerance of buildings.,“The past few years have seen Japan’s national resilience — green infrastructure, smart city and other initiatives — turned into platforms that specifically link national agencies, subnational governments, business and civil society,” says Andrew DeWit, a professor of economics at Rikkyo University. “These partnerships have seen growth rates of several hundred percent over the past year.”,The larger problem is that Japan’s climate policy, despite Suga’s ambitious declaration, remains in limbo. After the 1992 Kyoto Protocol, Japan’s climate strategy was based on nuclear energy. However, following the nuclear meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant in 2011, Japan deactivated all of its nuclear reactors — and,. This shift led to a decade of resurgent fossil fuel use in the 2010s. Combined with stagnation in renewable growth, Japan is far from reducing emissions targets that align with the Paris agreement’s objectives.,“Since the Environment Ministry is in charge of climate change policy, measures are limited to homes and offices, and there is no energy or transportation policy,” says Kenrou Taura, a representative from Kiko Network, a Kyoto-based climate organization. “Many of the policies have further convinced people that measures against climate change are inconvenient and inhibit economic growth.”,
,
,Now, climate change itself is inhibiting economic growth, affecting infrastructure, rice, fruit, fisheries — and livelihoods — across Japan.,“We do not disregard individual efforts to be eco-friendly, but we believe there is a need for major social and economic changes,” Taura says. “We need adaptation and mitigation measures for each region, and information and educational programs to promote the participation and understanding of residents. Raising CO2 reduction targets should be given top priority.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Rena Matsui always knew she wanted to enter the acting world, and launching her career by performing in idol-pop groups was all part of her plan.,She started out as a member of the Nagoya-based SKE48 in 2008 before joining Nogizaka46 in Tokyo, becoming one of the top stars of Japan’s many all-female singing and dancing troupes. In 2015, she left both groups to dedicate herself to acting.,
,“I was determined to be an actor, so I decided to be an idol in order to get that chance,” she says in a recent video call.,Growing up in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, Matsui developed an early interest in stage performances through her mother’s love of the Takarazuka Revue, a long-running all-female musical theater company.,“Then, when I watched a DVD of (playwright and director) Koki Mitani’s musical ‘Okepi!,’ which shows the goings-on and gossip between musicians in an orchestra pit, I was amazed by how great it was to explore the entertainment world by focusing on people who aren’t always in the spotlight,” she says.,“I realized that theater has room for unconventional ideas, and I wanted to be an actor who uses their own rich imagination to express intangible things on stage.”,Now Matsui, 30, is taking her acting career to new heights by tackling her first Shakespeare play, an all-female version of the Roman tragedy “Julius Caesar.”,
,
,In this production — running through Oct. 31 at the Parco Theater in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, ahead of a nationwide tour till Nov. 28 — Matsui plays the pivotal role of Mark Antony, a general and follower of Julius Caesar (Sylvia Grab), the charismatic leader of the Roman republic.,Rather than staging the play’s battle scenes, however, director Shintaro Mori has condensed the original text to focus on the tense verbal disputes that arose among Rome’s ruling classes before and after the assassination of Caesar on March 15, 44 B.C.,The play opens days before the deadly deed, with two of Caesar’s erstwhile supporters, senators Cassius (Kio Matsumoto) and Marcus Brutus (Yo Yoshida), agonizing over their leader’s abuses of power. To preserve the republic, the pair hatch a plot to kill Caesar, which soon gains wide support.,After completing their mission — with numerous assailants stabbing Caesar 23 times — Cassius and Brutus stay in Rome to defend their actions. However, when Antony addresses the public, calling for compromise and the conspirators to be spared punishment, his speech subtly turns the crowd against Cassius and Brutus. While his eloquent oration — which famously begins with the lines, “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him” — heads off an uprising against Rome’s aristocrats, it also effectively nixes the rebels’ calls for reform.,“This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays because I saw a great version by the Kaki Kuu Kyaku theater company in 2013. That, too, was performed by a cast of women and they exposed the Roman power games in a high-tension, high-speed production… (their version) was enjoyable and easily intelligible, too,” Matsui says.,“Another reason I love this play is that it follows several ambitious characters, whereas many classic plays focus on one protagonist. I think it’s exciting as the story changes quickly in a way that is very contemporary.”,Meanwhile, she says the all-female cast didn’t feel strange about playing the roles of male aristocrats.,“We don’t speak in low voices to pretend to be men, and we don’t wear trousers, but simple dresses. So we look (and sound) like women — but speak as male characters — and it seems very natural to me. It’s my first experience with this kind of casting, and I actually feel as though I’m acting like a human being, not particularly like a man,” Matsui explains.,She adds that she enjoys hearing how the characters change their voices depending on who they’re speaking to, revealing the power dynamics between the four leads. She was especially amused by how Cassius implemented different voices for various purposes when talking to Brutus. “I almost laughed when I first heard that,” Matsui says.,While the actress says this production is a “genderless drama,” she recognizes the ways in which the all-female cast affects the staging. She points out, for example, that the mood of the masses — played by a female chorus — “changes in harmony” as a result of “womanly conformity” rather than “manly dominance.”,As for her own role, Matsui says it was difficult to play Antony, who cleverly sways the crowd to ostracize Brutus and Cassius, in a bid to take over Rome himself.,Matsui observes that many characters in the play say what they believe and act accordingly. When Brutus kills Caesar, for instance, it’s because he wants to protect Rome and he fears that Caesar is becoming a tyrant — even though he truly loves and respects him. Afterward, he does not flee the scene. “So Brutus had an unshakable belief that he lived by,” Matsui says.,Antony’s true intentions, however, are not as clear. Matsui says she wonders whether Antony was really distressed about Caesar’s death, or if his display of sadness was actually a performance for the Roman citizens.,“It’s very difficult to understand Antony’s mental state, and my initial interpretations kept changing.,“Then the director advised me not to overanalyze it, and just to say the lines again and again. He said that if I repeated the lines every day, I would be able to ride the waves of the role, like mastering surfing. Now I’ve reached that moment and I’m having fun being Antony.”,Keeping Mori’s advice in mind, Matsui says she connects with the Roman general’s feelings through her movements on stage as well.,“If I had made a concrete acting plan for Antony’s speech in advance, the scene would have become superficial and rigid. So when I stand at the rostrum, in my mind I’m just speaking to each member of the public listening to me. That way, I sense the energy of the masses gradually building until they finally connect to Antony’s words, enabling them to stand firm against the conspirators.,“However, it’s technically very difficult because I can’t make eye contact with every individual. So working out how to persuasively communicate with each listener on stage and each audience member — that’s the key thing.”,With her Shakespeare baptism under her belt, Matsui says she wants to visit the Bard’s homeland as soon as it’s safe to travel abroad.,“I had planned to visit a friend who is studying (in England), but COVID-19 stopped me from going,” she says. “Then the other day she sent me a photo of a statue of Caesar in Bath, so I want to go there and see it for myself.”,“Julius Caesar” runs Oct. 10 through 31 at the Parco Theater in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo. It will then go on tour to Osaka, Yamagata, Fukushima, Miyagi Prefecture, Toyama and Aichi Prefecture till Nov. 28.  For more information, visit ,.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,For his first foray into the realm of opera, dramatist Toshiki Okada is tackling Ikuma Dan’s one-act “Yuzuru” (“Twilight Crane”), a Japanese classic that has been performed here almost 1,000 times since its premiere in 1952.,It is certainly not the first time that the 48-year-old Okada, who is the founder of Tokyo’s globe-trotting Chelfitsch theater company and winner of many of Japan’s top drama awards, has sought to expand his creative horizons. From 2016 to 2019, he held the position of director of repertoires at the Munich Kammerspiele in Germany, and in June he presented his self-penned contemporary noh play, “Unfulfilled Ghost and the Monster: Zaha/Tsuruga,” which questions both Japan’s nuclear power policy and the discord among Olympic organizers that resulted in one scandal after another in the lead-up to this year’s Games.,
,The opera “Yuzuru” is based on a 1949 play of the same name by leading postwar playwright Junji Kinoshita, which draws upon a folk story about a poor farmer named Yohyo (Takumi Yogi) who saves an injured crane that later transforms into a beautiful woman named Tsu (Sara Kobayashi) and marries him.,As a sign of her gratitude, Tsu uses her feathers to weave beautiful fabric for Yohyo to sell, but she asks her husband to promise he will never watch her at work. Yohyo agrees, but goaded by his money-grubbing friends Sodo (Hirohisa Sannohe) and Unzu (Koji Terada), he urges her to weave more and more, leaving Tsu wondering why he isn’t content with a simple life together.,One night, Yohyo peeks into her room and sees an ailing Tsu in her crane form, busily weaving. When his wife discovers that he has broken his promise, she flies away into the night sky and leaves him forever. It is then that Yohyo realizes he has lost a love that no amount of money will ever make up for.,At a press conference ahead of the opera’s opening, Okada seemed undaunted by staging such a well-known piece, saying, “I’ve never had much to do with opera before. But as I got this great opportunity, I wanted to find out what exactly a director does in opera.”,Bringing his wealth of experience in dramatic theater to “Yuzuru,” Okada said he “discovered the point of my role” after roughly a week of workshops and rehearsals with the conductors and singers.,“Before this project, I understood music as a rather abstract art form far removed from stories and meanings, but I now newly realize that opera music expresses the story and the characters’ feelings in every way,” he said. “Therefore, opera directors don’t need to be involved in such things as creating the characters during the rehearsals. So, I am going about this in a different way from my usual theater approach.”,And yet, soprano Kobayashi said that she was surprised that Okada spent such a long time discussing the opera’s content with the cast — adding that is “very rare in conventional opera rehearsals,” which mostly focus on the actors’ singing.,Tenor Yogi agreed, saying, “We are having discussions about everything together. Okada decides each movement based on our communal understanding after listening to everyone’s opinions. Even if a scene doesn’t relate to me, he asks for my opinion, and inevitably that makes me become more interested in the other characters.,“I was never like that before. It’s entirely new for me and I am so excited about this new method.”,Okada’s democratic way of working is not the only aspect that makes this production of “Yuzuru” different from past stagings. Instead of presenting a love story centered on a tragic female character, the director said his contemporary version will focus on “the damaging influence of capitalism,” critiquing how irreplaceable assets are mindlessly wasted for short-term gain in the modern world.,“Of course, I won’t change the music or lyrics. That’s out of the question,” he said, adding that what he envisions is “a vivid production that viscerally connects with today’s audiences whose lives have been captured by capitalism.”,To further modernize his opera and make it relatable to each audience member, Okada said, “I have changed Tsu’s character from being folklore’s image of a pure and innocent victim to that of an individual rejecting the temptations of capitalism and asking whether our values based on it are really right or not.”,As Kobayashi put it, “I first saw the play ‘Yuzuru’ when I was a junior high school student and Tsu became one of my dream roles. Since then I’ve seen many versions by different directors, but now I’m thinking I need to reset my image of this heroine and start to create an entirely new Tsu from scratch.,“So the challenge is how to present Okada’s new concept of ‘Yuzuru’ to the audiences. That’s what I’m wrestling with.”,“Yuzuru” will be performed on Oct. 30 at Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre in Toshima Ward, Tokyo. It will then play at Kariya City Hall in Aichi Prefecture on Jan. 30 and Kumamoto Prefectural Theater in Kumamoto Prefecture on Feb. 5.

			,Reuters,Rugby Championship organizer SANZAAR has confirmed world champions South Africa will continue to play in the annual competition until 2025.,The move ends speculation the South Africans were planning to leave the Southern Hemisphere championship, which also features New Zealand, Australia and Argentina, to join the Six Nations setup in Europe.,
,“The pandemic has created a very unusual sporting environment over the last two years with match and commercial delivery severely affected,” said SANZAAR chairman Marcelo Rodriguez.,“This has seen the member unions work very hard to keep rugby alive and present during COVID and at times this has not been easy.,“Indeed there has been much speculation about the future but it is now great that all members have committed through until the end of 2025 as a minimum.,“This means we can concentrate on ensuring The Rugby Championship remains as one of the best rugby tournaments on the world calendar.”,The impact of the pandemic meant the majority of the 2021 Rugby Championship was played in Australia, but SANZAAR remains confident the four nations will be able to host matches in the upcoming edition.,“Despite the lingering effects of the pandemic, it is planned that The Rugby Championship 2022 will be played in its entirety with a return to matches being played in all four countries,” the organization said in a statement.,“Due to the pandemic the match schedule over the last two years has been severely affected with no matches played in Argentina and only a handful of matches taking place in South Africa and New Zealand.,“The full 2022 match schedule will be announced in due course.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Unbeaten France heads to Murrayfield with an underdog mentality and a point to prove against Scotland on Saturday as it continues its bid for a Six Nations Grand Slam.,Fabien Galthie’s team is two-fifths of the way towards a first title and Grand Slam since 2010, after home wins against Italy (37-10) and Ireland (30-24).,
,Nevertheless, France is wary of a Scotland side that has beaten it in their last two Six Nations encounters and will be seeking its first hat trick of victories against France in the Six Nations in 64 years.,“We’re going there with an underdog mentality and with a point to prove,” said France’s English-born defense coach Shaun Edwards, who has played a key role in molding Les Bleus into a potentially world-beating force 18 months before a home World Cup.,“Scotland are the only side we haven’t beaten in the Six Nations since Fabien and I took over. They’ve got the better of us on the last two occasions,” he added.,Overcoming an outstanding Ireland side in Paris two weeks ago showed France has maintained the momentum of its stunning 40-25 success against New Zealand at the Stade de France in November.,France arrives in Edinburgh as the only unbeaten team left in the 2022 Six Nations and on a run of five straight victories in all competitions.,Scotland followed its stirring 20-17 home win against England with an abject performance in a 20-17 defeat by Wales in Cardiff.,Gregor Townsend’s side, however, dashed France’s Grand Slam hopes at Murrayfield in 2020, winning 28-17 after French prop Mohamed Haouas was sent off for punching Jamie Ritchie, and ended Les Bleus’ 2021 title challenge with a dramatic 27-23 win in Paris.,France did win an Autumn Nations Cup fixture 22-15 against a weakened Scotland team at an empty Murrayfield in November 2020 and has yet to lose three successive Championship matches in a row to the Scots in the Six Nations era.,The last time it happened dates back to the era of the Five Nations, in 1958.,“Scotland are a team that pose problems for us and we are aware of the level we will need to be at this time,” said Galthie, who has kept changes to a minimum.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Saitama Panasonic Wild Knights won a rematch of last season’s Top League championship, again ending Tokyo Suntory Sungoliath’s unbeaten season, this time in a 34-17 Japan Rugby League One victory on Saturday.,Wild Knights wing Marika Koroibete was named man of the match for his punishing runs that unhinged Sungoliath’s defense from start to finish, while Ben Gunter, who scored the hosts’ first try at Kumagaya Rugby Stadium, could have earned that honor as well.,
,Japan international Rikiya Matsuda opened the scoring in the third minute with the first of his five penalties on a day when he scored 19 with his boot.,“We knew this would be a tough game from the start,” Matsuda said. “We were able to move well from defense to attack. My teammates forced a lot of penalties, and I’m glad I could fulfill my responsibilities.”,Sungoliath fullback, All Black Damian McKenzie, kept the hosts on the back foot from the start with his boot and pace. He converted two early tries and added a penalty as Suntory seized a 17-3 lead less than 20 minutes into the game.,Indiscipline, however, short-circuited Sungoliath’s dangerous offense and neutralized the work of McKenzie and Wallaby Samu Kerevi, who was a constant threat.,Gunter scored Wild Knights’ first try, on a long throw from a lineout. Hooker Atsushi Sakate crossed in a maul after another lineout just before the half, which ended with some fireworks from both teams but no points with Panasonic leading 20-17.,Three Matsuda penalties made it 29-17 before Koroibete put a cork in this one with a thundering run before passing to Dylan Riley for a 72nd-minute try.,Wild Knights improved to 5-2, including two forfeits when coronavirus countermeasures prevented them from fielding a team in the new league’s first two weeks.,“Panasonic brought an excellent game,” Suntory captain Ryoto Nakamura said. “We were able to attack the way we want, but were unable to string together our good efforts over 80 minutes.”,Kubota Spears Funabashi Tokyo Bay, who have benefited from two coronavirus forfeits, moved into first place with 41-20 win over Toyota Verblitz. Sungoliath are two points back in second, with Verblitz third on 23 points and Wild Knights fourth on 22.,Elsewhere, Shizuoka Blue Revs beat NEC Green Rockets Tokatsu 34-27, while Kai Ishii’s late try lifted NTT Communications Shining Arcs Tokyo Bay Urayasu to a 22-11 win over Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo despite being down a man.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,France captain Antoine Dupont urged his side to guard against complacency after they moved within two matches of a first Six Nations title and Grand Slam since 2010 by sweeping aside bogey team Scotland with a thumping 36-17 victory at Murrayfield on Saturday.,“We’re very satisfied with this victory because it’s very difficult to win at Murrayfield, but we still have two matches to play and we have to remain cautious,” said Dupont, whose side ran in six tries to overwhelm a Scotland team who thwarted their title ambitions in 2020 and 2021.,
,Having already overcome Italy and Ireland at home, France will head to Wales on March 11, with the chance of clinching a title and Grand Slam against England in Paris eight days later.,“We haven’t won the tournament for twelve years and we have to aim for that,” added Dupont, who set up the opening try for giant lock Paul Willemse with a blistering break.,“But we have to make sure we are not complacent. We have to be rigorous.”,The French were rigorous and ruthless in their attacking from turnover ball as tries from Willemse, wingers Yoram Moefana and Damian Penaud, who bagged two, and centers Gael Fickou and Jonathan Danty earned their first Six Nations win in Edinburgh since 2014.,“The French are probably up there with the All Blacks in terms of getting tries from turnover ball,” said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend, whose players beat England in their opening game but now find themselves out of the title reckoning, having lost to Wales in Cardiff two weeks ago.,“Their front five add to that as well. It’s not just the backs. You’ve got a real XV who can attack.”,France are now on a six-match winning streak which includes their stunning 40-25 victory against New Zealand in Paris in November.,“In international rugby, what is important is to win matches,” said France head coach Fabien Galthie.,“We have to win and each victory is one more brick that we put on the wall that we’re trying to build.,“However, losses allow us to learn a lot and what we experienced here two years ago helped us a lot today.”,Asked about his team’s ruthless counterattacking, the former France captain and scrum-half said: “Rugby is a transition game. That is what we have worked on consistently — and also how to use our qualities, the intuition we have to allow the players to shift quickly from defense to attack.,“You can see in our training sessions we work on this transition game. You could see that today. There was quality in our decision making and great carrying of the ball.”,Scotland, hit by the loss of flanker Hamish Watson to COVID-19 on the eve of the match, will head to Rome to face Italy on March 12 before finishing their campaign against Ireland in Dublin.,“It’s a horrible feeling in the changing room,” said captain Stuart Hogg, whose side closed to within two points after a 28th minute try by flanker Rory Darge but tailed off long before winger Duhan van der Merwe’s 80th minute score.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,“On behalf of the JRFU and the entire Japanese rugby family, I would like to express our sincere delight that the French national team will tour Japan this summer,” said JRFU President Shigetaka Mori.,“Les Bleus are playing remarkably well in the Six Nations Championship and continue to develop a potent style of play, combining power and speed with their traditional flair.,“With France due to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023, they are emerging as strong contenders for their home tournament.”,Japan reached the quarterfinals of the 2019 World Cup on home soil but did not play in 2020 because of the COVID-19 outbreak, returning to action after 18 months against the British & Irish Lions in June 2021.,The Brave Blossoms won only one of their six matches last year, against Portugal.,“As a result of the global pandemic, Japanese rugby fans have missed out on regular test match rugby being played in Japan,” Mori said.,“This series is therefore an important opportunity for us to reconnect with our fans, and I am certain the rugby family in Japan will be looking forward to reliving the enthusiasm and excitement that they experienced during Rugby World Cup 2019.”,France were held to a 23-23 draw at home by Japan the last time the teams met in November 2017.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Ireland captain Johnny Sexton said he hopes to go out on “a high, not a whimper” after he signed a contract extension through to the 2023 Rugby World Cup on Tuesday.,Sexton will be 38 by the time rugby’s quadrennial showpiece tournament kicks off in France and there had been speculation over whether he would carry on till then.,
,“I wanted to keep the dream going,” Sexton said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I do not want to go out on a whimper and hopefully I finish on a high at the World Cup.,“I am delighted to be able to say it has come to fruition (the contract) as I have been beating round the bush for six months.,“I want to make the most of my last 18 months of my career and to do that is to work hard and get my body in the best shape possible.”,Sexton is rightly regarded as a talisman both by his country and province Leinster and was crowned world player of the year in 2018.,He made his international debut against Fiji in November 2009 and has represented Ireland at three Rugby World Cups, in 2011, 2015 and 2019.,The latter tournament has proved a bugbear for both Ireland and Sexton as they have yet to reach the semifinals.,After being hammered by New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup, Sexton remarked that the manner of the defeat would be “raw for four years.”,“One of the biggest factors for me was talking to fellows who had retired after a World Cup and the disappointment they felt at not performing,” he said on Tuesday, of his decision to carry on till 2023.,“Age-wise a lot of players performed at the top of their game well into their thirties — take Richie McCaw and Brad Thorn, they won the World Cup trophy aged 34 and 36.”,Sexton is a two-time British and Irish Lions tourist, in 2013 and 2017, and has won three Six Nations titles with Ireland — including the 2018 Grand Slam — and five European Cups with Leinster.,IRFU Performance Director David Nucifora said Sexton had proved in his performances since the 2019 World Cup that he was still one of the world’s top players.,“Johnny’s performances continue to be of the highest standard and he remains an integral member of the Ireland and Leinster squads,” said Nucifora.,“He has always been a leader on the field and in the past two years since taking on the Ireland captaincy his leadership off it has been top class.”,Sexton’s first match in the final 18-month chapter of his career will be the daunting Six Nations clash with England at Twickenham on Saturday.,Both sides have lost a match apiece but are still in with a chance of winning the title, though France holds the whip hand with three wins from three matches.,England head coach Eddie Jones has labeled the Irish as favorites for the game.,“It is irrelevant,” said Sexton. “We have not won many times over there in the recent past.,“This game will be decided by who can put their best performance out there.,“We will prepare down to the finest detail such as the atmosphere that is going to hit us and their intensity.,“It will be a great test to see if we learned lessons from the French game (Ireland lost 30-24 in Paris) and if we can adapt in an away stadium.”,Sexton also cast an eye further ahead after the World Cup.,“I will be able to have a beer or a glass of wine a bit more often,” he said with a smile. “It has been an absolute dream to do what I have done and for so long as I have I pinch myself.,“When I hang up my boots I will be like a lost puppy but hopefully not for too long.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Nathan Chen won the U.S. Figure Skating Championships for the sixth consecutive year in dominating fashion on Sunday to solidify his status as the favorite to win gold at next month’s Beijing Olympics.,Chen, whose sole defeat since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games came last October in the first Grand Prix event of the Olympic figure skating season, was far from perfect in his free skate as he fell twice, but still did more than enough to separate himself from the pack.,
,The 22-year-old Chen was in first place after breaking his own national short program record on Saturday with a 115.39-point performance and returned to score 212.62 points in Sunday’s free skate.,Chen’s 328.01 total left him in a familiar spot atop the podium. Ilia Malinin (302.48) took second and Vincent Zhou (290.16) finished third.,“The competition was really tough today,” Chen said. “I’m glad to be a part of this generation and just looking forward to seeing where we can continue pushing U.S. figure skating.”,Chen fell early during his free skate and toward the end of the program laughed off a misstep that saw him faceplant on the ice during a choreographic sequence.,When it was all done Chen had completed six quadruple jumps between the two programs to extend his reign.,No American man has enjoyed such a dominant run at the national championships since two-time Olympic champion Dick Button won seven consecutive titles from 1946 to 1952.,Malinin, a 17-year-old competing in his first national championships, landed four quads during a clean free skate but it was not enough to secure a ticket to Beijing as he was passed over for a spot on the team by a selection committee.,The committee, which considers results dating back to the January 2021 U.S. Championships, instead chose Chen, Zhou and fourth-place finisher Jason Brown.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Russia’s Kamila Valieva, just 15 years old, hammered home her status as Olympic gold-medal favorite on Saturday when she swept to the European title in Tallinn.,Valieva — in her first season on the senior circuit — led a Russian sweep of the women’s podium, with her 259.06 points enough to defeat world champion Anna Shcherbakova (237.42 points) and Alexandra Trusova (234.36).,
,Russia also claimed titles in the men’s event, pairs and ice dance in a stunning performance less than three weeks before the Winter Olympics start in Beijing on Feb. 4.,“I am so happy, there are so many emotions that I can’t put them into words,” said Valieva who skated to “Bolero.”,“The medal means that I don’t just come to the practices for nothing and I guess the most important for me is not to burn out after this season, to calm down as much as possible and try to make the audience happy with my performances.,“I don’t know what will happen tomorrow, I live with today but am so happy with today being at the European Championships, it’s a childhood dream.”,In Thursday’s short program, Valieva had set a new world record of 90.45 points after a flawless performance to “In Memoriam.”,It bettered her previous world best mark of 87.42 points at the Russian Grand Prix in November.,Earlier on Saturday, Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov retained their ice dance title.,Sinitsina and Katsalapov won with a total of 217.96 points, ahead of compatriots Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin, who scored 213.20, and Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri on 207.97.,Their main rivals for Olympic gold, French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, the 2018 Olympic runners-up, opted to miss the event in Tallinn as a health precaution ahead of the Beijing Games.,“These European Championships will be in our hearts for a very long time,” said Sinitsina after dancing to Rakhmaninov’s “Piano Concerto No. 2.”,The winners obtained their best total of this Olympic winter.,But, with two scores above the 220 points in the Turin and Grenoble Grand Prix events in November, the French pair still hold an edge in their long-distance duel.,Sinitsina and Katsalapov won their first European title in 2020, narrowly edging the French pair, who had won the previous five titles.,The Russians also took the world title last March after the Montreal-based French duo opted to skip the event in Stockholm following a COVID-19-hit season.,It was a memorable tournament for Russia in the Estonian capital.,Teenager Mark Kondratiuk marked his European figure skating championship debut with the men’s title.,In the pairs, Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov claimed the European crown to add to their world championship triumph last year.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,,"Japan 2030:,The Japan Times","Self-Defense Forces personnel search for flood victims in Motomiya, Fukushima Prefecture, in October in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis. KYODO,As the country’s bushland has burned over the past few months, more than an estimated 10 million hectares have already been reduced to ash. At least 28 people and more than a billion animals are believed to have been killed by the fires as of mid-January.,Support has been pouring in from the international community, including Japan, which dispatched two Air Self-Defense Force planes and personnel to Australia earlier this month.,“Climate-related natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly, more destructive, with growing human and financial costs,” Guterres said. “Drought in some parts of the world is progressing at alarming rates, destroying human habitats and endangering food security. … In short, climate change is no longer a long-term problem. We are confronted now with a global climate crisis.”,Average global temperatures are already 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels and, unless the world takes concrete action, average temperatures are on track to rise by an estimated 3 or 4 degrees by the end of the century.,In October 2018, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report that called on the world to keep average global temperatures at no more than 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels, instead of the established 2-degree goal.,Rajib Shaw, a professor at Keio University and one of the lead authors of the report, says the 0.5-degree difference is crucial to many climate-related issues.,Failing to meet the 1.5-degree target, he says, will mean that the number of people exposed to heat waves will more than double from 14 percent to 37 percent of the global population, marine fish stocks will decline by 1.5 million tons and the loss of wildlife species, including vertebrates and plants, will double.,“I believe that the next 10 years will witness extreme levels of climate change and disaster risks,” Shaw says. “Extreme, however, means it usually does not happen and so these risks will no longer be ‘extreme.’ Extreme events will be the new normal.”,The IPCC report also stipulates that the world has until 2030 to cut global emissions of carbon dioxide by about 45 percent from 2010 levels and reach net zero by around 2050 to stop global warming at 1.5 degrees. In December, however, it was revealed that global emissions are still on the rise; 2019’s carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase by 0.6 percent compared to 2018, reaching a record high of 36.8 billion tons.,Sixty-five countries have so far committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Major emitters such as Japan, however, have not.,“Even if countries pledge not to emit carbon dioxide anymore, we cannot change the current situation immediately. It took decades to get to where we are now, so it will take time to change the climate again,” Shaw says. “That’s why mitigation is important, but equally important is adaptation because we have to live with this current state.”,During the U.N. conference in December, Japan joined a list of countries that received the satirical “Fossil of the Day” award by an international environmental organization after failing to commit to stop the nation’s reliance on coal-fired power generation.,Guterres has called on countries to stop building new coal-fired plants from 2020, criticizing the Asia region’s “addiction to coal.”,Japan is the only Group of Seven nation that is still in the process of constructing new plants, although Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi at least admits that he is aware of the issue.,While Japan has stopped short of promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a few local governments have begun to make decarbonization declarations. As of Jan. 20, 51 municipalities — including Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka and Iwate prefectures, as well as cities such as Kyoto, Kagoshima and Ikoma in Nara, have pledged net zero carbon emissions within the next 30 years.,“Zero carbon cities are increasing rapidly throughout Japan,” Koizumi said during the December news conference. “The awakening of local governments should continue, ultimately leading Japan to introduce more renewable energy and become a driving force for the country to realize a decarbonized society.”,A storm surge caused by Typhoon Hagibis pounds the coast of Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture, in October 2019. KYODO,Japan is the world’s fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the U.S., India and Russia. The government has pledged to cut emissions by 26 percent from 2013 levels to 1.042 billion tons by 2030.,So far, Japan has succeeded in reducing emissions for five consecutive years to 1.244 billion tons in fiscal 2018, marking the lowest level since fiscal 1990, when the government began collecting data.,The Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 at a U.N. conference on climate change and has been ratified by 187 countries and territories, including Japan. The accord establishes an international framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 2020, replacing its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol.,Satoru Morishita, vice minister for global environmental affairs at the Environment Ministry, promises to meet this ambitious goal. “Japan has declared that it will achieve decarbonization after 2050, which means it will cut carbon dioxide emitted — not only from thermal coal, but also from natural gas — to carbon neutral,” Morishita says. “When Japan says it will do something, it will.”,A key area in which the government is focused on is innovation of technology such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, as well as the development of hydrogen energy, which does not produce carbon dioxide.,Meanwhile, Japanese corporations, especially those in the financial industry, are also playing a major role in tackling climate change, Morishita says.,In December, the Japan Business Federation unveiled a new initiative called “challenge zero” to promote and support companies taking innovative steps to create a decarbonized society in line with the government’s policy. Participating organizations would either pledge to innovate, install or diffuse net zero carbon technology, or invest in such companies.,“The financial industry is well aware of the looming climate-change crisis,” Morishita says. “If global warming continues and becomes 4 degrees higher than preindustrial levels, too many natural disasters would occur and insurance for damages (from such events) would cease to exist. The sector is very worried about such a scenario.”,Environmental experts such as Itaru Yasui, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, generally agree the world needs to take immediate measures to cut carbon emissions but they also acknowledge the difficulty of achieving this in the wake of the triple core meltdown in Fukushima after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.,Since the disaster, public sentiment has turned against nuclear power, making it hard for politicians to promote it as an energy source in spite of its zero carbon emissions. Many of the country’s nuclear power plants remain idle and, instead, lawmakers have turned to coal. Since 2012, Japan has reportedly unveiled plans to build 50 new coal-fired power stations nationwide.,Before the disaster, nuclear energy accounted for about 30 percent of Japan’s overall power supply, and the government had planned to increase this percentage to about half by 2030.,Instead, nuclear energy accounted for just 2 percent of the country’s total supply in 2016, while coal increased from 27 percent in 2010 to 33 percent in 2016, according to data compiled by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy in 2018.,“It’s important to find a good balance between economic development and environmental protection, but this is actually extremely difficult,” Yasui says. “Japan is stuck between a rock and a hard place because it cannot rely on nuclear energy anymore.”,Like numerous other countries around the world, Japan has also observed its fair share of extreme weather in recent years.,In 2018, Japan endured a record heat wave that at one point pushed temperatures up to 41.1 degrees Celsius. According to the health ministry, 1,581 people died as a result of heat-related complications that year, more than double the number of heat-related deaths the previous year.,Torrential rain also struck western Japan the same summer, resulting in 237 deaths as a consequence of floods and landslides.,Two devastating typhoons — Faxai and Hagibis — also tore through Japan last fall. Typhoon Faxai struck the Kanto region in September, cutting power to 934,900 homes. A month later, Typhoon Hagibis tore through the same region, damaging more than 90,000 homes and killing 99 people. Three people are still missing as of Jan. 10.,“There is something wrong with the state of the world today and typhoons will only get worse,” Yasui says.,From the state of the weather to agriculture and fisheries, climate change is affecting people’s lives. According to the Environment Ministry, rising temperatures and increasing rainfall have resulted in immature rice grains as well as mandarin oranges whose skin and fruit separated, negatively affecting their quality. Tiger mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever were once found in the Kanto region but they have since been detected much farther north as temperatures have risen across the country. And as we’ve known for many years, the ocean’s coral is dying off due to rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification.,In June 2018, Japan passed the Climate Change Adaptation Law, which stipulates that a plan must be drafted to promote measures to adapt to the negative impact of global warming.,“We need to look to the future — 10, 20 years ahead — and continue to adapt to changes as well,” Morishita says. “The same goes for disaster prevention. Instead of looking back at the past, we need to predict what will happen in the next 50 years and establish both hard and soft infrastructure. It would be as significant as the Copernican Revolution.”,From plastic waste and gender inequality to poverty and global conflict, climate change is just one of a number of pressing issues the world currently faces. To overcome these challenges, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September 2015.,According to this initiative, both developing and developed nations have until 2030 — another 10 years — to achieve the 17 goals, which include such things as good health, quality education, protection of biodiversity in the ocean and on land, gender equality and climate action. The initiative replaces its predecessor, the millennium development goals that ended in 2015 and focused more on issues developing nations faced such as poverty and child mortality.,“The SDGs are not just about social and economic problems. There is the added risk of climate change,” Shaw says. “Be it direct or not, climate change affects all of the 17 SDGs.”,Many young people, led by environmental Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, have also begun to take a stand against the climate crisis across the globe.,has gained attention in Japan as well but the number of participants is still low compared to other nations.,Yasui, who is also president of the Institute for Promoting Sustainable Societies, urges more Japanese youth to demand action against climate change. Otherwise, he says, the world is almost certainly going to be in worse shape when Thunberg’s generation turns 50.,“Humans are a truly dangerous species. We are alive because of the Earth and, if something happens to it, we won’t be able to survive,” Yasui says. “The Earth doesn’t exist for our convenience. If we act selfishly, it will break down.”,COURTESY OF ITARU YASUI"

			,AFP-Jiji,Japan’s Mai Mihara put her bitterness at missing out on a spot in the Winter Olympics behind her by winning gold for the second time in the ISU Four Continents Figure Skating Championships on Saturday, as the United States enjoyed a one-two in the pairs event.,Mihara’s fourth-placed finish at the Japanese national championships in December ended her hopes of competing at her first Winter Games in Beijing, but she held her nerve in Tallinn to reclaim a title she won five years ago.,
,In the pairs, Audrey Lu and Misha Mitrofanov survived a fall in the free skate to win gold by an 8.16-point margin over fellow Americans Emily Chan and Spencer Akira Howe in the Estonian capital.,Mihara, 22, led all the way, scoring a career-high 218.03 points and bettering South Korean skaters Lee Hae-in (213.52) and Kim Ye-lim (209.91), who claimed their first ISU medals with silver and bronze respectively.,“I was so nervous today as the nationals were in the back of my mind, like a flashback,” said Mihara.,“I was crying even before I went on the ice, but I was able to overcome that bitterness from nationals and bring home a gold medal to Japan.”,Mihara extended her lead from the short program, despite a glitch on her final spin in her free skate to “Fairy of the Forest” and “Galaxy” by Yuko Toyoda, scoring a career-best 145.41.,It was her fourth medal in the competition following her gold in 2017, with silver and bronze in 2018 and 2019 respectively.,“The order was 1, 2, 3 so I didn’t want to end up with fourth placement this time,” she said.,“This gold has a totally different meaning than 2017.,“This time I put pressure on myself. I needed to go on the top of the podium and get the gold. I was overwhelmed with joy on seeing the results, with tears rolling.”,Lee and Kim bettered South Korean national champion You Young who finished sixth after an error-strewn free skate including a fall on her triple toeloop.,Sixteen-year-old Lee skated to “Homage to Korea” by Ji Pyeong Kwon for her first participation in the competition, landing seven clean triple jumps, for a career best 143.55, and improving her previous personal best by 10 points.,Kim, 19, held third place despite finishing fourth in the free dance to Puccini’s Turandot, as she prepares for the Olympics after finishing second at nationals.,“This competition has given me confidence,” she said.,“It was very close to nationals and I was worried about my condition. I had a clean program today so this gives me confidence.”,In pairs, despite Lu falling in their free skate to Ronan Hardiman’s “Ancient Lands”, the Americans held their lead from the short program, scoring 189.10 points overall, with Chan and Akira Howe scoring 180.94.,Canada’s Evelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud scored 179.70 points to take bronze.,The American and Canadian skaters are not competing in the Beijing Olympics.,Most of the top skaters from Asia and North America have opted to skip the competition, which takes place just two weeks before the Winter Games, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.,China did not send a team to Estonia.,The competition concludes on Sunday with South Korean champion Cha Jun-hwan leading Japanese duo Kazuki Tomono and Kao Miura in the men’s event going into the free skate.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,A rivalry that fizzled out in Pyeongchang four years ago may produce fireworks at the Beijing Games when two-time defending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu battles American Nathan Chen in his quest for more figure skating glory.,The Japanese “Ice Prince” will be trying to match Gillis Grafstrom’s 94-year record of three consecutive Olympic golds in the men’s singles event, four years after joining U.S. icon Dick Button as a back-to-back winner.,
,Widely regarded the finest skater of the modern era, Hanyu could stake his claim as the greatest of all time if he can withstand the threat of quad-jumping virtuoso Chen.,Many expected their rivalry to light up the 2018 Games, but Chen, then a teenager, stumbled through a calamitous short program in his Olympic debut.,Now 22, Chen has bounced back magnificently through the Olympic cycle, claiming three world titles in succession to again loom as Hanyu’s chief threat at Beijing’s Capital Indoor Stadium.,It would be risky to bet against Hanyu, however, given his experience and track record of performing on the biggest stage.,“When it is an Olympic Games, Yuzuru always shows up,” former U.S. champion Adam Rippon said.,“He always steps into the light of that moment.”,There will be no chance of a repeat winner in the women’s singles, however, with Pyeongchang champion Alina Zagitova overshadowed by the brilliant Russian teens who have since taken over the sport.,Though barely heard of outside of Russia a few months ago, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva is the latest quad-jumping sensation from the stable of master coach Eteri Tutberidze.,She lead a Russian sweep of the women’s singles podium spots at the European championships and could easily do the same in Beijing.,Russian skaters have strength across the board, making them a major contender for the team title, but home fans will be hopeful Sui Wenjing and Han Cong can deny them gold in the pairs event.,Sui and Han, who hold the world record for total points in competition and took silver in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were runners-up to Russians Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov at the 2021 world championships but felt they were only at 70-80% of their best after rushed preparations.,With iconic Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir retired after their second ice dance gold at Pyeongchang, Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron will hope their time has come in Beijing — and that their costumes stay intact.,Papadakis suffered a heartbreaking wardrobe malfunction in the short program four year ago, but the four-time world champions won hearts with their brave recovery to win silver.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji, staff report,Figure skating star Yuzuru Hanyu will miss this month’s world championships because an ankle sprain he suffered at the Beijing Olympics has not fully healed, the Japan Skating Federation said Tuesday.,The two-time Olympic gold medalist fell twice during his free skate at the 2022 Winter Games in the Chinese capital, where he finished fourth in the men’s individual competition.,
,He had been due to compete at the ISU World Figure Skating Championships in Montpellier, France, from March 21-27, but Kao Miura will be sent in his place, the JSF said in a statement.,The organization said Hanyu could not skate at the event because “the sprain of his right ankle joint, injured at the Beijing Olympics, hasn’t healed.”,Hanyu, 27, had been chasing a third consecutive gold at the Games in February and went for broke with a long program that included an attempt at a quadruple axel — something no skater has ever landed in competition.,But the Japanese “Ice Prince” tumbled twice, once while trying to nail the notoriously difficult jump.,Hanyu later admitted that he needed an injection of painkillers in order to lace up for his free skate.,“The pain was so strong during my morning practice that I wasn’t sure what I should do, but about 10 minutes before our six-minute warmup I received a painkiller shot and I was able to compete,” he said at a Feb. 14 news conference.,Despite the two falls, Hanyu’s free program was third-best among the 24 finalists — an improvement on his short program, which ranked eighth after his planned quad salchow was stymied by what he said was a hole in the ice.,“Honestly, it feels like everything has gone wrong this time around, but I did my best,” he told reporters after the competition, in which U.S. star Nathan Chen won gold.,Silver and bronze were taken by Japanese skaters Yuma Kagiyama and Shoma Uno.,Hanyu’s right ankle ligaments have given him trouble for years. He hurt the same ankle just months before the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, returning to the ice shortly before that event.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

I’ll do my best to show my playing style in the United States and contribute to the team,” Machida said.,Mystics General Manager and Head Coach Mike Thibault described the signing as “very exciting” for the franchise and called Machida one of the most dynamic point guards in the world.,“She pushes the tempo offensively and creates great opportunities for her teammates both in transition and in the half court,” he was quoted as saying on the team website.,“We can pair her with any of our guards to give us different looks with our lineups. Her teammates will love playing with her and our fans will love watching her play.”,Standing at just 162 centimeters, Machida played a starring role for Japan at the Tokyo Games and was singled out for praise by many opponents. She dished out an Olympic single-game record 18 assists in Japan’s semifinal victory over France.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,James Harden said Tuesday that he’s excited to play for the Philadelphia 76ers, who represent his third team in a 14-month span.,During that stretch, Harden ventured from the Houston Rockets to the Brooklyn Nets before the latter traded him to the Sixers on Thursday. The 32-year-old guard joined veteran forward Paul Millsap in being acquired by Philadelphia for guards Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, center Andre Drummond and a pair of first-round picks.,
,“It wasn’t planned like this,” Harden said during his introductory news conference on Tuesday. “Fourteen months ago, I didn’t see myself with three different teams, but we are where we are here today and I’m happy. Last year has been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of stress, but whatever, that’s in the past. I’m excited, I’m healthy, and it’s an opportunity of a lifetime.”,That opportunity includes playing with star center Joel Embiid, who is averaging an NBA-best 29.5 points per game entering play on Tuesday.,“I think we complement each other,” Harden said of Embiid. “Obviously, the whole world knows how great Joel’s been playing. Not just scoring the basketball, rebounding, he got a triple-double last game, his presence alone is unbelievable. I feel like I’m the same way as far as making my teammates better and doing different things to impact the game at the highest level.”,When asked if he could elevate the 76ers to a championship this season, Harden didn’t even wait for the question to be completed.,“Hell, yeah!” he said.,Harden has been nursing a strained left hamstring and hasn’t played since Feb. 2. The 76ers said he will continue his treatment and an update on his status will be given after the All-Star break.,On the season, Harden has played in 44 games, averaging 22.5 points, 10.2 assists and eight rebounds per game.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI, REUTERS,Somebody forgot to tell Stephen Curry that the three-point contest was Saturday.,The Golden State Warriors superstar put on a shooting clinic to lead Team LeBron to victory in the 2022 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.,
,LeBron James sank the game-winning basket as his side edged Team Durant 163-160, giving James his fifth straight all-star win as team captain.,But Curry was the brightest shooting star, winning the MVP award with a 50-point performance that included a record 16 3-pointers in front of a crowd of 19,400 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland.,He finished just two shy of Anthony Davis' 2017 single-game scoring record of 52 points, but shattered Paul George's previous record of nine threes, set in 2016.,""I tried, I tried,"" Curry said of flirting with the single-game scoring record.,""When I get going the energy picks up. It is pretty special being back in Ohio.,""Obviously this trophy has very special meaning. I am very humbled, very blessed and I appreciate it."",Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers had 36 points and 10 rebounds to lead Team Durant.,The All-Star Game was preceded by the three-point shooting contest on Saturday, a competition Curry won in 2021 in Chicago. Karl-Anthony Towns was this year's winner, as Curry did not enter.,James, a native of Ohio, nailed the winning shot with a fadeaway jumper to elevate Team LeBron to the target score of 163.,The 37-year-old was playing in his 18th All-Star game, which ties him with the late Kobe Bryant and moves him one shy of the record held by Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.,James was one of two captains, the other being Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, who did not attend the game due to the death of his grandmother earlier in the day.,Monty Williams of the Phoenix Suns coached Team LeBron while Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat coached Team Durant.,Ja Morant, the Memphis Grizzlies' rising star scored six points and was one of seven players making their All-Star debut.,The other first-timers were the Charlotte Hornets' LaMelo Ball, the Cleveland Cavaliers duo of Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland, the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins, the San Antonio Spurs' Dejounte Murray and the Toronto Raptors' Fred VanVleet.,The NBA honored its 75th Anniversary Team during halftime, with players from every decade of the league's existence in attendance for the diamond anniversary.,Curry caught fire when play resumed, knocking down five 3-pointers in just over two minutes. His second 3-pointer during the stretch was his 10th, which broke George's record.,Commissioner Adam Silver addressed the media as part of the All-Star festivities, telling reporters there is no ""silver bullet"" to fix the problem of NBA stars dictating where they want to play by demanding trades to playoff contenders.,Silver was asked if the league was investigating last week's swap between the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, which saw James Harden join his third team in two seasons.,""There are no silver bullets here,"" Silver said. ""There isn't any one aspect of the package where we can say, 'This will fix the problem.'"",In the aftermath of the blockbuster trade, some of Harden's peers called him out on social media, alleging the former league MVP wasn't injured and was simply trying to get out of Brooklyn. Others wondered if the Sixers tampered to convince Harden to force a trade from the Nets.,""He wasn't hurt,"" former NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady said. ""He shut it down. Y'all think he's hurt right now?… You don't rehab a hammy by doing stepbacks."",""We all know Philly was his first choice before he went to Brooklyn. So, when things hit the fan, he wanted out of there."",Silver was also asked about Ben Simmons, who in August 2021 demanded a trade out of Philadelphia and then stopped cooperating with the club.,Instead of trading him right away, the 76ers fined and suspended him, forcing him to miss dozens of games.,Simmons was finally dealt along with Andre Drummond, Seth Curry and two future first-round picks, to Brooklyn in exchange for Harden and Paul Millsap.,""I have expressed my unhappiness before with public trade demands,"" Silver said.,""We want players and teams to honor their contracts. In this case, we had two teams satisfied by the outcome of the trade."",In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Kyrie Irving could soon be available for home games in Brooklyn.,New York City mayor Eric Adams said he’s eager to end the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which would clear the way for the Nets to use their All-Star point guard in games at the Barclays Center. Irving has played in road games with the Nets but refused the COVID vaccine required for players in the New York home market.,
,Major cities are repealing mask and vaccine mandates with Philadelphia, Boston and soon Chicago among them.,“I take my hat off to New Yorkers through masks, vaccines, through social distancing. We were hit with the uncertainty, the fear of COVID. I’m very proud of how we responded,” Adams said Wednesday without providing a timeline or estimate of when the rules could change in New York.,“Every morning I meet with my health professionals because I always say I’m going to follow the science. I’m not going to get ahead of the science because I’m ready to get ahead of all of this and get back to a level of normalcy. But they’re giving us clear instructions. They gave us benchmarks, we’re going to follow those benchmarks. But I look forward to the next weeks going through a real transformation where I don’t have to wonder what you look like. We’re moving in the right direction. We’re going to do it in a safe way.”,Irving was approved to return and play in road games by the Nets on December 17. In 14 games this season, he’s averaging 24.1 points and 5.4 assists per game.,The Nets have 23 games remaining on their regular-season schedule, but 15 of them would be played without Irving due to the vaccine mandate.,Irving has recently received support from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and some league owners who criticized the mandate applying to players from the New York market but not to players visiting New York from other cities.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and WNBA champion, has been detained in Moscow on charges of carrying vape cartridges that contained cannabis oil in her luggage.,A statement on Saturday from the Russian Federal Customs Service announcing her arrest came as tensions between Moscow and the West have soared over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,
,It wasn’t clear exactly how long Griner had been in custody, with the customs service saying only that the arrest occurred “in February.”,According to the statement, an inspection of hand luggage carried by a U.S. citizen who arrived on a flight from New York “confirmed the presence of ‘vapes’ (and) a liquid with a specific smell.”,It said an expert had determined that the liquid was the narcotic cannabis oil (hashish oil) and said the charges carry a potential jail term of five-to-10 years.,The statement did not identify the jailed woman but said she was a two-time Olympic basketball champion for the United States and a player in the WNBA.,The customs service also released a video on Saturday in which airport security services are seen going through the luggage of a passenger who appears to be Griner.,USA Basketball, which oversees the Olympic teams, said on Twitter that it was “aware of and closely monitoring the legal situation facing Brittney Griner in Russia.”,It added: “Brittney has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball and her safety and well-being are our primary concerns.”,Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas of Wasserman Group, said in a statement issued to US media that the agency was in contact with Griner.,“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA,” she said.,“As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern.”,Griner, 31, led the Phoenix Mercury to the franchise’s third WNBA title in 2014 and a surprise return to the WNBA finals in October.,The 206-cm center has played for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason since 2015, helping the club to three Russian domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021.,Griner is among a majority of the 144 players on WNBA rosters who have played overseas in the North American league’s offseason.,Earnings at European clubs can far outstrip what players make in the United States. Griner has reportedly made as much as $1 million a year with UMMC, while the WNBA maximum is about $228,000.,A WNBA spokeswoman told the New York Times on Saturday that all WNBA players apart from Griner had left Russia and Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion of the neighboring country.,The Mercury, the WNBA and the WNBA Players Association all issued statements supporting Griner, the WNBA saying she had the league’s full support and our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States.”,The Mercury added: “We love and support Brittney, and at this time our main concern is her safety, physical and mental health, and her safe return home.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,Hachimura, who starred for the Japanese men’s Olympic team, predicted Machida would fit well in Washington.,“She’s a good player (and) I think she chose a good team,” Hachimura said in an online interview.,While Machida’s signing was announced in mid-February, Hachimura said he had learned about the deal roughly a month ago while speaking with a member of the Mystics coaching staff.,“I said (Machida) really stood out at the Olympics. I also mentioned that I wasn’t too bad either,” Hachimura laughed.,Having made a late start to his third NBA campaign after taking time off for personal reasons, the 24-year-old Hachimura has hit the second half of the season in strong shape.,He has given Wizards head coach Wes Unseld Jr. reliable scoring off the bench, hitting double digits in the last three games, including 19 in Friday’s 117-114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks.,“Coach has shown faith in me, so I want to repay that by playing to his expectations,” Hachimura said.,At 28-34, the Wizards are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference and once again battling for a place in the playoff play-in games involving the teams ranked seventh to 10th.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Diplomats were working to ensure the release of seven-time WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner after Russia said it detained the player last month for possession of vape cartridges containing hash oil, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.,The Russian Customs Service, without naming Griner, said on Saturday that it had detained an athlete in February after the player arrived at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York.,
,Russian news agency TASS identified the player as Griner, citing a source. Griner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, said: “We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia.”,A scan of the player’s luggage revealed cartridges containing “liquid with hashish oil,” and a criminal case has been opened carrying a possible sentence of five to 10 years in prison, the customs service said.,It was not clear when in February Griner, who plays in Russia during the WNBA offseason, was detained. The player is still in custody and an investigation is underway, the Russian Customs Service said.,Griner, who won Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national team in 2016 and 2021, “has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball,” USA Basketball said on Twitter.,At a joint press conference with Moldova President Maia Sandu on Sunday, Blinken said the Biden administration had assigned an embassy team to work on Griner’s case.,“There’s only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point,” Blinken said of Griner. “Whenever an American is detained anywhere in the world, we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance, and that includes in Russia.”,He added, “We have an embassy team that’s working on the cases of other Americans who are detained in Russia. We’re doing everything we can to see to it that their rights are upheld and respected.”,Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and Western nations’ sweeping sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow, the United States on Saturday warned against travel to Russia and said its embassy there had limited ability to assist citizens.,LGBTQ rights advocates expressed particular concern for Griner in light of the fact that she is an openly gay woman being detained in a country that has a record of restricting LGBTQ rights.,“Our thoughts are with Brittney Griner, her loved ones, and her teammates during this terrifying ordeal,” a spokesperson for Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ rights in sports, said on Sunday. “Brittney has long been a powerful voice for LGBTQ+ equality. It’s critical that now we use our collective voice to call for her safe and swift return to her family.”,Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, posted on Instagram on Saturday that she appreciated the prayers and support she had received following Brittney’s detention. “This message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life,” she wrote. “Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Major League Baseball has cancelled more preseason games, a sign that the start of the regular season could be further delayed as contract negotiations with players drag on.,Opening Day of the regular season, originally scheduled for March 31, has already been pushed back.,
,MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday that failure of the two sides to reach agreement on a series of economic issues left the league with no choice but to cancel the first two series of regular-season games.,The cancellation of preseason games at least through March 17 could have a knock-on effect leading to more regular-season cancellations.,Manfred has said that a four-week exhibition season is needed to guard against player injuries.,Some players, however, have indicated that a three-week preseason would be sufficient to prepare.,Spring Training was shortened to three weeks before the lockout-impacted 1990 season, strike-delayed 1995 season and pandemic-shortened 2020 season.,Players and owners departed Jupiter, Florida, on Tuesday after nine days of talks that failed to end the stalemate.,Owners had locked out players on Dec. 2 after the expiration of the previous collective bargaining agreement, saying the action would increase the sense of urgency in negotiations.,However, the players’ union chief negotiator Bruce Meyer said Tuesday there remained “major issues on which we were very far apart.”,That includes the competitive balance tax — which is MLB’s de facto salary cap, and salary levels for young players who are not yet eligible for salary arbitration.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Major League Baseball described negotiations with its locked-out players as “deadlocked” after a meeting on Sunday during which it said the union presented a proposal that “backtracked” on some issues.,The two sides met in New York for the first time since Tuesday, when MLB decided to cancel the first week of regular season games after a league-imposed deadline passed without an deal on a new collective bargaining agreement.,
,But MLB, which said it was hoping see some movement in its direction in order to gain additional flexibility to get a deal done quickly, walked away from the meeting unimpressed.,“The Players Association chose to come back to us with a proposal that was worse than Monday night and was not designed to move the process forward,” said MLB spokesman Glen Caplin.,“On some issues, they even went backwards. Simply put, we are deadlocked. We will try to figure out how to respond but nothing in this proposal makes it easy.”,The MLB Players Association did not immediately respond when asked for a comment on the latest talks, but according to reports one official denies the league’s assertion that the union moved backwards.,The two sides reportedly remain far apart on issues like luxury tax, minimum salaries and the pre-arbitration bonus pool, raising the possibility that more games could soon be canceled.,The 2022 season was scheduled to begin on March 31 and this year could mark the first games missed due to a labor dispute since the players’ strike of 1994-95.,That work stoppage forced a premature end to one season, delayed the start of the next year’s campaign and turned off fans, with attendances plummeting when play finally resumed.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Max Muncy said he expects to be fully recovered from an elbow injury and in the starting lineup on opening day — whenever that is and at whatever position.,Muncy sustained a left elbow injury in a collision at first base with Milwaukee’s Jace Peterson on Oct. 3, the final day of the regular season, and missed the entire postseason. Although the team didn’t initially confirm the severity of the injury, Muncy said in November that it was a torn ulnar collateral ligament that didn’t require Tommy John surgery.,
,In a recent guest appearance on AM 570 LA Sports radio in Los Angeles, Muncy said he was on track to play on opening day on March 31. The start of the season has been delayed because of the ongoing MLB lockout.,“I think even before the lockout it was looking like I’d be ready for opening day,” said Muncy, a two-time All-Star. “I still think we’re on track for that now. It’s feeling strong and healthy. It’s a little stiff, but that’s to be expected. We’re working through it and it should be good to go.”,Muncy, 31, had emerged as the Dodgers’ first baseman over the past few seasons, but he can also can play at second and third. With the departure of shortstop Corey Seager to the Texas Rangers in free agency, the Dodgers will need to shuffle their infield, moving Trea Turner from second base to shortstop. Muncy said he wouldn’t mind a move to second base.,Especially if that means the Dodgers sign Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman, a free agent who is at the top of a lot of teams’ wishlist.,Freeman, a Southern California native, won the National League MVP award in 2020 and the World Series with the Braves in 2021. A five-time All-Star, he’s a career .295 hitter with 271 home runs and 941 RBIs in 11-plus seasons in Atlanta.,Muncy said he’s always most enjoyed second base and would be happy to slide over to make way for Freeman.,“Imagine how dangerous we’d be if we get him in that lineup. It makes me really excited,” he said.,Muncy hit .249 last season and led the Dodgers with 36 home runs and 94 RBIs.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Major League Baseball canceled more games on Wednesday after a fresh round of marathon labor talks with players ended in a another deadlock.,MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the 2022 season would not start until April 14 at the earliest after the latest negotiations failed to yield a breakthrough.,
,“We worked hard to reach an agreement and offered a fair deal with significant improvements for the players and our fans,” Manfred said.,“I am saddened by this situation’s continued impact on our game and all those who are a part of it, especially our loyal fans.”,The 2022 season had been due to get under way on March 31 but has been pushed back after fruitless negotiations to end a lockout of players.,The sides met for 16 hours on Tuesday, with the talks wrapping up in the early hours of Wednesday morning.,A similarly protracted round of late-night negotiations also ended without an agreement last week, prompting MLB chiefs to cancel the opening weekend of games — marking the first time in 27 years regular season games have been lost to due to a labor dispute.,Players and team owners have been wrangling over the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement since February.,Players have been locked out by club owners since the previous labor deal expired on Dec. 1, 2021.,In his statement on Wednesday, Manfred said teams had gone to “extraordinary lengths” to meet the demands of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), baseball’s players union.,“In a last-ditch effort to preserve a 162-game season, this week we have made good-faith proposals that address the specific concerns voiced by the MLBPA and would have allowed the players to return to the field immediately,” Manfred said.,“The clubs went to extraordinary lengths to meet the substantial demands of the MLBPA. On the key economic issues that have posed stumbling blocks, the clubs proposed ways to bridge gaps to preserve a full schedule.,“Regrettably, after our second late-night bargaining session in a week, we remain without a deal.,“Because of the logistical realities of the calendar, another two series are being removed from the schedule, meaning that Opening Day is postponed until April 14th.,“We have the utmost respect for our players and hope they will ultimately choose to accept the fair agreement they have been offered.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Major League Baseball and its locked-out players reached an agreement on Thursday on a labor deal that ends the second-longest work stoppage in the game’s history.,MLB had initiated a player lockout in December, with months of either silence or flurries of activity on the labor negotiation front following since. At one point, the league set a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 28 to come to an agreement, past which they would have to cancel the first two weeks of games for the 2022 season — originally scheduled to begin on March 31. That deadline came and went, along with the announcement of game cancellations.,
,For the time being the bitter negotiations are now a thing of the past following Thursday’s agreement, but the process has left a bad taste in the mouths of many fans, and likely the players as well.,“I am genuinely thrilled to be able to say that Major League Baseball is back and we’re going to play 162 games,” said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, opening a press conference with an apology to fans.,“I know that the last few months have been difficult. There (was) a lot of uncertainty at a point in time when there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world,” he said.,Team owners voted to ratify the agreement just hours after the players approved the new five-year labor pact.,According to a report on MLB’s website, the pact is expected to include increased minimum salaries, a new pre-arbitration bonus pool to reward top young players and a raising of the competitive balance tax threshold.,Spring training camps will open on Sunday and a full 162-game regular season is to begin on April 7. Double-headers have been added to the schedule to make up games that would have been played from a March 31 Opening Day.,“Our union endured the second-longest work stoppage in its history to achieve significant progress in key areas that will improve not just current players’ rights and benefits, but those of generations to come,” MLB Players Association (MLBPA) Executive Director Tony Clark said in a statement.,“Players remained engaged and unified from beginning to end, and in the process re-energized our fraternity,” Clark said,The final vote from the executive sub-committee and 30 players representative was 26-12 in favor of the new collective bargaining agreement, ESPN reported.,
,While the deal paves the way for the return of America’s pastime, bitter acrimony remains between the two sides.,Clark last week called the lockout the “ultimate economic weapon” against the athletes.,Manfred defended the move on Thursday, calling it “the most effective way” to reach a new agreement without losing games when a deal was not in place at the expiration of the previous pact. But he acknowledged there was work to be done to repair the league’s relationship with its on-field talent.,“One of the things I’m supposed to do is promote a good relationship with our players. I’ve tried to do that. I think that I have not been successful in that,” he said.,He said the league compromised on its proposed 14-team playoffs and made other concessions to MLB players.,“I do believe — I hope — that the players will see the effort we made to address their concerns in this agreement as an olive branch,” said Manfred.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,Kikuchi will reportedly earn $16 million in 2022 and $10 million in each of the 2023 and 2024 seasons.,The former Seibu Lions star reportedly turned down a $13 million player option to return to Seattle.,Kikuchi went 7-9 with a 4.41 ERA in 157 innings over 29 starts in a 2021 season in which he was selected to the All-Star Game but faded down the stretch.

			,AFP-Jiji,Cricket superstar Shane Warne died of natural causes, Thai police said Monday, as his family lamented a “tragedy we will never come to terms with.”,The legendary Australian leg-spinner died on the Thai holiday island of Koh Samui on Friday after being found unresponsive at a luxury villa.,
,Initial reports suggested the 52-year-old suffered a heart attack and autopsy results on Monday confirmed he died of natural causes.,“Investigators received an autopsy report today in which a forensic doctor concludes the death was due to natural causes,” Krissana Pattanacharoen, deputy national police spokesman, said in a statement.,He said Warne’s family had been informed of the result and accepted it.,“Investigators will conclude the autopsy reports and send them to state prosecutor as soon as possible,” Krissana added.,Surachate Hakparn, assistant to the national police chief, said investigators had found no signs of violence at the villa where Warne was found.,“His father said he (Warne) had been suffering chest pains and was planning to return home for a check-up after this trip,” Surachate told reporters in Koh Samui.,Warne’s unexpected death sparked an outpouring of grief from prime ministers, rock stars and fellow athletes.,The player — one of the greatest test cricketers of all time — was found after failing to meet friends.,He was taken to the Thai International Hospital Samui but despite medical efforts he could not be revived.,Officials said his body will now be transported to Bangkok to be handed over to diplomats for repatriation to Australia, where he is to be honoured with a state funeral.,In their first public comments since the death on Friday, Warne’s parents, brother, children and ex-wife expressed deep sorrow, paying tribute to one of the greatest Test cricketers of all time and the man they loved.,“To find words to adequately express our sadness is an impossible task for us and looking to a future without Shane is inconceivable,” parents Keith and Brigitte Warne said in a statement.,“I miss you so much already,” said daughter Summer Warne. “I wish I could’ve hugged you tighter in what I didn’t know were my final moments with you.”,“I wish I could’ve told you that everything was going to be OK and hold your hand.”,Son Jackson Warne reminisced about playing golf and poker, and watching Australian rules football while eating pizza with someone he saw as a brother and best friend, as well as a father.,“I love you so much. I don’t think anything is ever going to fill the void you have left in my heart,” he said in a statement.,“You were truly the best father and mate anyone could’ve asked for. I love you so much Dad, see you soon.”,Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison led tributes to one of the country’s “greatest characters” and announced Warne would receive a full state funeral.,Over the weekend fans paid homage to Warne at the Melbourne Cricket Ground — including offerings of cigarettes, beer and meat pies — to remember an extraordinary cricketing talent with a huge appetite for life.,Credited with reviving the art of leg-spin, Warne was part of a dominant Australian Test team in the 1990s and 2000s and helped his country win the 1999 limited-overs World Cup.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,The fourth season of “Drive to Survive,” the Netflix docu-series that has turbocharged Formula One for new and younger audiences, debuts on Friday with the sport still committed to the “marriage” despite controversy and criticism.,The 10 new episodes offer behind the scenes insight into the 2021 season, one of grand prix racing’s most exciting and closely-fought championships.,
,“I think it’s a great partnership,” Greg Maffei, CEO of Formula One’s U.S.-based owners Liberty Media, told analysts in a recent conference call.,“It’s been a win all the way around. Clearly grown our sport, not only in the U.S. but around the world. It is a great thing for Netflix as well. So I hope the marriage continues for a long time.”,Cumulative television viewership in the United States was up 58% year-on-year in 2021, according to F1 figures, with 400,000 fans making the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, the best-attended race of last season.,A second U.S. race, in Miami, will debut in May and U.S.-based sponsors, such as Red Bull’s new title partner Oracle, are increasingly prominent.,The Netflix partnership has had its critics, however, with last year’s final showdown in Abu Dhabi triggering accusations that the sport’s integrity had been sacrificed for entertainment.,Race director Michael Masi, since replaced, changed the safety car procedures in a late move that allowed Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to win and deny Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton a record eighth title.,McLaren’s Lando Norris said afterwards he felt it was done “for the TV.”,Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, playing a starring role in a series snubbed by Verstappen who said last year he felt some of the driver rivalries were “faked,” felt the criticism was unfair.,“F1 is still a sport, but sport is an entertainment,” he told the BBC.,“And one could also argue that there have been more people talking about Formula One in the past two and a half months when, traditionally, it would have been in hibernation.”,Much of that talk has also been about what might ultimately be revealed by the Netflix cameras.,Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali recognized, however, that “Drive to Survive” needed to remain a “differentiating factor” with other sports jumping on the bandwagon in a bid to boost audiences.,Amazon Prime will launch a similar MotoGP Unlimited docu-series on March 14 while the Netflix producers have teamed up with tennis’s Grand Slam tournaments and ATP and WTA tours and are also reportedly in discussions with cycling’s Tour de France.,“If it’s becoming just a different way to speak about Formula One without … giving to the F1 platform any added value maybe I think it’s better to renegotiate and see with Netflix or with the other partners what could be a possibility to do something different in the future,” Domenicali said.,“But for sure this platform has been a vital point on the growth of awareness, mainly with the young generation and newcomers.”,The 2022 Formula One season starts in Bahrain on March 20.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Ministers from 37 nations signed a joint statement on Tuesday calling for additional sporting sanctions to be imposed on Russia and Belarus following the invasion of Ukraine.,The statement, organized by the British government, followed a virtual summit convened by Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston on March 3.,
,France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada and the United States are among the other signatories.,“Russia’s unprovoked and unjustifiable war of choice against Ukraine, enabled by the Belarusian government, is abhorrent and a flagrant breach of its international obligations,” the statement said.,“Respect for human rights and peaceful relations between nations form the foundation of international sport.”,The statement also called for Russia and Belarus not to be permitted to “host, bid for or be awarded any international sporting events.”,And it said any ban should also be extended to individual athletes selected by Russia and Belarus administrators, as well as teams or cities “effectively representing” the states such as major soccer clubs.,Welcoming the recent decision by the International Paralympic Committee to ban both Russia and Belarus athletes from the Winter Paralympics in Beijing, the statement said: “These restrictions should be in place until cooperation under the fundamental principles of international law has become possible again.”,Earlier on Tuesday, sport’s top court said the Football Union of Russia had lodged appeals against the suspension of Russian national teams and clubs from all FIFA and UEFA competitions over the invasion of Ukraine.,The FUR is asking the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a stay of execution for the suspensions, in order to allow Russia to play in a 2022 World Cup playoff against Poland scheduled for March 24.,CAS said it had initiated two separate arbitration procedures involving soccer’s global governing body FIFA and European counterpart UEFA respectively, as well as 15 national federations that have refused to play against Russia.,The court added it would give further information on the proceedings in the next few days once it had ruled on each decision the Russians are challenging.,FIFA said later Tuesday it had agreed, in a “spirit of solidarity,” to Ukraine’s request to postpone its 2022 World Cup playoff against Scotland this month following Russia’s invasion.,Ukraine was set to face Scotland at Glasgow’s Hampden Park on March 24 in a playoff semifinal that will now be staged in June.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Hockey star Alex Ovechkin, center among Russian professional athletes in the public’s anger over the war in Ukraine, played before the most unsympathetic crowd yet.,Ovechkin, President Vladimir Putin’s high-profile supporter, and his Washington Capitals teammates faced the Oilers on Wednesday night in Edmonton, Alberta, home to one of Canada’s largest concentrations of the Ukrainian diaspora.,
,Andriy Tovstiuk of Edmonton works with the Ukrainian Canadian Congress organizing fundraising, rallies, demonstrations and humanitarian relief efforts in Alberta for Ukraine. He was at Wednesday’s game at Rogers Place.,“I think we’re going to be loud, we’re going to be fired up,” said Tovstiuk, whose organization is working with both the Oilers and the Calgary Flames to raise money for Ukraine through its 50-50 draws, which frequently hit more than $1 million. “But we’re all really wanting to focus on supporting Ukraine and really getting behind everything that’s going on right now.,“It’s an emotional time for everybody, and we really encourage everybody to use this as a rallying point for Ukraine.”,Ovechkin is one of Russia’s most famous athletes, and his friendship with Putin, who has a singular passion for ice hockey, is widely known. The friendship was unwavering after Putin invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, with Ovechkin starting an online social movement in 2017 to support Putin winning the 2018 Russian election.,Edmonton is home to 160,000 people of Ukrainian descent, and there are 370,000 in Alberta, according to the 2016 Canadian census. There are roughly 1.4 million people of Ukrainian background living in Canada, more than anywhere outside Ukraine and Russia.,Officials from the Capitals, who have four Russian players on their roster including Ovechkin, had discussed security measures at Rogers Place with their Oilers counterparts. The Oilers did not respond to requests for comment. The Capitals declined to speak on the record.,Tim Shipton, an executive vice president of Oilers Entertainment Group, issued a statement Monday: “The Edmonton Oilers stand in solidarity alongside the people of Ukraine. As we saw during Saturday’s home game, Oilers fans were very respectful in showing their support for Ukraine.”,On Wednesday night, Viter, a Ukrainian folk choir, performed the Canadian anthem in English and Ukrainian. Oilers players continued to sport Ukrainian flag stickers on their helmets. Fans wearing the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag dotted the stands and hung flags throughout the arena. Every time Ovechkin touched the puck, he was loudly booed. He did not score, and Edmonton won, 4-3, in overtime on a goal from star center Connor McDavid.,On Tuesday, before their first game of the season in Alberta, the Capitals issued a statement saying they “join the National Hockey League in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the loss of innocent life.” The statement continued: “We urge and hope for a peaceful resolution as quickly as possible. The Capitals also stand in full support of our Russian players and their families overseas. We realize they are being put in a difficult situation and stand by to offer our assistance to them and their families.”,Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ovechkin, who is one of the NHL’s biggest stars — two goals in a 5-4 victory on Tuesday against the Flames tied him for third on the career goals list with Jaromir Jagr at 766 — has been jeered and booed during road games. His image was even scorned in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday when he appeared in a tribute video for former Blue Jackets star Rick Nash.,Ovechkin held a news conference Feb. 25 intended to distance himself from Putin and support for the Russian invasion. “I am not in politics. Like, I’m an athlete,” he said. He added, without mentioning Putin, “Please, no more war.”,Instead of calming his detractors, Ovechkin found himself under criticism from supporters of the war in his home country and opponents of it in the rest of the world. This resulted in a severe backlash on Ovechkin’s social media accounts from Russian supporters, and he was advised not to change his Instagram profile picture because it would not go over well in Russia.,That is why Ovechkin’s profile picture, showing him with Putin, on his verified Instagram account, which has 1.6 million followers, remained as of Wednesday afternoon. There was a plan to change the picture to a symbol for world peace after the news conference, but since Ovechkin’s wife, two children and parents are in Russia, it was decided the photo of him and Putin would stay.,Ovechkin and Flames defenseman Nikita Zadorov are the only Russian players to publicly mention the war. Zadorov posted a Ukrainian flag emoji and the words “No war” and “STOP IT!!!” on Instagram the day after the invasion.,According to player agent Dan Milstein, who represents dozens of Russian and Belarusian players with NHL contracts, his clients and their families are facing a barrage of abuse and profanity on platforms like Instagram and Twitter.,“I have had wives of my players receiving very disturbing messages,” Milstein said. “The comments under children’s pictures are Nazi baby, get back to Russia, we don’t need you here, go home, among other things.”,Milstein, who is a native of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was the only person connected with the NHL who would agree to speak on the record for this article, with others citing fear of repercussions for associates or clients who have family members in Russia.,An NHL spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment from Commissioner Gary Bettman. But the league is working with police services in some of its 32 team cities to provide extra patrols around the arenas and homes of players.,Milstein said his Russian clients on NHL rosters want nothing to do with the war in Ukraine but fear the consequences of speaking out.,“Of course, they’re worried not only about their families but also they are extremely worried about what is happening in Russia,” he said. “My clients don’t want the war, my clients want world peace. My clients are concerned for all the people in Ukraine and Russia, everybody.”,Hockey equipment maker CCM said last week it would stop using Ovechkin and other Russian players in global marketing campaigns.,Russian and Belarusian players and teams have been barred from all international competitions by the International Ice Hockey Federation. They also face calls for sanctions from fans, some governments and even Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky.,Gretzky, 61, and still one of the most influential people in hockey, called for Russia to be barred from the rescheduled 2022 men’s world junior tournament shortly before the IIHF barred the country. He later explained on the Toronto radio station Sportsnet 590 that he was thinking of the large numbers of people of Ukrainian descent who live in Canada, especially Edmonton, where the tournament will be played in August.,“I just couldn’t relate to how we were going to welcome a country that is at war, to a city that has tons of Ukrainian family members that are still living in Ukraine,” said Gretzky, who won four Stanley Cup championships with Edmonton. “And I got some pushback from people that said, ‘Why punish the Russian kids?’,“It’s not about punishing the Russian kids. What about the Ukrainian kids that are being killed daily? The Ukrainian kids that are 12 or 14 years old, going to war. I don’t want anybody to be punished. I just think it makes common sense that we shouldn’t compete against this country right now, while they’re at war against an innocent country.”,Last week, the NHL condemned the Russian invasion in an official statement and said it was immediately suspending business relationships in Russia. The league suspended ties with the Kontinental Hockey League, which is largely based in Russia, this week. NHL teams were told to stop communications with KHL teams and agents based in Russia.,The NHL statement also made clear the league’s position on Russian players, saying they “play in the NHL on behalf of their NHL clubs, and not on behalf of Russia.”,Milstein and other player agents said barring Russian NHL players made no sense and would play into the hands of Putin, who continues the Russian government tradition of using elite athletes as propaganda.,The player agents also criticized the Canadian Hockey League, the umbrella group that oversees the three major junior leagues. The CHL recently announced it canceled this year’s Russia-Canada series. It is also considering a ban on Russian and Belarusian prospects from its import draft, which distributes teenage players from countries outside North America to CHL teams. Doing so, Milstein said, would essentially help Russia, which has reluctance over athletes playing elsewhere.,While some observers critical of Ovechkin, like Hall of Fame goaltender Dominik Hasek, would like him barred for his support of Putin, others think suspending him and other Russians would not help the situation.,Slava Malamud, a teacher in Baltimore who was a journalist for many years in Russia, has a strong following on social media as a staunch critic of Ovechkin. While Malamud said he would not have a problem with Ovechkin’s being barred from the NHL because of his support for Putin, he did not think punishing all Russian players would be fair.,“We’re not punishing Russians for being Russian,” he said. “You can’t help where you are born. But players who have explicitly supported Putin, first and foremost Ovechkin, have this on their conscience. He is stained by this. He did it very willingly.”,

			,Kyodo,Artistic gymnastics great Kohei Uchimura had his last hurrah on Saturday, as the 2012 and 2016 Olympic men’s all-around gold medalist retired after performing at a packed Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.,The winner of a staggering 40 straight tournaments in the all-around at home and abroad from 2008 through 2017, Uchimura made one last appearance in a unique event dubbed “Kohei Uchimura the Final,” joined by his nine Japan teammates and a crowd of around 6,500, including his mother and father.,
,Uchimura turned back the clock in his grand finale, performing on each apparatus for the first time since August 2019, when injuries to both shoulders forced him to stop competing in the six-apparatus all-around.,A six-time individual all-around world champion, Uchimura announced the event when he told a Jan. 14 press conference he would retire after a unique farewell exhibition.,“I really want to say thank you to everyone who supported me up till this day,” he said after being tossed in the air six times by other guest gymnasts, including Kenzo Shirai, with whom he won team gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and Tokyo Games all-around champion Daiki Hashimoto.,“It’s been 30 years since I started gymnastics, and there’s only been arduousness. But the joy of winning with my Japan teammates here, as well as individually, and that of learning new techniques eventually began to eclipse that.,“My entire body has been aching since I’ve finished. Half of me is saying it was a good call to retire, the other half says I can still carry on.”,While no scores were awarded for the day’s performances, Uchimura was close to his impeccable best. He nailed the smooth landings that have defined his career on the floor exercise, pommel horse and rings as two other gymnasts joined him on each apparatus.,A solid parallel bars routine was sandwiched by a slight step out on his vault and horizontal bar landings. He sparkled once more, however, by nailing a Bretschneider on the horizontal bar, the apparatus’ most difficult move.,At the Tokyo Games, he fell and made an early exit, while he finished sixth on the apparatus at October’s world championships, held in his birthplace of Kitakyushu, before deciding to call it a career.,“I was too close to the bar with all the release moves, and I couldn’t nail the landing at the end. That’s why this event was called ‘the Final,'” joked Uchimura.,“I’m giving myself a mark of 60 (out of 100). I was made aware again of how grueling it is to compete on six apparatuses. It was frightening to think I used to do them perfectly.,“I wanted to carry on forever, but my horizontal bar wasn’t so great at the Olympics and world championships last year, and today also. I had felt it was about the right time.”,It was a fitting stage to bow out for a man nicknamed the “king” of the sport with his fellow 2016 team gold medalists and 2020 Tokyo games gymnasts from Japan joining the action.,“As long as I live, I’ll never forget performing together on the horizontal bar in your final performance,” said 20-year-old Hashimoto, the heir to Uchimura’s all-around title, who is expected to lead Japanese artistic gymnastics in the years ahead.,“I’m coming to grips with the size of what you’ve built after seeing how big an impact your retirement is having on the world of gymnastics at home and abroad. I can’t believe I’m speaking these words to someone I used to watch on TV.”,“We’ll inherit what you’ve done for us and try to get the team gold in Paris to prove to the world Japan is the best.”,Shirai, the 25-year-old Rio Games vault bronze medalist, retired last June but made a special comeback and electrified the crowd with the twisting techniques that bear his name on the floor and vault.,“Thank you for giving everyone dreams, hope and courage,” said Shirai, who was 10 when Uchimura spotted his talent. “What you are going to do next is filling the hearts of gymnasts and fans alike with excitement.”,Uchimura, who also won team silver at the 2012 London Games, reiterated his desire to pass on his experience and help Japanese artistic gymnastics evolve, vowing to remain in the limelight in a new capacity.,“I’ve seen many people crying, but I’m really positive as I see this as not an end but a new step,” said Uchimura, who thanked his parents for giving him his strong body.,“I can still move and will convey to younger gymnasts how to pursue techniques in ways only I can offer … I want to be the one who knows most about gymnastics. I want to research it, popularize it and increase its value within society.,“I’ve enjoyed one happy career as a gymnast.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,French judo great Teddy Riner will resume competing in July after a post-Olympics break, and has his sights set on the 2024 Paris Games, where the 32-year-old dreams of winning one last gold, he says.,The 10-time world champion, who holds the most world titles in the history of the sport, said during a training session in Rio de Janeiro he would return to competition at the Budapest Grand Slam from July 8 to 10.,
,“We’ll see how that first tournament goes. I’m giving myself time. I’d like to go to the world championships in October (in Tashkent, Uzbekistan), but we’ll see,” he said in an interview Friday, taking a break from his first international training session since his six-month hiatus.,One thing is certain: Despite an aging body and struggles with injury, he wants to compete before a home crowd at the Paris Olympics before he calls it quits, he said.,“My whole family, all my friends are going to be in the stadium. It will be like having an extra lung,” said the 204-centimeter heavyweight, who currently weighs in at around 148 kilos.,“But I’m not putting pressure on myself. There’s a long road to travel. I have to train, because I wouldn’t want to disappoint, but above all because I want to really enjoy this last competition.”,The three-time Olympic gold medalist, who had to settle for bronze in Tokyo but managed to help France to team gold, said a final gold in Paris would be “the pinnacle” of his career.,“But whatever happens, I won’t be disappointed. I’ve had the career I’ve had, and I’m grateful to everyone who has helped make it possible,” he said.,“Whatever happens now is a bonus. No stress. I want to push the limits and shine in front of the home crowd, win the most beautiful medal of all. But whatever is meant to be will be.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska reached the Lyon WTA quarterfinals on Thursday, less than a week after escaping Russian bomb attacks on her home city of Odessa, and insisted: “I want to win for my country”.,The 21-year-old arrived on court with a Ukraine flag draped around her shoulders and was celebrating a comfortable 6-2, 6-3 win over Spain’s Cristina Bucsa just over an hour later,
,“I was very nervous because I want to win the matches for my country. This tournament is very emotional for me. But I’m very happy with the win today,” Yastremska, a former top-25 player now ranked 140th, said on court.,“I was able to control my emotions better than in my first match and that’s why I was able to deliver a good performance.,At her postmatch news conference, she added: “This is another victory for me and another victory for my country. We’ll see what happens on Friday (in the quarterfinals), if I can raise my physical level.”,In her opening match on Tuesday, she had to save two match points in a marathon win against Ana Bogdan.,Afterwards, she spoke of how she was “woken up by bombs” when Russia invaded Ukraine last week, before embarking on an arduous journey to France.,Her father and mother remained in the Black Sea port city of Odessa after saying goodbye to their daughters when they crossed the Danube by boat to reach Romania.,Yastremska, who has won three WTA titles but none since May 2019, also played doubles in Lyon with her 15-year-old sister Ivanna on Monday.,“On Wednesday, we were at home in Odessa. We were spending time with our family before making this long trip to Lyon with my father,” she explained.,“The evening was pleasant, but the next morning we were woken up by bombs.,“We didn’t realize or understand what was going on.

			,Reuters,Men’s tennis governing body has handed world No. 3 Alexander Zverev a suspended eight-week ban for smashing his racket against the umpire’s chair at last month’s ATP 500 event in Acapulco, for which he was expelled from the tournament.,Zverev was fined $20,000 for verbal abuse, $20,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and forfeited more than $31,000 in prize money and all rankings points earned from singles and doubles action at the Abierto Mexicano tournament.,
,Following a review, the ATP found the 24-year-old German had committed “aggravated behavior” and issued an additional fine of $25,000 and an eight-week ban from any ATP-sanctioned event.,The ATP said, however, the ban and the additional fine were suspended, providing that over a probation period ending one year after the incident, Zverev does not incur any more fines for unsportsmanlike conduct.,After losing in doubles at Acapulco and upset over a line call in the match, Zverev approached umpire Alessandro Germani’s chair and came perilously close to hitting him as he swung at the official’s stand before heading towards his courtside seat.,The 2020 U.S. Open runner-up then approached the chair a second time and again hit it while shouting expletives.,Shortly before the match ended, Germani handed Zverev a code violation for yelling and swearing in protest of the shot that was ruled in and set up match point.,Zverev, who was the singles defending champion, apologized for his behaviour.,The biggest penalty in men’s tennis to date was handed down to Australian Nick Kyrgios in 2019 for verbally abusing a chair umpire and smashing two rackets. After an initial fine of $113,000, he was given a suspended ban of 16 weeks and an additional fine of $25,000 following an ATP investigation.,Italy’s Fabio Fognini was also provisionally suspended for two Grand Slam tournaments and fined $96,000 following the 2017 U.S. Open where he had directed vulgar language toward Swedish chair umpire Louise Engzell during his first-round loss.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Red-hot Rafael Nadal will be the man to beat when Indian Wells kicks off this week while Naomi Osaka will look to begin her ascent back to the top of the tennis world at the tournament that launched her career.,Nadal’s season was cut short last year due to a foot injury but the Spaniard has come roaring out of the gates in 2022, winning January’s Australian Open for a men’s record 21st Grand Slam title.,
,He followed that up by winning his fourth title in Acapulco last month and has not lost in 15 matches this season.,“Rafa Nadal is now 35 years old and he’s never had a start to the season like this one,” Indian Wells tournament director and former player Tommy Haas said on a recent podcast.,“He’s the guy to beat here, there’s no doubt about it. And he obviously enjoys it here very much,” Haas said of Nadal, who has won the Masters 1000 tournament three times.,As a bonus, while in the Southern California desert, Nadal will stay at tournament owner and billionaire Larry Ellison’s private resort, Porcupine Creek Golf Club.,“He can play 18 to 36 holes of golf every day if he wants to,” Haas said.,“He likes it there and wants to stay for as long as he can. If he’s healthy, watch out.”,His Serbian rival Novak Djokovic was placed into the tournament’s draw on Tuesday despite his ongoing refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine, which would bar the world number two from entry into the country.,“Novak Djokovic is on the tournament entry list, and therefore is placed into the draw today,” tournament organisers wrote on Twitter Tuesday.,“We are currently in communication with his team; however, it has not been determined if he will participate in the event by getting CDC approval to enter the country.”,Swiss Roger Federer will not be at the tournament as he is still recovering from knee surgery, while a cadre of emerging stars will be eager to topple Nadal.,Chief among them is Daniil Medvedev, who enters a tournament as the world number one for the first time, and big-serving Andrey Rublev, who won a title in Dubai last month.,Both players are from Russia but they will not compete under the name or flag of their country, a decision handed down by tennis authorities following Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine.,“There are a lot of guys knocking on the door but Nadal has got to be the favorite,” Haas said.,
,On the women’s side, opportunity knocks for Naomi Osaka, who as a 20-year-old announced herself with a triumph at the WTA 1000 event in 2018.,From there she won four Grand Slams, became the world’s highest-paid female athlete and sparked a conversation about mental health in sports.,But time away from the court after last year’s U.S. Open has caused her world ranking to plummet and the former world number one is now No. 78 and unseeded at the tournament.,“I’ve heard she’s in a wonderful place, a much better space than she was last year, and that she’s excited to get back out and competing,” three-time grand slam champion Lindsay Davenport said.,Osaka, who fell in the third round at the Australian Open, will face an in-form Sloane Stephens in a first-round blockbuster on Wednesday.,“That’s a really tough one to start off with, and Osaka is going to have to be ready to go,” Davenport said.,“I think she was a little disappointed with how Australia went and that she’s pretty motivated, but it’s going to take a lot of work.”,Davenport predicted a big year for Osaka and said her powerful game translates well on grass.,“If I were on her team, I would put a focus on trying to get her to believe that she could win Wimbledon.”,Osaka will not have to worry about facing world number one Ash Barty or top-ranked American Danielle Collins after both players withdrew from Indian Wells due to injury.,The tournament, which is officially called the BNP Paribas Open, returns to its March date on the calendar after being canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and being moved to October last year.,Full stands are expected at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden for what is sometimes referred to as the sport’s “fifth major.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka returns to Indian Wells, the scene of her breakthrough triumph in 2018, with a new outlook on a tennis career that plunged into turmoil in 2021.,The Japanese star will take the court for the first time since a third-round exit in her Australian Open title defense in January when she faces Sloane Stephens, the 2017 U.S. Open champion, in a first-round match at the prestigious hardcourt tournament in the California desert.,
,Osaka said she feels a new sense of confidence after her well-documented struggles in 2021 — which put a spotlight on the mental health of athletes in a wide range of sports.,She said even her loss to American Amanda Anisimova in Melbourne reassured her she was on the right path.,“Honestly, I feel like I’m at peace with myself, which I think is a great feeling to have as a person,” Osaka said Wednesday.,“For me, the biggest focus this year is, of course, I want to do well in every tournament,” she added.,“But I think just knowing that I tried as hard as I could and I enjoyed myself … I felt the difference in Australia.,“I actually left the court thinking, ‘You know what, I did my best.’ And I had match points. That was pretty good.”,Osaka withdrew from the French Open last year and skipped Wimbledon, saying she had struggled with depression. She was eliminated early at the Tokyo Olympics. She then made a tearful early exit at the U.S. Open and announced she would take a hiatus from tennis.,“I’ve learned to enjoy my time more,” she said. “This moment in my life, playing tennis, I’ve trained my entire life for it. But when I’m 70, it will probably be a small chapter for me. So I have to enjoy it while I still can.,“I’m just trying to appreciate every tournament.”,Osaka said she’d been encouraged not only by her own ability to enjoy herself more since her return to the court, but also by the new expectations of fans she’s encountered as she goes about her pre-tournament business at Indian Wells.,“I’m really grateful because I was watching qualifying the other day here and was walking around and usually when I walk around, people are like ‘win the tournament, I have tickets to the final’ kind of thing,” Osaka said.,“And, actually people were just saying, ‘I hope you have fun.’ I know that’s not the biggest difference, but it really meant a lot to me.”,Osaka said she doesn’t “live in the past anymore” but acknowledged it was nice to be back in Indian Wells, the WTA 1000 tournament she won in 2018 to claim her first title,Osaka was unseeded then, beating top-ranked Simona Halep in the semifinals on the way to what was the biggest title of her career.,In her first appearance in three years, she is in rebuild mode. Her Australian Open exit saw her drop out of the top-80 in the world and she drew a tough first-round clash against Stephens — who ended a four-year title drought with a victory in Guadalajara two weeks ago.,“I’m going to have to put a lot of energy into that,” Osaka said.,Although neither enjoys the first-round bye afforded the top 32 seeds, Osaka and Stephens are among the biggest names in a field that is missing top-ranked Ashleigh Barty and world No. 2 Barbora Krejcikova.,Barty withdrew saying she had not yet recovered from her triumphant Australian Open campaign, and the woman she beat in the Melbourne final, American Danielle Collins, was also a late withdrawal with an unspecified injury.,Krejcikova, the reigning French Open champion, pulled out with an elbow injury.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Naomi Osaka battled windy conditions and an in-form Sloane Stephens to earn a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 first round victory at Indian Wells on Thursday.,In a showdown of former U.S. Open champions, Osaka struggled in the first set amid the mighty gusts in her first match since January.,
,After a lackluster first set, Osaka turned a switch in the second, racing out to a 4-0 lead as her serve and defense suddenly improved.,Osaka pounced on a short ball from Stephens and her swinging backhand volley caught the line to even the match at a set apiece.,Stephens, who won a title in Guadalajara last month, held a 2-0 lead and had break point chances for 3-0 in the third but failed to convert.,That would prove crucial as Osaka seized the momentum to take the final six games, sealing her first career win over the American when her forehand failed to clear the net on match point.,“I haven’t played in wind in a while so this was very new to me,” Osaka said in an on-court interview on the Stadium Court.,“I felt like I was fighting for my life. I was playing against her, I was playing against this wind. It was crazy.,“But I kept thinking that she was going through the same circumstances as me, so I just have to will myself to try as hard as I could.”,A four-time Grand Slam champion, the Japanese former world number one has seen her ranking fall to 78 coming into the tournament after she took a break from tennis after last year’s U.S. Open to prioritize her mental health.,Prior to the start of the tournament that she won in 2018, she said she had a new perspective on tennis and is “at peace with myself.”,Next up for Osaka is a second round match against Veronika Kudermetova.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka was reduced to tears by a heckler Saturday on the way to a 6-0, 6-4 second-round loss to Veronika Kudermetova at Indian Wells.,Japan’s Osaka, ranked 78th in the world after her third-round exit at the Australian Open, was rocked early in the first set when someone in the crowd yelled “Naomi, you suck.”,
,She was unable to convince the chair umpire to take action and at 0-3 down her emotions spilled over.,Osaka quickly pulled herself together and resumed the match, but even though she raised her game in the second set she could find no answer for Kudermetova, a finalist this year at the Melbourne Summer Set and in Dubai.,Osaka put athlete mental health in the spotlight in a difficult 2021 in which she revealed she had suffered depression.,But speaking on court after the match she said it wasn’t that she found the comment so hurtful that she was upset, but because it reminded her of Venus and Serena Williams being heckled at Indian Wells in 2001.,“To be honest I feel like I’ve been heckled before it didn’t really bother me,” she said.,“But, like, I’ve watched a video of Venus and Serena being heckled here.,“If you’ve never watched it you should watch it,” she added, tearing up again before she congratulated Kudermetova on the win and departed the court.,Kudermetova, who had been looking forward to her first career meeting with Osaka, said she didn’t know what the spectator said, she just knew her opponent was upset.,“I didn’t hear what the lady say because I really was so focused on my game, on my serve game, I didn’t understand what she say.,“But after that moment, I saw that Naomi, she start to cry. I don’t understand what’s happen.”,With Osaka’s defeat the women’s field in the prestigious WTA and ATP Masters hard court tournament lost another big name.,Aryna Sabalenka, at No. 3 the highest-ranked woman in the field, crashed out of her opening match as Italian Jasmine Paolini rallied for a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 triumph.,Sabalenka was seeded second in a tournament missing both world No. 1 Ash Barty and second-ranked Barbora Krejcikova.,Both were late withdrawals, Barty saying she hadn’t had time to prepare after her Australian Open triumph and Krejcikova with an elbow injury.,Sabalenka got off to a strong start against the 46th-ranked Italian, but Paolini was able to capitalize on her struggles on serve that included 10 double faults.,Paolini admitted that after dropping the first set by a large margin, victory was the last thing on her mind.,“I mean, the score was 6-2 for her,” she said. “I wasn’t even close to her.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez scored two goals each as Manchester City restored its lead at the top of the Premier League to six points with a convincing 4-1 derby victory over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.,United put up a decent fight in the first half, going down just 2-1, but City’s quality showed after the interval with Ralf Rangnick’s side looking increasingly demoralized.,
,City has 69 points from 28 games with Liverpool on 63 with a game in hand. United sliped down to fifth place, a point behind Arsenal which beat Watford on Sunday and have three games in hand.,Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said his team’s display it remains as hungry as ever for success despite already having trophy-filled seasons under the Spanish coach.,“I said many times the biggest form of success for a manager is that after winning three Premier Leagues in the last four years we still run like we run and we are still there to win again,” he said.,“You can get confused and think like maybe you are what you are not. Still we are humble enough to do it again and again and be up there. After these guys have been there many years,” he added.,De Bruyne was outstanding, running the game from central midfield and then presenting himself as a threat in the box.,United was without Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani due to injuries and Rangnick surprisingy opted to play Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes in forward positions.,City made the perfect start with De Bruyne putting his club ahead in the fifth minute by slotting home a low pulled-back pass from Bernardo Silva after they overloaded the left side.,United drew level through a superb curling shot from Jadon Sancho, who took his time and cut inside after a swift break before beating Ederson with his confident strike.,De Bruyne later restored City’s advantage, finding the target after Phil Foden powered into the area and saw his shot parried out by David De Gea.,City dominated after the break and made it 3-1 when De Bruyne struck a corner deep to the edge of the box and Mahrez met it with a first-time drive that took a slight deflection off Harry Maguire.,Mahrez completed the victory with a goal that was initially flagged as offside. VAR, however, found Alex Telles had played the Algerian onside before he latched on to an Ilkay Gundogan pass and blasted in off De Gea’s story.,“It was excellent from the first minute,” Guardiola said. “We played really well and had to be patient in the first step.”,“Football is emotions. It’s tactics, definitely, but it’s also emotions. Without the ball, we are a team with desire and passion to regain the ball from the first minute to the 90th,” he added.,Rangnick felt his tactics had been the right way to take on City before the gulf in class became evident.,“It was working,” he said. “For us it was clear if we want a chance to win the game we have to do a lot of running. You have to be in attacking and hunting mode and we did that in the first half. The third goal killed us off in the end.”,“It’s difficult, if we attack them very high there is a lot of negative running you need to do. The third goal is a brilliantly taken corner and it is almost impossible to defend that. The second half they were the better team and they showed the quality they have. We struggled especially after they scored the third one.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Real Madrid pulled off one of the great Champions League comebacks on Wednesday, as Karim Benzema scored a breathtaking hat trick to upstage Kylian Mbappe and eliminate Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.,Madrid was set to be the latest victim of another Mbappe masterclass, after the 23-year-old ran the Spanish giant ragged for the better part of an hour and scored to put PSG ahead 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate.,
,Madrid came storming back, however, as Benzema capitalized on a mistake by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and then scored an incredible double in two minutes, with the third coming within 11 seconds after PSG kicked off.,When the full-time whistle confirmed the 3-2 aggregate victory, many of Madrid’s players dropped to their knees and looked up to the sky, as much perhaps in disbelief as joy.,“Every game is a final now for us in the Champions League and La Liga but today we showed that Real Madrid is alive,” Benzema said.,Manchester City also reached the quarterfinals, sailing through after a scoreless draw against Sporting Lisbon in their last-16 second leg match. City progressed 5-0 on aggregate. Manchester City had already done the hard work in its thrashing of the Portuguese side in the first leg three weeks ago in Lisbon, and could take it easy against an inferior Sporting at Etihad Stadium.,For PSG, it was another epic collapse to add to a growing list of Champions League disappointments, with Mauricio Pochettino’s future as coach immediately cast into doubt.,Even with Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar, the Qatari-owned club’s wait for a Champions League crown goes on.,“We didn’t manage our emotions well. We left ourselves exposed,” Pochettino said. “We leave with great pain and disappointment because we didn’t score the goals to reflect our superiority over the two games.”,Pochettino also fumed at referee Danny Makkelie for not whistling for a foul as Benzema challenged Donnarumma before Madrid’s first goal.,“Explaining what happened is easy, there was a foul on Donnarumma during the first goal, and that changed everything,” he said.,All eyes were on Mbappe, the only player to be cheered by Madrid’s fans before the game as they were gifted an up-close preview of the player they hope will be theirs this summer.,Mbappe delivered, scoring a superb goal, not to mention a spellbinding second that was disallowed for offside.,But what looked set to become an exhibition of the world’s deadliest player instead became another remarkable European night for Real Madrid and another nightmare for PSG.,“We suffered a lot but we endured,” Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said. “Karim gave us the chance to score the first goal and then the magic came. From then on, there was only one team was on the field.”,Madrid clearly wanted to hit PSG hard from the start and for a while, it worked, with Vinicius Junior tearing down the left and Fede Valverde bulldozing through Mbappe.,But the surge was brief, with PSG killing Madrid’s momentum, pushing them back and taking complete control.,Mbappe sped clear for the first time in the eighth minute, with Neymar curling a ball into the space on the left. The stadium held its breath, Mbappe made room but this time hit Courtois.,PSG was comfortable, dictating the play and sensing the trepidation. Madrid had openings, Benzema curling just wide, but all over the pitch Real looked slower, heavier and more cumbersome.,Lionel Messi skipped through and scooped wide before Mbappe had his first of two goals ruled out, driving into the corner only to see the flag raised.,The opener, though, felt inevitable. Dani Carvajal lost the ball upfield and with Madrid committed, Neymar arced another brilliant pass over the top.,By the time he reached it, Mbappe only had David Alaba in front of him and as he set up to bend into the far corner, he instead fired early, whipping a deadly shot past Courtois and inside the near post.,Madrid tried to reset at halftime, but Mbappe picked up where he left off with a brilliant, but disallowed, goal.,He fooled Courtois with an astonishing dummy shot, beating the Belgian without even touching the ball and slammed in. The flag went up but the stadium was astounded.,The game was becoming less a contest, more an Mbappe exhibition before Benzema, out of nowhere, dragged Madrid back into the tie.,He chased Nuno Mendes’ backpass to Donnarumma, who skewed under pressure. Vinicius was able to collect and cut back to Benzema, who slotted home.,It was Luka Modric who inspired Madrid’s second, as his scintillating run through midfield allowed Vinicius to race clear down the left. He scooped back inside to Modric, whose exquisite reverse pass found Benzema, who finished.,Madrid was level on aggregate, as the goal was confirmed after a check from VAR. Then just seconds later, incredibly, they were ahead. PSG squandered possession from kick-off, Rodrygo released Vinicius and Marquinhos’ attempted clearance found Benzema, who steered into the corner.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has vowed the team will not be destroyed by the sanctions on Blues owner Roman Abramovich that plunged the European champions into turmoil before their 3-1 win at Norwich on Thursday.,Abramovich was one of seven more oligarchs slapped with new British restrictions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,
,The Russian billionaire’s UK assets have been frozen, with strict restrictions placed on Chelsea, who are currently not allowed to sign new players, renew contracts or sell match tickets.,Even Chelsea’s club shop has been closed, while their main shirt sponsor, mobile phone company Three, responded to the sanctions by saying it was temporarily suspending the £40 million ($52 million) deal.,The sanctions have raised fears for Chelsea’s survival, but Blues boss Tuchel insisted after the Premier League victory against Norwich that his team would not be throwing in the towel.,“So far we can trust each other and this will not change. As long as we have enough shirts and a bus to drive to the games we will be there and will compete hard,” he said.,“Everybody can be very sure that we focus on us, to keep the attitude and the mentality right on the training ground and within the team.”,
,Reports on Thursday claimed sportswear giant Nike, which makes Chelsea’s kit, was also considering ending the £900 million, 15-year deal it signed with the club in 2016.,Car manufacturer Hyundai said it is “currently assessing” its contract with the Blues.,Chelsea, no longer allowed to spend more than £20,000 on away travel, will continue to receive TV broadcast payments and prize money, but this is set to be frozen.,They have been given a special license to continue playing, but Chelsea officials were holding talks with the government on Thursday to discuss the scope of that arrangement.,Abramovich had already announced he was willing to sell Chelsea, with a host of potential buyers declaring their interest in a club which has won 19 major trophies since the Russian bought them in 2003.,Tuchel has no idea which direction the club will head once Abramovich is gone, but he will not worry about problems he cannot control.,“I didn’t see that coming yesterday and I don’t know what is coming tomorrow,” Tuchel said.,“The level of impact it has, the news of today is big, in time we don’t know how big. We cannot influence it.”,There has been speculation Tuchel might quit Chelsea given their suddenly turbulent situation.,But the German, who has won the Champions League and Club World Cup since he was hired by Abramovich in January 2021, remains happy at the west London club.,“I am still happy to be here and still happy to be manager of a strong team,” he said.,Chelsea are third in the Premier League after easing past lowly Norwich to move nine points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United in the race for a top-four finish.,They are also still in contention in the Champions League last 16 and FA Cup quarter-finals.,Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen are all out of contract this summer and could be forgiven for letting the uncertainty affect their play.,Tuchel will use Chelsea’s top-four and trophy targets to keep his players focused amid the mayhem, but he conceded he was concerned they might be distracted before the Norwich game.,“It would be a lie if I said we I had no doubts but I also had a lot of trust,” he said.,“In difficult circumstances we produced a lot of results and good performances so we can trust in our mentality and the culture in the club. We allowed ourselves to focus on the football.”,Mason Mount, one of Chelsea’s scorers at Norwich, added: “You can’t really avoid it as there’s a lot going on.,“We have to focus on what we do on the pitch.

,After a ball into the box flew high off the head of teammate Anderson Lopes, the 33-year-old Saneto connected with the acrobatic bicycle kick that hit the bottom of the crossbar and landed over the goal line.,The result left Mihailo Petrovic’s squad still searching for their first win of the campaign, with draws in all four J1 matches this season.,Suga gave the hosts the lead in the 70th minute when he fired a tightly angled shot across Marinos keeper Yohei Takaoka and into the net off the inside of the far post.,Kevin Muscat’s men created the better of the first-half chances, with midfielder Joel Chima Fujita hitting the post early and Sapporo keeper Takanori Sugeno stopping attempts from Lopes and fellow Brazilian attacker Elber.,“I think we (missed) a number of chances, particularly in the first half,” former Australia defender Muscat said. “But in the end, we got an equalizer in the last second … so no complaints.”,Two-time defending champions Kawasaki Frontale are top with 13 points, two ahead of Yokohama, after Marcinho’s 25th-minute winner was enough to see off Nagoya Grampus 1-0 at home.,In other J1 action, Cerezo Osaka were 3-1 winners away to Shimizu S-Pulse, while Jubilo Iwata drew 1-1 at home to Gamba Osaka after Leandro Pereira netted the visitors’ 88th-minute equalizer.,FC Tokyo overcame Sanfrecce Hiroshima 2-1 at home, Kashiwa Reysol beat visiting Avispa Fukuoka 1-0, and Kyoto Sanga secured a 1-1 draw away to Shonan Bellmare after being reduced to 10 men for the second straight game.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing Writer,Is the spring sumo tournament in danger of being canceled?,The question has suddenly arisen as Japan’s national sport struggles to deal with a wave of infections that has already resulted in two of sumo’s most significant one-day meets being called off in the past week.,
,The 46th edition of the Fuji TV-backed Japan Grand Sumo Tournament and the 54th running of NHK’s Charity Grand Sumo, scheduled for Feb. 6 and 11 respectively, will not be taking place.,Holding the events became untenable when the omicron explosion in Japan reached sumo and resulted in a large number of high-profile wrestlers, including , Terunofuji and January tournament winner Mitakeumi, testing positive for the virus.,Daily coronavirus cases nationwide had dropped ,, but have skyrocketed in early February — ,.,Vaccinations have of course reduced both COVID-19’s lethality and severity, resulting in a smaller percentage of people requiring hospitalization, but the sheer number of cases nationwide caused by the rapidly spreading omicron variant has counterbalanced that improvement somewhat.,Provisional figures indicate Tuesday had the second highest daily COVID-19-related death toll to date — 159 — since the pandemic began.,With quasi-emergency declarations being extended in many prefectures, fans in Osaka missing out on live sumo for a third straight year has to be considered a possibility,
,
,However, even with the challenges omicron has brought, an outright cancellation of the upcoming spring tournament seems improbable.,Barring another mass outbreak just before the March meet gets under way, the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) is unlikely to scrap a tournament while most wrestlers are healthy and able to compete.,Similarly, moving the entire JSA organization to Osaka only to hold a , behind closed doors, like what happened in 2020, doesn’t make much sense from a logistical or financial point of view.,Keeping everyone in the Tokyo area and hosting the spring tournament at the Kokugikan though must be in the cards.,Such a move would both avoid the possibility of falling victim to various local restrictions on sporting events crossing prefectural borders — as happened recently with one American football league — and afford the JSA maximum flexibility in terms of ticket sales if the situation improved mid-basho.,While the Osaka meet is scheduled to get under way on March 13, having to transport equipment, food and clothing across the country requires an early move west.,Without permanent bases in Kansai — or sumo’s other regional venues — temporary lodgings not owned by stables are used when sumo leaves the capital.,Temples and shrines are common hosts, but most don’t have existing practice rings and so wrestlers normally need to spend their first few days in Osaka each year building their own rings and training facilities,To ensure adequate preparation time, sumo stables generally pack up and move to the Kansai area during the last week of February, meaning a decision on whether or not to proceed with the meet in Osaka needs to be made soon.,If the JSA decides to stay in Tokyo, hold a spectatorless meet or cancel the spring tournament entirely it will be a bitter blow to fans in sumo’s birthplace.,The last time a tournament took place in Osaka in front of fans, Hakuho and Kakuryu were the active yokozuna, while Takayasu, Goeido and Tochinoshin occupied the , ranks.,Only two of those men are still competing and both of their positions in the top division seem increasingly less secure.,Sumo has witnessed the greatest wrestler in the history of the sport call it a day and a new power rise during its three-year long hiatus from Osaka’s supporters.,For the sake of those in that region and the health of the sport in general, it is vital that sumo returns to Kansai as soon as possible.,
,
,If the upcoming meet is canceled or moved, some will point fingers at the JSA and say the organization could have done more to prevent the current outbreak from being so widespread.,Public relations department head Shibatayama’s comment — in relation to Terunofuji’s recent bout against Mitakeumi a day before the latter tested positive — saying that just doing sumo doesn’t necessarily make someone a close contact raised many eyebrows.,That reaction turned to outright annoyance online when the yokozuna — and numerous others that had participated in the same retirement ceremony — subsequently were found to be infected.,With the speed at which omicron spreads rendering previous COVID-19 countermeasures insufficient worldwide however, it’s unclear if the JSA could realistically have prevented the outbreak — especially given that it has followed all official government guidelines and even added extra restrictions of its own since the pandemic began.,It can also be hard to know exactly what the correct approach to dealing with COVID-19 in a sporting context is at this stage. The contrast between The Japan Times staff writer Dan Orlowitz reporting on full-body , while stadiums are full of maskless fans in Europe and the U.S. is stark, and it shows that politics, culture and simple weariness after two years of restrictions all play a part in these decisions.,The middle ground path taken in Japan, with no lockdowns and a heavy reliance on people wearing masks, following guidelines and getting vaccinated, has been relatively successful and allowed sumo to hold tournaments at three of the sport’s four regular venues since the pandemic started.,The exception to that success is Osaka, being the only location where fans have missed out completely since COVID-19 began.,Everyone in sumo is hoping that’s a situation that will be remedied next month.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,It’s always darkest just before the dawn.,That’s an old cliche, but one that has become relevant again as omicron’s massive infection waves are increasingly being seen around the world as heralding the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.,
,A combination of factors — ranging from high vaccination rates to the aforementioned variant’s seemingly less-lethal impact and simple fatigue with bad news — have resulted in numerous countries removing some, if not all, of the coronavirus-related restrictions that had been in place over the past two years.,Following the death of singer Meat Loaf in January, Irish writer Colm Tobin went viral with a tweet suggesting that “,,” despite infection numbers in that country still being higher than at any point prior to December 2021.,Tweets like that don’t go viral if people think COVID-19 is still raging.,With Japan in the middle of its biggest wave to date, and many prefectures under quasi-emergency measures, similarly glib tweets referring to the pandemic in the past tense still seem a long way away here — even with infection numbers declining slightly over the past few days.,Even so, there are signs this year will see a return to a sporting landscape closer to normal than it has been at any time since early 2020.,There may not be the complete and rapid abandonment of restrictions seen internationally, but for sport in general and sumo in particular the coming year figures to be significantly different — and much improved.,While the Japan Sumo Association has managed to hold all but one of its scheduled tournaments since COVID-19 first arrived on these shores, the unique way in which the organization operates has resulted in it taking a far greater hit in one key area.,Sumo has always relied heavily on close-and-personal contact with its supporters to ensure solid finances, healthy recruitment numbers and the long-term viability of the sport.,While foreign media outlets often describe sumo as a “secretive” “hidden world” in their reporting, the reality is that sumo arguably offers far greater accessibility for fans than any other major sport.,That is something which is immediately apparent to every first-time visitor to a tournament.,All wrestlers, bar those at the highest ranks of , and ,, enter and exit through the same gates as the general public, making their way to the dressing room through throngs of fans.,The idea of NFL players carrying their pads through the concourse at the Super Bowl, or stars like Lebron James or Lionel Messi having to queue up with ticket holders at concession stands would be inconceivable, but the equivalent situation is a common sight in sumo.,In pre-pandemic times, , making their way back to stables after their bouts also lingered in the hallways chatting to friends and family, as well as posing for photos or signing autographs.,Outside of official tournaments, access was even greater.,
,
,Visiting a sumo stable to watch training has long been possible for anyone simply willing to get up early in the morning and make their way to Tokyo’s Ryogoku district, and is something with few if any equivalents in other major sports.,While ringside seats at tournaments cost ¥14,300 ($124) and are as rare as gold dust, in pre-pandemic times it was still possible for the general public to simply drop by a stable most mornings, watch the best athletes in the sport train for a few hours and then chat with them afterwards at no cost.,Supporters were regularly invited to eat lunch with the wrestlers after practice as well, and chowing down on healthy and delicious , meals while sitting mere feet away from the training ring is something that many sumo fans have experienced.,Of course, that required living in, or at least traveling to, Tokyo or one of the three regional venues — all major urban areas — that host tournaments.,Those in further flung regions weren’t left out, however.,Regional tours, known as ,, brought sumo to those living far from the capital.,Countless small towns and remote municipalities have played host to sumo throughout the decades on the sport’s regular treks around the country between tournaments.,Those provided an opportunity for schoolchildren, the elderly and others unable to travel to experience the sport up close and in person.,Of course, the JSA also got something in return. Regional events helped the organization’s finances and served as promotional and recruitment tools — though less so recently than in times gone by.,In recent years, the fan service aspect has arguably been one the biggest reasons sumo continued putting so much effort into its jungyō tours.,Other sports may also have meet-and-greet events, but they aren’t an intrinsic part of those sports’ fabrics in the way they are in sumo.,Being prevented from holding jungyō and having to restrict entry to stables has hindered sumo from maintaining its traditionally close relationship with fans over the past two years.,As exciting as the action has been in the ring during the pandemic, the sport has been something missing a key part of what makes it special and unique.,Sumo needs the human touch that only comes from direct interaction.,Plans are in place for a return to touring, but exactly when that will take place isn’t clear.,For the sake of the sport, the sooner the better.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,The ascension of veteran Mitakeumi to the rank of ,and Abi to ,in Monday’s latest Japan Sumo Association rankings put the spotlight on the two wrestlers’ perseverance.,Mitakeumi, a hot prospect out of university, rose rapidly to the three ,ranks below ,, but needed 28 tournaments as a ,or sekiwake before his third grand tournament championship in January put him over the top and earned him promotion to ozeki.,
,Abi, meanwhile, had one foot out of the sumo world in August 2020, when he offered to resign after it was revealed he repeatedly violated coronavirus protocols the previous month. Instead, he served a three-tournament suspension that forced him to restart his career from the third-tier ,division.,Mitakeumi’s 28 tourneys as a sanyaku wrestler before ozeki promotion are fourth most in history and four short of the record 32 set by former ozeki Kaio in 2000. At 29 years and one month, Mitakeumi will be the sixth-oldest wrestler to make his debut at sumo’s second-highest rank.,He is also the first wrestler from Nagano Prefecture to achieve that rank since 1795.,Abi’s suspension lit the same fire under him that once saw him run off one solid tourney after another and propelled him to komusubi in July 2019. But after losing 10 ,-division bouts for the first time in January 2020, he began to slide, until he pulled out of the July tourney when his infractions became known.,In March 2021, he returned to action as a No. 56 makushita. Unbeaten in two seven-bout tourneys in that division, he earned re-promotion to the makuuchi division after going 24-6 in two campaigns as a second-tier ,wrestler.,And after back-to-back 12-win tourneys, Abi is back on track in a new look sanyaku class.,Abi, who made the huge jump from No. 6 maegashira to sekiwake, is joined at the sport’s third-highest rank by another newcomer, 27-year-old dynamo Wakatakakage, who went 9-6 as a No. 1 in January.,The komusubi rank is filled by Takanosho, who went 7-8 as a sekiwake last time, and Hoshoryu, the 22-year-old nephew of former Mongolian yokozuna Asashoryu.,Terunofuji remains at the top of the rankings. Sumo’s lone yokozuna’s surgically repaired knees troubled him in January, when he went 11-4 and saw his two-tourney win streak snapped by Mitakeumi.,The two incumbent ozeki, Shodai and Takakeisho, each failed to win eight bouts in January, making them ,ozeki who will need eight wins in March to avoid demotion to sekiwake.,At the other end of sumo’s top division, Kotokuzan will be making his makuuchi debut as a No. 16 maegashira after going 10-5 as a No. 4 juryo in January, and will be joined by three veterans earning re-promotion, No. 14 Kotoshoho, No. 16 Nishikigi, and No. 17 Kagayaki.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing Writer,Fallout from the invasion of Ukraine reached the sporting world this week, with numerous international governing bodies, including FIFA and World Rugby, imposing suspensions on Russian athletes and teams.,In amateur sumo, repercussions from the conflict between the two countries have long been felt, with 2008 Ukrainian world heavyweight champion Olga Davydko switching allegiance to Russia following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.,
,Davydko won a second world title in 2018, and such has been her new team’s dominance over the past 15 years that the World Games’ decision to bar Russian athletes from this summer’s competition in Alabama has, out of all the sports at the 2022 games, had the greatest impact on sumo.,Fittingly, Ukraine figures to be the biggest beneficiary of Russia’s suspension and should now dominate the women’s tournament while significantly increasing its podium finishes in the men’s competition.,One woman saved from potentially having to play the role of peacemaker between the warring eastern European nations is Katrina Watts.,The Russian-speaking Australian polyglot is arguably the most recognizable figure in global amateur sumo, and someone the International Sumo Federation (IFS) has long relied on to ensure the smooth running of its international meets.,Watts has been a prominent figure in the sport for over 30 years and since the 1990s has been a mainstay at World Championships, where she undertakes numerous roles including stadium announcer, translator, IFS official and general problem-solver.,
,
,Unlike most non-Japanese in amateur sumo though, Watts’ road into the sport came through the professional game.,As with many foreign nationals in pre-internet era Japan, she first encountered sumo on television while waiting for the English-language world news segment, and later got hooked when attending a live tournament.,A keen photographer, Watts had begun taking pictures of sumo when, during a regional tour event, she noticed one , having his topknot styled as another sat alongside playing with a Gameboy. “I thought, ‘Oh that’s such an interesting shot — the traditional and the modern.’”,Her pictures eventually drew the attention of young rikishi, who she discovered all wanted photos of themselves.,One connection led to another, and Watts soon became close with many of the sport’s higher-ranked rikishi and officials.,“I didn’t need the casting couch” she laughs, recalling the time she was quizzed by a well-known sumo journalist about how she had gotten so deep into the sport. “I worked my way into sumo with celluloid — and later my baking skills.”,Watts progressed from friend and photographer to a more formal involvement, and when the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) traveled to the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, they brought the Sydney native along.,In London, she took rikishi and officials shopping and sightseeing, while continuing to photograph proceedings. One photo she took of Kyokudozan with a Beefeater made the back cover of a sumo magazine.,It was a career path that only came about by chance.,“In Australia I was working in high school teaching English and modern languages. I had done two years of Japanese at university, and I introduced it at the school, but the gap between my knowledge of Japanese and that of the students was dwindling, so I took the opportunity to go to Japan — ostensibly just for two years — but after six months I wrote saying, ‘Not coming back.’”,
,
,Watts’ involvement in the foreign tours continued and deepened following the 1991 trip. She accompanied the JSA to France, was the stadium announcer in Canada and helped Akebono make a farewell speech in German in Austria.,When sumo visited her hometown of Sydney, Watts battled with the JSA board to allow , Akebono to end his farewell address with “goodbye Aussies,” which they felt was too informal. She got her way though and was vindicated when it was met with a rousing ovation from the crowd.,One of her more interesting translating jobs came while working with the JSA in Canada. “A radio station from Quebec wanted to interview Musashimaru but they didn’t want him to speak in English.” That resulted in the Hawaii-raised yokozuna using Japanese with Watts and she in turn translating what he said into French.,Despite teaching at Kobe Shoin Women’s University for the entire duration of her 25 year stay in Japan, Watts also found time to work on both the Japanese- and English-language broadcasts for NHK and contribute to various publications.,Her extensive contacts and knowledge of the sport meant it was no surprise when the International Sumo Federation tapped her to help when the World Championship was to be first held outside Japan.,Describing the 1999 tournament in Germany as a “shambles,” Watts recalls how the lack of organization led to the women’s event not having enough countries to be considered a world championship.,“They did all sorts of terrible things. They wanted ring girls in skimpy silky things, they wanted taiko drumming all the way through, and in the program they had (an unauthorized) photo of Konishiki advertising an insurance company.”,

			,Contributing writer,Hidetora Hanada, 2020’s amateur yokozuna, made headlines again this week — but not for his exploits inside the sumo ring.,The second-year Nippon Sport Science University student took part in open tryouts for the X League, Japan’s premier American football competition, in Kawasaki on March 6.,
,Despite a complete lack of experience on the gridiron, and needing to buy a helmet and pads just for the combine-style event, Hanada was the star of the show at Fujitsu Stadium.,The tryouts were streamed live, and in offensive line drills the sumo wrestler could be seen dominating opponents that had been playing football for years.,While official results weren’t released, longtime football commentator Hiroaki Shishido reported the former All-Japan champion delivered a 40-yard dash time of 5.23 seconds — an impressive performance for a newcomer working out in front of scouts for the first time.,The Wakayama native’s performance drew audible gasps from coaches in the stands and his outing dominated both newspaper headlines and social media feeds related to the event.,Hanada’s switch of sports didn’t come out of the blue, however.,In a pre-tryout interview on the event’s official website, the NSSU student said he had been watching American football and incorporating elements of its training into his workouts since elementary school.,
,
,Hanada’s favorite NFL player is Aaron Donald — and with a height of 185 cm and weighing in at 135 kg, the gridiron rookie has almost identical measurements to the Los Angeles Rams superstar.,Using the phrase ,, which translates literally as “wielding dual swords” and is often used to describe athletes like Shohei Otani who are adept at two diverse skills, Hanada stated his desire to become both an NFL player and a , in professional sumo.,If he realizes the first dream, he’ll be the first athlete to do so from these shores.,While several Japanese players have made offseason NFL rosters in the past several years and even taken part in preseason action, none to date have survived final cuts or played in a regular-season game.,Hanada turned to one of those who has come closest when preparing for his X League tryout.,Takashi Kurihara, who has spent time in camp with the Baltimore Ravens, helped Hanada refine his sprint technique in the weeks leading up to last weekend’s event.,The impressive results achieved in a limited time means the two will almost certainly work together again if Hanada switches sports. That’s something he now realizes he’ll have to do to have any hope of making the NFL.,Speaking to reporters after the March 6 workout, Hanada revealed he has changed his original plan and decided that it would be better to try and forge a career in football first before taking up sumo later.,
,
,“The life of an NFL player is short and it’s absolutely better to do when younger,” Hanada said. “Wakanohana tried to take up American football after becoming a yokozuna and he said it’s not a sport you can do when older. Terunofuji became yokozuna at 29 so it wouldn’t be too late for me either.”,Even with youth and athletic prowess on his side, making the NFL is a long shot for Hanada.,Competition is fierce in America’s biggest sport and there are far more NFL-level players with top-tier college experience than there are spots available on rosters.,The closest any sumo wrestler has come to professional football remains former , Wakanoho’s brief stint with the University of South Florida’s Division I program.,Six Japanese X League players were drafted into the Canadian Football League last season, however, and that league has a global program that makes Canada a more realistic long-term destination for Hanada.,Even if he doesn’t make it in professional football overseas, Hanada can still experience gridiron at a high level domestically.,Though not widely known, Japan is by far the most dominant power in the global American football scene outside of the United States and Canada.,In the five world championships held to date, only Japan (twice) and the United States (three times) have taken home gold.,At the senior club and international levels, no Japanese team has ever lost a game to a side from outside the U.S. or Canada since football first arrived on these shores in 1934.,The X League is also stacked with Americans that have NFL, CFL and NCAA experience, and Tokyo Dome hosts a championship game that attracts up to 35,000 people each January.,If Hanada were to become yokozuna and then join the X League, he’d be the third grand champion to do so.,The aforementioned Wakanohana spent time at Onward Skylarks after hanging up his , belt, while Wajima was both player and team official at Gakusei-Engokai Rocbull.,Links between the two sports remain strong and in recent years former yokozuna Kisenosato has even been part of the NHK commentary team for the Rice Bowl.,
,
,If Hanada does play football domestically, the nine-time champion Obic Seagulls are the most likely destination.,The Chiba-based outfit was the only team he mentioned playing for in post-workout interviews, and sources inside the organization have indicated there has already been contact between the two sides.,At Obic, Hanada would have a chance to play alongside arguably the greatest football player Japan has ever produced. Wide receiver Noriaki Kinoshita won multiple championships at Ritsumeikan University and was a star in NFL Europe.,Kinoshita helped Amsterdam Admirals to consecutive World Bowl titles in 2005 and 2006 before impressing in time spent with Atlanta Falcons.,If Hanada sticks with football he could have an opportunity to become one of the few homegrown players able to earn a professional contract domestically.,The 20-year-old is star material, and his talent and ability to grab the headlines would be invaluable to a league that often struggles to market itself despite having a high quality product.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing Writer,Manchester United’s “Theatre of Dreams” and the Green Bay Packers’ “Titletown” are two world famous location-based sporting monikers that have been widely derided over the past decade for failing to live up their outlandish descriptions.,Neither, however, comes close to the complete fabrication that the Osaka Spring Basho’s widely used “Stormy ,” nickname has become.,
,Once renowned as the site of upset victories and unpredictable outcomes, the spring meet honor roll has long since turned into merely a list of the sport’s biggest names.,Terunofuji’s title win a year ago, while ranked at ,, made him the first non-, or , to lift the Emperor’s Cup at the March tournament in 21 years, but even in that case, promotion to the latter rank occurred just three days later.,That meet also took place in Tokyo, as COVID-imposed restrictions prevented the Japan Sumo Association from traveling to its normal spring destination. That means the last man outside of sumo’s top two ranks to win the tournament in Osaka remains Takatoriki, who lifted the only Emperor’s Cup of his career in March 2000.,Those looking for historical symmetry are doubtless disappointed by the nightmare finish endured by Takatoriki’s son, Oho, in his top division debut earlier this year.,After a promising start that left him on the cusp of a winning record, newly promoted Oho dropped his final five bouts to end the January meet with seven wins and eight losses.,The 21-year-old was subsequently demoted to the second tier and will miss out on a chance to become the first , ranked title winner in Osaka since his father two decades ago.,Terunofuji, meanwhile, added three more championships over the eight months following his victory last March, and he now returns to sumo’s birthplace a dominant yokozuna seeking to extend Osaka’s wait for a genuine surprise winner.,Whether or not the massive Mongolian will achieve that feat is hard to predict however, as a wave of coronavirus infections hit sumo’s top ranks in early February, and it’s still unclear what condition many if not most of the main title contenders are in.,Kansai may well regain its stormy reputation and see a truly unexpected outcome in 2022, but not for the reason anyone in the sport had wanted.,
,
,COVID-19’s effects are disparate, unpredictable and often lingering, so it won’t be until the action finally gets underway at Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium on Sunday that we have a clear idea about exactly who is in fighting condition.,For now, barring withdrawals, it seems that three men are set to dominate the headlines over the next two weeks.,
,An incredible run of title wins, and runner-up finishes that saw Terunofuji rise from the rank of maegashira to yokozuna in just over a year, finally came to a halt in January.,A late tournament injury prevented the veteran from achieving a historic championship three-peat following promotion to grand champion. But even while clearly out of sorts, Terunofuji took matters down to the final bout of that meet.,If healthy, and that’s a big if, the Ulaanbaatar native is still far and away the best wrestler currently active in sumo.,Even if not at 100% Terunofuji has to be considered the title favorite based on what he has achieved over the past year.,The yokozuna has been pictured training at his stable working out with other , level wrestlers, but precious little video of the sessions has been released, so gauging his stamina levels or how much he is protecting his knees isn’t possible.,With the recent coronavirus outbreak also hampering open practice sessions between top-rankers that have been a feature of recent years, there is also no way to judge Terunofuji’s current level against that of the men who figure be his main title rivals in Osaka.,There have of course been video conference-calls with the media by many high-profile wrestlers since the last tournament ended, but as is the case in every sport, actual insight about health and physical condition that could give a competitive advantage to opponents if made public isn’t on any athlete’s agenda.,
,Sumo’s most recent ozeki is also the ,With a third Emperor’s Cup under his belt and promotion to the sport’s second highest rank achieved, it would appear Mitakeumi has managed to extract maximum value from his undoubted sumo abilities.,Even the Nagano native’s more ardent supporters have long recognized that achieving the ultimate honor of yokozuna promotion requires a kind of consistency that Mitakeumi has never come close to displaying.,
,
,An 11-4 outing in November followed by a 13-2 title run in January is the best back-to-back tournament performance in Mitakeumi’s career to date.,While a 13-2 record is probably good enough to put a , in the title hunt in most tournaments, it’s still on the lower end of the scale when it comes to assessing what should be considered a title “equivalent” performance for yokozuna promotion.,If the Dewanoumi stable man hopes to take advantage of sumo’s current weakened state and make a run for the white rope, he’ll need to kick on and elevate his sumo to a level and consistency previously unseen.,Additional Emperor’s Cups aren’t out of the question, and Mitakeumi could even emerge victorious again in Osaka. That would be a surprise, however, and the smart money is probably on more up and down performances from the 29-year-old.,
,Regardless of whether or not you buy the narrative of Abi’s redemption and turn away from the dark side, there is no questioning the impact he has had on the top division since returning from a JSA imposed suspension for breaking COVID-19 protocols.,Back-to-back 12-3 runner-up performances that included wins over both Terunofuji and ozeki Takakeisho injected excitement into proceedings and have earned the Shikoroyama stable man promotion to sumo’s third highest rank of sekiwake for the first time.,But his new position will mean a much tougher slate of matches straight out of the gate and should quickly show whether or not Abi has what it takes to survive and thrive at the sharp end of the ,.,At 27, the Saitama native is at the age when many sumo wrestlers reach their peak. With the top two rikishi in the sport bedeviled by injury, and the next generation of rising stars not quite there yet, Abi has a window in which to create a storybook final act for a career that he seemed to have thrown away just two years ago.,
,Outside of the three rikishi discussed above, Takakeisho still bears watching the most.,The ozeki is , for March, which means that unless he manages eight wins, he’ll lose that rank for the second time since getting promoted in 2019.,Like Terunofuji, health is the determining factor for Takakeisho’s place in the pecking order. If fully fit, he is behind only the yokozuna when it comes to title favorites.,
,
,The 25-year-old’s pushing-thrusting style of sumo means that we’ll know within the first couple of days what shape he is in. When firing on all cylinders, Takakeisho overwhelms virtually all opponents, but when out of sorts, he struggles against even lower-level wrestlers.,In terms of a first surprise title winner in Osaka since Takatoriki, most people will be looking to fast-rising Hoshoryu to mount a challenge.,The 22-year-old Mongolian is an exciting prospect, and his famous yokozuna uncle (Asashoryu) ensures plenty of column inches, headlines and guest spots on variety shows.,Hoshoryu has a bright future ahead of him, but it may well be a veteran like , Takanosho that grabs the glory in Osaka this time out.,For good or bad, illness and injury have made the upcoming tournament arguably the hardest to predict in years, and there are arguments to be made for at least half a dozen other rikishi being in position to lift silverware at the end of the fortnight’s action.,One major positive, however, is the fact that not only will sumo return to Osaka for the first time since 2020, but fans will be allowed in to watch the action in person. That’s something that ,Starved of sumo for so long, it’s unlikely fans in Kansai will care whether we see dominance by the yokozuna as usual or a reclaiming of the basho’s stormy reputation.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Lone , Terunofuji easily took care of business against rising talent Hoshoryu at the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday, while Mitakeumi made a winning start to his , career., Hoshoryu was making his debut among the three , ranks below yokozuna on the opening day of the 15-day meet at Edion Arena Osaka, where spectators are witnessing the action for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.,
,Having lost all three of their previous meetings, the 22-year-old nephew of Mongolian great Asashoryu once again failed to find a winning formula against Terunofuji, who gained a grip at the jump and immediately forced him out.,The 30-year-old grand champion, who fell short in his bid for a third straight title at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, will fight No. 1 , Daieisho on Day 2.,Three-time grand tournament winner Mitakeumi, who lifted the Emperor’s Cup in January, debuted at sumo’s second-highest rank against towering Mongolian-born No. 2 Ichinojo.,The new ozeki stayed composed after being driven back by his 190-centimeter, 206-kilogram opponent, keeping his distance until seizing an opening to push Ichinojo over the straw bales.,Ozeki Takakeisho showed no sign of the right ankle injury that forced him out of the New Year meet, exploding out of the blocks in a pushout victory over wily No. 1 Ura.,Fighting as a demotion-threatened , ozeki, Takakeisho blasted through Ura’s defense to earn the first of the eight wins he needs to keep his rank.,Fellow kadoban ozeki Shodai looked anything but convincing, however, offering little resistance in a pushout loss to No. 1 Daieisho. Former , Daieisho flew off the mark and quickly bundled the hapless ozeki out.,“I think the fans in Osaka here are making the tournament exciting,” Daieisho said. “There are a lot of new faces at the top of the rankings, and that’s motivating me as well.”,Fighting at a career-high ranking of sekiwake after challenging for the title in January, Abi was pushed out by fellow former komusubi and current No. 3 Onosho.,Unable to budge Onosho with his trademark thrusting attack, Abi left himself open to the pushout when he unsuccessfully tried to pull his opponent off balance.,The 27-year-old Abi has surged up the rankings since returning from a half-year suspension for breaking sumo’s coronavirus safety rules in July 2020.,Wakatakakage, bumped up from No. 1 to sekiwake after going 9-6 in January, won his first bout at sumo’s third-highest rank against battle-hardened Mongolian No. 2 Tamawashi.,After absorbing a strong opening hit from Tamawashi, Wakatakakage showed quick reflexes in stepping to the side and thrusting the maegashira to the clay.,Komusubi Takanosho’s tournament got off to an anticlimactic start, gifting a win to No. 3 Meisei by losing his footing at the jump and slipping to the clay.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,After its premiere at north London’s Almeida Theatre in 2019, Robert Icke’s “The Doctor” earned glowing reviews and plaudits, most notably Olivier Award nominations for best new play and best actress. However, just as it was set to take on the West End, the production was shuttered by COVID closures.,Thankfully, in Tokyo, theaters have resumed business as usual after a grueling 18 months of multiple state of emergencies, and this latest work by Icke is running now through Nov. 28 at the Parco Theatre in Shibuya. Taking on the title role of Dr. Ruth Wolff, a Jewish physician, is actress Shinobu Otake, under the direction of seasoned veteran Tamiya Kuriyama.,
,“I had a chance to see the play at the Almeida, and although I couldn’t understand everything, I was able to grasp the characters’ relationships and the story,” Otake, 64, says. “I especially enjoyed the characters’ arguments, which had a brilliant rhythm and tempo. I was also greatly impressed by the main actress Juliet Stevenson. Her acting was truly realistic, and she was so energetic and cool.”,Otake, an acting veteran with three Japan Academy Film Awards under her belt, says that while she was enthusiastically applauding the show from the front row of the cozy theater, it never occurred to her that she would be performing the lead role in Japan a couple of years later.,For “The Doctor,” Icke freely adapted Viennese author Arthur Schnitzler’s 1912 play “Professor Bernhardi,” setting the story in the modern age with a female protagonist. Ruth is the founding director of a prestigious institute specializing in Alzheimer’s disease, and one day, a 14-year-old girl comes to her needing emergency care after a self-administered abortion. When the patient’s condition becomes dire, Ruth refuses to allow a Catholic priest (Toru Masuoka) to perform last rites, on the basis that they’re unsure of the young girl’s religious beliefs and that she should be allowed to die in peace.,Soon the priest’s side of the incident goes viral on social media, putting Ruth at the center of a scandal that reveals the contending values and sexist and racist attitudes of those around her as well as the general public.,Otake says she was surprised when she read the play in preparation for the Japanese production, as the story touches upon multiple weighty topics, such as gender, religion, degenerative disease and medical ethics.,“I understand that Ruth is an intelligent, strong and independent woman, but she definitely has a weakness that doesn’t usually show at her workplace,” she says. ”It’s normal to have different versions of yourself, and I realized anew that people shouldn’t be quick to judge others because they usually have several different personalities within them at the same time.,
,
,“I suppose Ruth has confidence in herself to always make the right decision. However, even though she doesn’t intend to, she hurts people without noticing. I think that those kinds of human contradictions, namely, that people are not able to be perfect 100% of the time, is one of the very interesting points of this play.”,Although the play takes place in England and discusses issues related to race and religion that may be less familiar to Japanese audiences, Otake insists that contemporary theater provides an important opportunity for viewers to become aware of other countries’ values, lifestyles and current affairs.,“Many people in Japan today live without experiencing conflicts over religion and race,” she says. “However, through our staging of this English drama, which intricately weaves in sensitive issues such as Jewish-Christian relations, I hope audiences realize what is happening outside Japan and see how the issues of other countries are relevant to them.,“That’s why it is important to stage non-Japanese dramas, and why I want many young people to see this play.”,Otake says the key to the English production’s success was that it is grounded in reality. When she saw the play in London, she felt as though the actors were having real debates in front of her eyes. So how will she and the rest of the cast create such a realistic experience here?,“When I act as Ruth during rehearsals, I become sensitive to how the other characters react. Though someone may try to hide their real intentions, they can’t do it well instantly. So, even during the quick and aggressive conversations, I carefully observe the other person’s first and most honest reactions.,“These are the very delicate and detailed things that actors need to worry about. So I carefully pay attention to each word. Which particular word do I need to react to or be angry about? I must make that point as clear as possible to tell this story.”,In the final scene, after she has been put through the wringer, Ruth meets the priest again. He speaks to her calmly, saying, “It’s difficult to hear each other over all the history crashing around us like waves.” Ruth responds, “I feel things are ending. The postwar institutions, the postwar ideals…. (They’re) starting to crack.”,To Otake, Ruth’s words are dark but true. Although modern society is changing, it’s not necessarily for the better. “On the other hand, I believe we should find hope during dark times,” she says, referring to how the pandemic revealed society’s need for change. “Always having hope for the future, that may be our salvation.”,The best way for audiences to understand this sentiment, Otake says, is by coming to the theater and seeing the live performance.,“During the pandemic, many theaters had to move their productions online. But I want to say in a loud voice that theater must be a live performance. … ‘The Doctor’ is a very thrilling conversational drama and you may laugh at seeing humans’ twisted ways of thinking.,“I hope many people will enjoy our verbal machine-gun battle as I experienced it in London.”,“The Doctor” runs through Nov. 28 at the Parco Theater in Shibuya, Tokyo.

			,BLOOMBERG,Stephen Sondheim, whose quick-witted lyrics made Broadway audiences sit up and listen in the 1950s and whose cerebral, ground-breaking shows from “Company” in 1970 to “Merrily We Roll Along” more than a decade later thrust the American musical into the modern era, has died. He was 91.,His death was confirmed by Broadway publicist Rick Miramontez. Sondheim died in his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, the New York Times reported, citing his lawyer and friend F. Richard Pappas. Sondheim had a Thanksgiving dinner with friends the day before, the paper said. Pappas couldn’t be immediately reached in his office in Austin, Texas.,
,Coming of age between the post-World War II era dominated on Broadway by Rodgers and Hammerstein and the post-Vietnam British invasion epitomized by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sondheim created shows around urban sophisticates, a murderous barber and single-minded obsessives.,Broadway productions for which he was both composer and lyricist that won Tony awards for best musical included “Passion,” “Sweeney Todd,” and “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.” His “Sunday in the Park with George” won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.,A student of the composer Milton Babbitt and protege of the romantic lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, Sondheim wrote shows that shimmered — and sometimes shivered — in the crawlspace between sentiment and existentialism. He was, as one of his most famous lyrics put it, the quintessential “Broadway baby,” able to please an audience with rousing anthems and plangent ballads.,“One of the brightest lights of Broadway is dark tonight,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a tweet, calling Sondheim a “legend.”,He was also Broadway’s most fearless innovator, constantly staking out new musical territory, whether or not the audience could be cajoled into joining him on the journey.,Neither as popular as Rodgers and Hammerstein nor the Gershwins, and not a box-office sensation like his younger contemporary, Lloyd Webber, Sondheim nonetheless set the standard for contemporary American musicals.,“Send in the Clowns,” from 1973 Tony winner “A Little Night Music,” was arguably the only standard in his vast catalog of songs. Renditions by Judy Collins and Frank Sinatra became hits.,Others, from “The Ladies Who Lunch” (“Company”) to “I’m Still Here” (“Follies”) and “Move On” (“Sunday in the Park with George”) became mainstays of cabaret singers.,Singer Barbra Streisand, who had a Broadway album based on many of those songs, said she was grateful for the time Sondheim had to work on his music.,Sondheim also wrote songs for several films, including “Reds,” “Dick Tracy” and “The Birdcage.”,Trained as a composer, he earned his first Broadway billing as lyricist for 1957’s “West Side Story.” His far more experienced collaborators were Leonard Bernstein, who composed the music; Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book; and Jerome Robbins, who staged and choreographed the landmark show.,Two years later, he collaborated with composer Jule Styne on “Gypsy” and the result was another high point in the pantheon of Broadway musicals.,With “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” Sondheim finally got billing as both composer and lyricist. A giddy travesty of comedies by the Roman playwright Plautus that was also staged by Robbins, the hit starred Zero Mostel as a slave desperate for freedom and sex, not necessarily in that order.,But it was Sondheim’s decade-long partnership with producer-turned-director Hal Prince, beginning in 1970 with the musical comedy “Company,” that solidified his place in the first rank of Broadway visionaries.,Based on writer George Furth’s stories about a swinging single and the married couples in his life, “Company” lacked a conventional plot. Instead, it focused on the ambivalence of Bobby, the central character, as he observes the marital discord all around him.,Paradoxically, “Company” also first saw the critical divide between those who found Sondheim challenging and insightful and those who dismissed him as too intellectual for a general audience.,Still, he inspired a new generation of artists.,“Every so often someone comes along that fundamentally shifts an entire art form,” actor Hugh Jackman said. “Stephen Sondheim was one of those.”,Movie and Broadway star Idina Menzel said “we will spend our lives trying to make you proud,” while Broadway performer Lea Salonga said “we shall be singing your songs forever.”,Stephen Joshua Sondheim was born March 22, 1930, the son of Herbert Sondheim, a dress manufacturer, and his chief designer, the former Janet Fox. They lived on Manhattan’s Central Park West, until the parents divorced when he was 10.,As a youth, Sondheim became friendly with Jamie Hammerstein. In Jamie’s father, Oscar, he found a lifelong mentor. Oscar Hammerstein’s principles of lyric writing would later take on biblical significance for Sondheim even as he rebelled against the form that Hammerstein and his last great partner, composer Richard Rodgers, had themselves redefined for Broadway audiences.,Sondheim briefly attended the New York Military Academy in Cornwall, New York. At Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1950, he began studying music in earnest. Babbitt, who taught at Princeton University, later took him on as a private pupil even though he knew Sondheim wasn’t interested in becoming a “serious” composer.,Only Hal Prince was as important as Hammerstein in focusing Sondheim’s vision. Both were interested in offbeat subjects. But where Sondheim saw private little sagas, Prince saw major statements.,The sometimes fitful merging of those two intellects and approaches resulted in a new kind of “concept musical,” beginning with “Company” and extending through “Follies,” “A Little Night Music,” “Pacific Overtures,” “Sweeney Todd” and “Merrily We Roll Along.”,The commercial failure of 1981’s “Merrily We Roll Along” led to a split with Prince, who died in 2019. Sondheim’s next important collaborator was James Lapine, a young director and writer influenced by Jungian psychology and the influence of dreams.,Together they wrote “Sunday in the Park with George,” in which Sondheim acknowledged the isolation of the artistic process by telling the story of the French Pointillist painter Georges Seurat, and his muse, Marie.,They also collaborated on 1987’s “Into the Woods,” a freewheeling mash of fairy tales that became one of Sondheim’s biggest box-office successes.,“Side By Side By Sondheim” and “Putting It Together” were just two of the many shows built around Sondheim’s songs. Although he was always working on new material, Sondheim spent his last decades encouraging the growth of young artists, founding the Young Playwrights Festival.,His last new Broadway musical, also written with Lapine, was 1994’s “Passion,” based on the novel “Fosca” by I.U. Tarchetti and the subsequent Ettore Scola film, “Passione d’Amore.” The musical concerned a handsome military officer with whom a sickly woman falls all-consumingly in love.,For decades, Sondheim had stood accused of a certain aloofness and ambivalence toward love that derived from his solitariness, his homosexuality, his perfectionism and his literary conceits. “Passion” was an attempt to address that criticism.,But like so many of his shows, “Passion” left the critics, and the public, deeply divided. Despite winning the Tony, it struggled for a few months and closed without earning back its production costs.,Yet those who saw it will never forget it. That seemed to be Sondheim’s fate.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,After 15 years of entertaining audiences in Japan and abroad, the actors of Saitama Gold Theater will take the stage for the last time with “Mizu no Eki” (“The Water Station”) this month.,“I’ll miss it a lot and I’m sad that the troupe is ending, though I don’t see any alternative because we’ve all simply become much older,” says Mitsuyo Obuchi, 75, in a rehearsal room at Saitama Arts Theater in Saitama.,
,Fellow actor Toshiko Tsumura echoes that sentiment, saying, “I’m 86 now, and I think I’ve reached my personal time limit, but I feel sorry for younger members who joined when they were 55 and are only in their early 70s now. They could still do so much more. I wish we could continue, but Saitama Arts Theater has decided now’s the time to wind down the company.”,Saitama Gold Theater was founded in 2006 by renowned theater director Yukio Ninagawa, then the artistic director of Saitama Arts Theater. From the outset, his vision was to create a troupe with players aged 55 and over. Ninagawa held open auditions that attracted 1,226 applicants from across Japan, with ages ranging from 55 to 80. From there, 48 people — with an average age of 66.7 — were selected to join the company and pursue their dreams to perform as stage actors.,Obuchi remembers those early days fondly. “I thought we would be guinea pigs for an experiment by Ninagawa to get an inner circle of oldies to study theater,” she says. “I never imagined we would be the leading players in proper performances that people would pay to come and see.,“But ever since Ninagawa summoned the media to announce Saitama Gold Theater’s launch, I’ve spent the past 15 years with my mouth wide open in surprise.”,The company has indeed had an exceptional run. Besides performing throughout Japan and collaborating with leading dramatists such as Ryo Iwamatsu, Keralino Sandorovich and Shu Matsui, it also received glowing reviews and packed audiences in cities around the world, including Paris, Hong Kong and Craiova, Romania, where they performed at the International Shakespeare Festival in 2016.,However, all the accolades can’t hide the fact that many of Saitama Gold Theater’s remaining 33 actors — who were all in the original cast — are now over 80 years old. Therefore, the decision to make “Mizu no Eki” the company’s swansong was hardly unexpected, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,From Dec. 19 to 26, four men and 14 women will perform Shogo Ota’s nonverbal 1981 masterpiece, which his theater company Tenkei Gekijo toured in Australia, the United States, Canada, South Korea and several European countries before his death in 2007. Saitama Gold Theater’s staging of the play has been entrusted to rising director Kunio Sugihara, who will be working with the troupe for the first time.,“When I got this chance to direct ‘Mizu no Eki,’ I didn’t know it would be Saitama Gold Theater’s final production,” says the 39-year-old dramatist. “In fact, I wondered if I was the right person for such an important event because I was just a fan of Ninagawa’s great works.,“Then I remembered that when he founded the company he said he wanted to make a new place where mature older people could find new faces and perspectives through physical expression. Since this nonverbal play is the ultimate form of physical expression, I believe it will be appropriate for their grand finale.”,As for working with a cast of older actors, Sugihara says he’s had a positive experience and the company itself is unique.,“Saitama Gold Theater may look like a rowdy troupe of oldsters, but they are very charming and — more importantly — they’re straightforward and honest. So, even if I get tired of having to speak in a loud voice because some of them have difficulty hearing, it’s very enjoyable,” he says with a laugh.,Although the cast members are now all veteran performers, there were still some difficulties in staging a nonverbal play.,“Right from the start till the very last moment, doing a nonverbal play has been a hard challenge,” Obuchi says. “It’s actually a very fitting way to mark the end of the era of Ninagawa’s pioneering Saitama Gold Theater.”,Tsumura chuckles and adds, “Of course, I thought it was lucky this play is nonverbal because I didn’t need to remember lines. Then I realized it’s more difficult to express the story silently just with my movements.,“When the rehearsals started we repeated walking very slowly over and over. Since we’re old, it’s difficult to walk for a long time … our legs are shaky and our bodies wobble.”,“But walking is the basis of any acting,” Obuchi says, “and I am excited to be learning such fundamental things even now.”,When asked what this wordless work is about, Sugihara says it has a rough plot in which people — a girl, two men, an old lady, a man and a woman, among others — approach a dripping tap and touch or play with the water before leaving one after another.,That’s basically it. Some of them fight, others put their legs under the water and rest, and a few — including Obuchi — appear to be carrying dead bodies.,“People get to the tap to drink water and charge themselves with energy to live until tomorrow,” the actress says. “So the play is about the nature of living and sensual connections. But I think it’s also about death, and my role is to face death.”,Since the entirety of the play is expressed through mime and there are no explanations about the characters’ backgrounds, the audience members have to figure out what is going on for themselves. Although he doesn’t give away much, Sugihara offers some additional insight: “The play is about people with a sense of despair and hopelessness inside, but they get inspiration and energy from touching the fresh water.”,However, Ota is on record giving a more specific explanation of his play, saying that the work depicts the sight of returnees from Japanese-occupied China. The dramatist himself was one of those returnees, having been born in Jinan in 1939 and coming to Japan after the end of World War II.,Despite that context, the director expects this staging to be different from the production he directed with actors around his age two years ago.,“Inevitably, the despair of young people and seniors is different”, he says. “For young people, it is a craving of the heart, but when the Saitama Gold Theater actors go to the tap I can see the chronicles of their entire lives and long-term yearnings in their appearance and way of moving. I’m not making value judgments, but they’re definitely different.”,Sugihara also says he has made adjustments from Ota’s play.,“For example, I changed one scene from being a man and a woman to a female couple,” he says. “That was partly because of the gender balance of the company’s current members. If I’d done the same thing with a younger cast, it would have come across as two regular lesbians. Looking at the couple played by older actors, though, I can see their agony as a social minority whose love for each other when they were young would’ve been such a taboo, and I can imagine the hardships they would’ve gone through.”,Now, as the final curtain call draws near and Ninagawa’s great project comes to a close, the sprightly Tsumura remains positive as ever and has no intention of giving up the stage completely.,“Once, I grumbled about my performance to a friend but she urged me to keep going. She told me, ‘You are my idol’ — so I think I should keep on and do a bit more performing with the local community,” she says with a smile.,Saitama Gold Theater’s “Mizu no Eki” (“The Water Station”) runs Dec. 19 to 26 at Saitama Arts Theater in Saitama City.

			,Contributing writers,How can contemporary theater affirm its raison d’etre at a time when going to see it live is viewed by many as an “unessential” activity? Even now, our third year in the pandemic, many arts events continue to be canceled, curtailed or forced to find other means of representation.,Theater Commons Tokyo (TCT), which kicks off its sixth edition today and runs until Feb. 27 at various locations in Tokyo’s Minato Ward and also online, addresses this problem head on with a program titled “Unsynchronized Voices.”,
,“The pandemic continues to forcibly synchronize the world,” writes Chiaki Soma in her note as TCT artistic director. “(Its) endless waves are akin to an omnipotent choreographer with the power to instantly overwrite our behaviors and gestures.”,This choreographed “dance” Soma refers to is one conducted through systems put in place by governments worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19, from social distancing and masking requirements, to border restrictions, vaccine passports and movement tracking. In an interview with The Japan Times, Soma explains that “the concept of ‘unsynchronized voices’ is not against government policies and protocols put in place to prevent the spread of the virus, but rather a chance to think independently of the control those measures exert on us physically and spiritually.”,TCT will present seven performance works and two forum discussions that not only offer radically different ways of creating, presenting and experiencing theater in the context of the pandemic, but challenge the very idea of what theater can be.,Among the three Japanese productions in the lineup, playwright and director Satoko Ichihara will present a new version of her play, “The Question of Faeries.” Ichihara was due to showcase “Madama Butterfly,” a co-production with Theater Neumarkt in Zurich, but it was canceled due to Japan’s current border restrictions.,“The Question of Faeries” was written in response to what is often referred to as the “Sagamihara stabbings,” when a former employee at a care home for people with disabilities in Kanagawa Prefecture killed 19 residents in 2016. The word “faeries” in the play’s title refers to mechanisms of discrimination that go overlooked in Japanese society.,The play is divided into three parts, each with its own particular dramatic form. Part one, “Ugly Woman,” draws on Japan’s , comedy tradition in a satirical take on the theme of beauty and ugliness. The second part, “Cockroach,” is a satirical musical that touches on issues of class, eugenics and anthropocentrism. The final part, “Mangurt,” is staged as a pseudo-seminar in which Ichihara questions the taboo status of female anatomy in traditional male-centered narratives of sexuality and reproduction, as well as the tendency to over-sterilize our environments. The latter theme is particularly resonant in the context of the pandemic.,Actress Tomoko Sato will deliver a performance in the form of a lecture titled “Index for Obake Tokyo: Chapter 1.” It will be a continuation of “Index for Obake Tokyo: Introduction,” which was presented at TCT last year. That lecture-performance pieced together references from literature, film, art, architecture and urban planning to construct an alternative plan of Tokyo from the perspective of , (ghosts).,Sato’s starting point was the 1965 treatise “Ghost Tokyo” by avant-garde artist Taro Okamoto. In the treatise, Okamoto sketches out the concept of , (polarism), which advocates maintaining the contradictions in human life rather than trying to resolve or dissolve them into a harmonious form. Thus, his “ghost” Tokyo is the conflictual and competing double of its real counterpart.,Sato brings the concept into the 21st century, reimagining the city against the backdrop of the pandemic, using voice, body, video projections and an array of innovative theatrical devices to rethink the present while also challenging the conventions of the lecture-performance format.,In “The Apocalypse of Women,” Kyun-Chome, a Tokyo-based artist unit comprised of Eri Homma and Nabuchi, asks what end-of-world narratives would look like if they were told by women. Drawing on extensive interviews with women in Japan from different walks of life, these visions of the future are packaged in mysterious parcels, which can either be picked up at TCT exhibition venues or sent to participants’ homes to be sampled until the end of March. The form this show takes is purposefully secretive, but if past installation works from Kyun-Chome are anything to go by, it promises to be evocative.,The remaining three works are by overseas artists. Shibaura House in Minato Ward will host “Suspended Delirium,” an installation by Berlin-based artists Monira Al Qadiri and Raed Yassin, in collaboration with media artist So Kanno. The piece is based on dialogues Qadiri and Yassin had as a couple living together during periods of lockdown in Germany. While many of their conversations revolved around the pandemic, they were also influenced by the major explosion that rocked Yassin’s hometown of Beirut in August 2020. The installation takes the form of three robots suspended in space with talking heads based on the two artists and their pet cat.,Also from Europe, the Dutch duo Suzan Boogaerdt and Bianca van der Schoot will present a lecture-performance titled “Traveling Without Moving.” The pair are known for creating works at the intersection of the performing and visual arts, real-world and virtual spaces. This new piece, which was commissioned by TCT, explores the theme of incubation, drawing on research into healing practices from East and West, the past and present, and asks whether theater can be a site for healing amid the pandemic era.,“One Another” is the umbrella title for a collection of video works and a lecture by Taiwanese artist, Hsu Che-Yu. The videos include “Single Copy” (2019), “The Unusual Death of a Mallard” (2020) and “The Making of Crime Scenes” (2021). In addition to the screenings of each of these recent works, Hsu will tie them together through a new research project on the interaction between animals and humans that is viewed through the histories of modernity and colonialism, but with a form that displaces anthropocentrism.,TCT will also host a workshop by Tokyo-based Reframe Lab, a collective of psychiatrists, curators, educators, interpreters and practitioners from the performing arts interested in the intersection between performance and care. Their workshop, “Nameless Games,” takes as its starting point the spontaneous games that children play, inventing worlds with their own stories and rules. The workshop aims to open participants’ own abstract or nameless worlds up to foster new modes of interrelation and understanding.,Rounding out the TCT roster are two forums. The first is on how to create “Unsynchronized Voices” in the arts and the second looks at the plurality of the world in the age of COVID-19 pandemic.,Soma notes that even though we are still in the midst of the pandemic and are therefore shortsighted as to its long term sociocultural effects, it is nonetheless crucial to engage with the here and now. “Unsynchronized Voices” is set to be a fascinating step in that direction.,Theater Commons Tokyo runs until Feb. 27 at various locations in Minato Ward, Tokyo.

			,Contributing writer,Hideki Ajima spent months preparing for this year’s “Sasuke,” adjusting his gym routine to focus on specific muscles that would help him conquer the famed obstacle course. The biggest challenge he faced, however, was a mental one.,“It was the wait before,” the 19-year-old performer currently part of talent agency Johnny & Associates Johnny’s Jr. group Shonen Ninja tells The Japan Times regarding his debut performance on the show. “While I was waiting for my turn (to run the course), I became hyper aware of just what my number was. Watching as other people fell and faced challenges made me think over how I had trained, what I had done and maybe not done.”,
,Anyone, even a J-pop performer, would be intimidated by the physical challenges laid out by “Sasuke,” which airs its end-of-year extravaganza on Dec. 28 at 6 p.m. on TBS. Since debuting in 1997, the series has presented celebrities and regular folks alike with challenging courses testing their athletic abilities, from jumps across pits to having to cross a balance beam through what looks like rotating punching bags — the “Fishbone.”,That’s just the first stage. True “Sasuke” legends make it all the way to the grueling fourth stage. If they complete that, they achieve “,” — an accomplishment awarded only 25 times in the show’s 24-year run.,The sheer challenge of “Sasuke” is one of the reasons the show has become a global cult hit, spawning 27 local versions around the world: from the United States, where it’s known as “American Ninja Warrior,” to Romania and Mongolia. In the world of intricate fan-maintained wiki projects, the “, features particular depth.,“I’ve been watching it on TV since I was little,” says Ryoichi Tsukada, a member of the group A.B.C-Z. “I’ve been doing gymnastics since the first grade, and I’ve always been confident when it comes to sports, so I had always wanted to try it out.”,Tsukada is the veteran “Sasuke” participant within the Johnny’s stable, having first tackled the course in 2015. The 35-year-old is one of four performers from Johnny’s participating in the 2021 edition of the competition. The others include first-timer Ajima; Snow Man’s Hikaru Iwamoto, with six previous appearances under his belt; and 7 Men Samurai’s Rinne Sugeta, who made his debut on “Sasuke” last year.,The Japan Times got a look at how the four pop stars trained for “Sasuke,” which has already been filmed, but we won’t know how they fared until the show airs. If they could tackle that obstacle course, though, then they are certain to stay strong when it comes to keeping spoilers under wraps. Hearing about the training sessions first-hand was enough to make me want to put an ice pack on my lower back.,To some degree, the Johnny’s participants have a leg up on most of us in aiming for “Sasuke” glory. The choreographed dancing and demands of performance mean pop stars need to be in good health, so all four were already routinely working out, with each noting an interest in fitness well before signing up with the agency.,“Before ‘Sasuke,’ I was mostly focused on weight training,” Iwamoto says, while Tsukada notes that he runs 10 kilometers at least three times a week, along with targeted gym days (legs, arms, back, etc.).,“When I found out in July that I’d be taking part in it this year, I changed my approach to training,” Ajima says. “I placed an emphasis on clearing the first stage, so as much as possible I focused on training my arms.”,The first stage of the course includes the dreaded “Dragon Glider,” which requires the competitor to leap up, latch onto a pole, glide forward down a track on said pole and then jump to a different pole, grabbing and gripping it.,Tsukada echoes Ajima’s strategy. “So I trained my forearms for the Dragon Glider — which I failed the very first time I was on ‘Sasuke’ — and then did lots of squats so I could get up the ‘Warped Wall.’”,Iwamoto says he started bouldering to increase his grip, as did Sugeta. “I wanted to strengthen my fingers, so I’d do those sorts of activities with friends,” says Iwamoto, who adds that this was done with the intention of advancing past the second stage, which he wasn’t able to do last year.,Even the fanciest Tokyo gyms aren’t likely to have a moat or warped wall, though. It takes a keen sense of strategy to figure out what exercises you’ll need to complete the challenges.,“It’s meaningless if you can’t use the muscles you gained training for ‘Sasuke,’” says Tsukada, who does something that hardcore participants — the type who become fixtures on the show year after year — all tend to do: practice on homemade versions of the “Sasuke” course. In Tsukada’s case, this meant traveling to other seasoned players’ homes and ,s. He filmed those experiences for the official “Sasuke” YouTube channel.,For all four, finding small ways to improve their strength and stamina during their musical activities proved vital. Sugeta says he stopped using elevators and ran up stairs as much as possible while working on a show at Tokyo’s Imperial Theatre — emphasizing the “running” part — while also finding ways to strengthen his fingers, primarily by hanging off of things.,“I’d find ways to just hang during productions and live shows,” Iwamoto says of his work-exercise balance.,No matter how much you train, though, that first day of filming is likely to produce the kind of jitters that Ajima felt while waiting for his turn to challenge the course. Sugeta says he remembers the feeling well, sitting there and watching the Fishbone take out other competitors before him was stressful even for someone used to performing in front of scores of fans. Tsukada emphasizes the importance of getting enough sleep and eating well before “Sasuke,” while Iwamoto is more aware of his well-being. “I’m very conscious of not accumulating too much stress in the two weeks leading up to the show,” he says. A lot of us may not ever tackle the “Sasuke” course, but this also might be good advice for those hoping to tackle a Mount Fuji climb next year.,“One of the most important things you have to do is create the feeling that you will not lose,” Tsukada says. “You , press the red button (that signals you’ve completed the challenge) at the end of the stage.” He adds that wearing the right shoes is also vital.,Ajima says that by the time his number was called, the nerves and self-doubt dissipated, and he felt better actually hitting the course. Like in any form of dedicated training, “Sasuke” participants tend to set goals: Clear the first stage in your first year, aim to complete the second stage in your second year. Though he still doesn’t let on how he actually fared on the course, he does say that he is already imagining more specialized training to help conquer “Sasuke”-specific challenges.,All four of the competitors say that taking part gives them a sense of achievement, which is empowering.,“The biggest thing I really felt was having accomplished something,” Sugeta says. “Specifically, accomplishing something as a result of one’s own ethics of hard work, drive and training. ‘Sasuke,’ and being a part of it, has really inspired me, which to me is the most important part of the whole experience.”,The ”Sasuke” end-of-year episode will air on Dec. 28 at 6 p.m on TBS.

			,Contributing writer,Looking for a love story this holiday season? Or perhaps you’d rather indulge in some messier romantic competition? Either way, streaming services have you covered with two Japanese shows that blur the line between reality and drama.,Netflix’s “The Future Diary,” which premiered on Dec. 14, aims to re-create the romance-fueled absurdity of a Japanese television drama in the real world. Two strangers are brought together and act out a love story guided by the titular book, which gives them instructions and prompts to further their relationship. The plots are ripped from familiar tropes on Japanese TV shows except for the fairy tale ending — in a truly melodramatic touch, the couple must say farewell at the end, even if they’ve fallen for one another.,
,The premise is one that originally debuted as the popular centerpiece segment of the late-1990s variety show “Unnan no Hontoko!”,The Netflix reboot, made in conjunction with TBS, focuses on Maai Nakasone from Okinawa and Takuto Wakamatsu from Hokkaido. The pair get to know one another in ways both familiar (coffee at a cafe) and ridiculous (forced to cook dinner for a boat full of impatient people). The Future Diary itself directs them, telling them things like when to have their first kiss.,Between segments, a panel of four Japanese celebrities — singer Daigo Naito, Exile member Taiki Sato, TV personality Saya and TV Tokyo announcer Reina Sumi — offer analysis of what they see. This is a format familiar to audiences in Asia but may only be recognizable to fans of the show “Terrace House” elsewhere. That show’s commentators were one of the best parts of the viewing experience, but on “The Future Diary,” at least for the first three episodes, their contributions are somewhat unnecessary.,Despite knowing how it all ends — the very first scene of the first episode shows Maai and Takuto tearfully accepting the fact that they have to say goodbye — “The Future Diary” is fun because it focuses on the romantic journey rather than the bittersweet result, and it makes for great comfort viewing. The real world might not resemble a rom-com, but Netflix can at least make it seem possible for 30-minute bursts.,Amazon Prime’s “The Bachelor Japan,” which premiered on Nov. 25, ignores the Japanese drama tradition in favor of the current American approach of turning everything into a contest. The show, now in its fourth season, follows the same beats as the U.S. version of the reality competition with women from across Japan vying for the affection of one man, this time a quadrilingual Chinese businessman named Kou Kou, taking part in various competitions to grab his attention. Similar to “The Future Diary,” a panel offers commentary in between the action, though the “Bachelor” crew — singer Rino Sashihara and comedians Koji Imada and Shingo Fujimori — is much funnier than the subdued cast “The Future Diary” brought together.,The series differ drastically in tone — “The Future Diary” aims to re-create a drama while “The Bachelor Japan” simply revels in it — but both don’t seem to kid themselves when it comes to the goal of providing entertainment. While centered around real people in the real world, the lovebirds on “The Future Diary” are basically improvising over a loose script, while “The Bachelor Japan” provides fantastical scenarios in a , — when was the last time you had to perform rhythmic gymnastics to get a second date?,We all just want a little love, even if you can see the entertainment industry strings holding it together.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Life in Japan slows down considerably during the new year period — ,, on Dec. 31, and ,, specifically Jan. 1, 2 and 3. So how do you fill this string of holidays? Why not stay in and watch some TV … it’s not like we’ve had too much of that over the past two years.,What sets this weekend apart from the rest of the year, though, is that you don’t need to binge a stream of videos on YouTube or catch up on all those Netflix shows you’ve been putting off for some quality entertainment. Japanese broadcast television’s slate of new year programming features star-studded blowouts that offer the perfect drip, drip, drip of moderately entertaining content to pass the time until 2022.,
,The most celebrated New Year’s Eve option remains NHK’s “Kohaku Uta Gassen” (Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m.), a music extravaganza that provides a snapshot of the year in music via a string of live performances. While not the ratings powerhouse it was in the past (many a Japanese grandmother will have the show on in the background during dinner), it’s still an incredibly popular way to count down the clock to midnight.,This year’s “Kohaku” balances heavyweights from the past with emerging new names, ranging from glum-pop purveyors Yoasobi to rockers Dish// to peppy popsters NiziU and more. Actors Haruna Kawaguchi and Yo Oizumi will take over hosting duties, and viewers can anticipate a slightly more progressive version of the show than what’s come in the past, as NHK has given the nod to shifting identity terms and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals in promoting this year’s edition.,Usually, the best counter programming to “Kohaku” is comedy duo Downtown’s “Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!” That comedy buffet of slapping and spanking, though, is done for good, leaving a big hole in New Year’s Eve lineups.,You could fill it with violence, thanks to Fuji TV’s Rizin special (Dec. 31, 6 p.m.), which finds a loaded card of MMA fighters walloping on one another. Or you could try to find some new funny stuff courtesy of TV Asahi’s “Zawatsuku! Omisoka” (Dec. 31, 6 p.m.), broadcasting for the third year in a row and offering “humorous commentary” on various social trends.,The bulk of comedy and variety specials air in the first few days of 2022. The closest thing to “Gaki” might be “Geinojin Kakuzuke Check” (Jan. 1, 5 p.m.) on TV Asahi, wherein celebrities form teams to face various challenges, with this year’s lineup including comedians, musicians such as Yoshiki from X Japan, and baseball manager-turned-meme Shinjo.,For those craving something more traditional, there’s Nippon TV’s “Shoten” (Jan. 1, 3 p.m.), which channels ancient entertainment for laughs. A day later provides more variety, via the TBS culinary special “Bananaman no Sekkaku Gourmet” (Jan. 2, 5 p.m.) and TV Asahi’s “Sports King” (Jan 2, 6:30 p.m.), which focuses on athletes. Or, take part in a long Japanese tradition by watching the Hakone Ekiden, a long-distance marathon that is held on Jan. 2 and 3, and which will be broadcast on Nippon TV from 7 a.m.,Among the most anticipated New Year’s programming are special episodes of popular dramas. The problem is, unless you are familiar with said series, it might be a bit too much to take in when you are just trying to stay warm at home. The one exception is TV Tokyo’s venerable “Kodoku no Gourmet” New Year’s special (Dec. 31, 10 p.m.). The show revolves around a worker who goes around, eats meals at real restaurants by himself, and comments on them. That’s it. And it’s perfect. The 2021 special finds the titular solitary gourmet embarking on a road trip to gobble up all kinds of delights. It’s perfect holiday fare to let wash over you, as you prepare to face 2022.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Sorry, fans of love stories! In the lead-up to the latest season of Netflix’s “Aggretsuko,” trailers teased a will-they-won’t-they relationship between main character Retsuko and her doofy but well-meaning co-worker Haida. Instead, the newest 10 episodes from the Sanrio-born property explore the crushing truths of the modern workplace and the angst of being a cog in the capitalist machine.,
,What has made “Aggretsuko” so popular since its debut in 2018 is how it offers a relatable and reflective take on contemporary life. The show revolves around a 20-something red panda named Retsuko who’s employed in the accounting division at a trading firm. She deals with tyrannical bosses, unreasonable amounts of overtime and a slew of other problems that are recognizable to young people currently trying to navigate Japanese corporate culture. After work she lets off steam by indulging in some death metal at karaoke.,It’s a simple premise that’s exceptionally entertaining, featuring compelling story arcs and characters you can empathize with. The third season saw Retsuko dabbling in the world of pop music, and wound up being a pretty engaging commentary on Japan’s idol-pop system. However, the fourth season, released on Dec. 16, ventures into some truly bleak storylines about how work influences our self-worth.,The CEO of Retsuko’s company — an old-school elephant out of step and obsessed with building a theme park while profits tumble — suffers a medical emergency, forcing him to step away from his position. A suave young director named Saluki Himuro is then brought in to guide the company forward.,His bold new approaches involve downsizing by implementing layoffs, especially of longstanding employees who have been with the company since the good ol’ days of the freewheeling 1980s bubble era. Retsuko’s oftentimes commanding supervisor, a pig named Ton, and a gossipy middle-aged hippo named Kabae both get the axe, and what follows are the grim realities of corporate life — forced resignations of workers over age 45, workplace bullying and the slow rot of office morale.,“Aggretsuko” does get around to the relationship drama between Retsuko and Haida, but even that developing romance hits a snag thanks to work woes.,Fortunately, the show’s compassion toward all its characters keeps things chugging along. “Aggretsuko” has always humanized even its most unlikeable characters, and the slow reveal of their redeeming qualities becomes a central theme over the course of season four. Saluki, who could have been written off as a heartless executive, is presented as doing whatever he can to save the company — it just happens to push him to dark and illegal places.,The show isn’t about bad behavior, it’s about toxic work environments grinding up employees and forcing them to extremes. That feeling is what makes the season hit hard, and when the final three episodes pivot to lightness, it’s comforting. (After watching Retsuko and her colleagues question their value and burn out on work, it’s a delight when we see Kabae wearing night vision goggles and shimmying through air ducts!),“Aggretsuko” season four is a notable addition to television shows offering dramatized insights into capitalism and how it affects the individual — an animated “Squid Game,” of sorts.,Come for the death-metal shrieks of a sweet-looking red panda, stay for the all-too-relatable sense of doing whatever it takes to stay afloat in the modern world.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Bob Saget, the stand-up comic and actor known as Danny Tanner on “Full House” and the host of “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” was found dead Sunday in Florida. He was 65.,His death was confirmed by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, which said Saget was found unresponsive in a hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes. The cause of death was not known, but the sheriff’s office said there were no signs of foul play or drug use.,
,Saget had performed Saturday night at Ponte Vedra Concert Hall in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, southeast of Jacksonville.,In a tweet early Sunday, Saget thanked the “appreciative audience.”,“I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight,” he said. “I’m happily addicted again to this.”,On “Full House,” Saget played a widowed father who shared his house with his three daughters, his brother-in-law and his best friend. The show, which aired from 1987 to 1995, launched Saget and his co-stars — including John Stamos, Lori Loughlin, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen — into the realm of household names.,Saget, born in Philadelphia, graduated from Temple University in 1978 before finding his way into comedy clubs. In contrast to his squeaky-clean image on “Full House” and “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” Saget delighted in raunchy, profanity-laden stand-up routines.,At Temple, he studied film, and the year of his graduation, he received a student Academy Award for documentary merit for his film “Through Adam’s Eyes,” about a nephew of his who had had facial reconstructive surgery.,But even then, he was already pursuing comedy. He told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2016 that, at 17, he won a local radio contest by singing a song about bondage, and that although he spent most of his time at Temple shooting film, he would also go to the University of Pennsylvania to do improv.,After graduating, Saget moved to Los Angeles and quickly made himself a constant presence at The Comedy Store. “I lived in that room for seven years,” he said on comedian Marc Maron’s podcast in 2010.,“I did jokes and some stories, but most of them were just silly, dirty silly,” he remembered. He said he was drawn to jokes with foul language and anatomy because it was what he wasn’t supposed to say growing up. “I stayed like a kid who just talked silly.”,He added, deadpan and possibly sincere, “I don’t curse for the sake of cursing, that’s the actual truth.”,After a brief stint on a CBS show, “The Morning Program,” Saget appeared in a 1987 Richard Pryor film, “Critical Condition.” He then got offered the part on “Full House.” He later joked with Maron, “My joke is, ‘Ask me my favorite episode?’”,“What’s your favorite episode,” Maron played along.,“The last one,” Saget said. Almost immediately, he added, “I’m the luckiest guy.”,Saget became the first host of “America’s Funniest Home Videos” in 1989, and although most of his commentary was in line with the character he played on “Full House” — funny voices and groan-inducing puns — his mordant wit sometimes slipped in.,In a statement Sunday night, the Saget family said they were “devastated” to confirm his death.,“He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter,” the family said.,In a tweet posted Sunday night, Stamos, who played Jesse Katsopolis on “Full House,” said he was “broken” and “gutted.”,“I am in complete and utter shock,” he said. “I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.”,Survivors include his wife, Kelly Rizzo, and three daughters, Aubrey Saget, Lara Melanie Saget and Jennifer Belle Saget.,After “Full House” ended, Saget directed a television movie, “For Hope,” that fictionalized the story of how his sister, Gay, grew ill and died of systemic scleroderma. (He later became a board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation.) He also directed a comedy starring Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange, “Dirty Work,” which was widely panned on its release in 1998.,Returning to the comedy circuit and mocking his wholesome TV alter ego, Saget developed a cult following as a comedian who could unleash torrents of scatological material. In 2010, he hosted a documentary series, “Strange Days With Bob Saget,” in which he spent time with pro wrestlers, bikers, Bigfoot hunters and others.,On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in 2017, Saget recalled how Don Rickles, a longtime friend of his and Stamos’, described his act. “He comes out like a Jewish Clark Kent,” Saget said, before launching into a song about a dog, a monkey and a verb repeatedly censored on network television.,But Saget never totally relinquished his family man persona: He voiced the narrator of “How I Met Your Mother,” an older wiser version of the show’s protagonist.,“My first thought was why can’t he do it? Or how much cigarettes and booze do you have to have to sound like me?” Saget told Larry King in 2014. But, he added, “I did it immediately because I read it. It was a love letter, it was a relationship show.”,

			,Staff writer,When I first heard that NHK was airing a show called “The Mating Game,” I assumed it was the national broadcaster’s answer to “Terrace House” — a beautifully shot voyeuristic look into the lives of young couples.,And in many ways I was right, except that, in “The Mating Game,” the human subjects have been replaced with infinitely more interesting specimens from the animal world.,
,Co-produced with Silverback Films, the U.K.-based studio behind David Attenborough’s “Planet Earth” series, “The Mating Game” (“Koi Suru Ikimono-tachi no Chosen,” in Japanese) follows the intricate, elegant and frequently deceptive courting rituals of 80 species in 22 different countries. It is also the first natural history series to be shot entirely in 8K.,“Grasslands,” the first of five episodes in the series, opens on a group of ostriches, almost 2½-meters tall and silhouetted against the arid backdrop of the Namibian savannah. As with any natural history documentary that Silverback Films is involved in, each shot brings to life the glorious detail of the scene, while also demonstrating the studio’s uncanny knack of being in exactly the right place at the right time to film the most intimate and unexpected of animal behaviors.,In an effort to woo one of the females, a gangly male ostrich takes to his knees and begins a surprisingly graceful courtship dance, swaying from side to side in an attempt to impress his would-be mate. Ultimately successful, the documentary pulls no punches in showing the intricacies of what follows, with little detail lost in the 8K format.,What makes the series even more impressive is that large parts of it were filmed throughout the pandemic.,“We had to cancel shoots in 18 locations,” says Taishi Inoue, one of the program directors, who filmed on location in the Dominican Republic and Kenya. “And we had to follow a detailed list of protocols to make sure that everything was filmed safely.”,“The Mating Game” is still rich in footage — from stunning aerials of zebra herds as they march across the savannah to extreme close-ups of a termite queen giving birth to thousands of larvae in quick succession, and jacked kangaroos fighting each other like testosterone junkies at a gym. At one point a “cross-dressing” bird enters the scene, disguising itself as the female of its species in order to outwit its male competitors.,Where the upgrade from 4K to 8K seems most noticeable is in the close-ups, as the skin of an animal ripples in its daily labors, or the air shimmers around it in the heat of the midday sun. The interplay of light across various natural surfaces — golden hour through dew-covered stalks of grass, the dim tunnels of an underground termite lair — all benefit from the upgrade in resolution.,“I think the depth of the image is totally different when compared with 2K and 4K,” says Inoue. “And the color is too, you can see the details even in the shadows.”,Ultimately, what really stands out is not the format, instead the sheer variety of the natural world, and the magnificent displays of beauty and cunning, as each species goes about its mating game.,“The Mating Game” premieres in 8K on NHK BS8K on Jan. 16 at 7 p.m. It will air on regular NHK channels later in 2022.

			,KYODO,Once an importer of “boys’ love” (BL) media from Japan, Thailand has now brought the genre full circle with its growing range of dramas themed on romances between impossibly beautiful young men.,
,
,Known locally as “Y series” — a reference to the Japanese term “,” that refers to works featuring homoerotic relationships between male characters — these homegrown dramas have been on the rise following the success of the 2016 Thai BL series “Sotus.”,
,But it wasn’t until the release of “2gether,” a 13-episode series about two handsome college boys who go from being in a fake relationship to falling in love, that the flame for a boom in Japan was well and truly ignited.,The show, produced by Thai television production studio GMMTV Co., debuted in February 2020 and soon became a hit overseas due to the “stay-at-home” lifestyle brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.,“One of the greatest draws (of the show) is that viewers can learn about a culture different to that of Japan, such as food and fashion,” says a spokesperson for Contents Seven Co., a video licensing company that promptly acquired the Japanese distribution rights for “2gether.”,While the Tokyo-based company had previously imported BL dramas from China and Taiwan, it decided to pick up its first Thai one when it saw potential in “2gether” even before it had aired. Through January, the series, which first streamed in Japan on Rakuten TV in July 2020, has been released on 13 domestic streaming platforms and aired on 10 TV stations.,Yui, a Japanese fan living in Bangkok, says she began watching Thai BL last May after hearing about its popularity in Japan. In no time, she was hooked.,“The first thing that attracted me to Thai BL was the beautiful faces of the actors. The more I watched, the more I found that the chemistry between the actors and their roles was so great that I was able to get emotionally involved,” she says, adding that it also presented her with a perfect opportunity to learn the language.,Yui, who first moved to Thailand in 2012, recently collaborated with travel company H.I.S. Tours Co. to take fans on a virtual “pilgrimage” tour to locations in the Southeast Asian country where some scenes in “2gether” were set.,According to H.I.S. Tours, the online tour held on Feb. 11 attracted over 250 people, nearly 99 percent of them women, with those in their 40s and 50s making up over 76 percent of participants. The event was so well-received that plans for future Thai BL tours are already in the works.,“We came up with the idea for the tour as we felt many people would want to see the locations, even at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult to physically visit (Thailand),” a H.I.S. Tours spokesperson says.,Japanese television and publishing companies have also jumped on board the Thai BL train. After announcing a business partnership with GMMTV in November 2020, TV Asahi held exhibitions in Tokyo and other major cities across Japan in collaboration with the studio throughout last year.,Meanwhile, major Japanese publishing company Kadokawa Corp. has been acquiring the rights to translate original Thai novels through its local subsidiary Kadokawa Amarin Co., officially launching its foray into Thai BL with the release of the Japanese edition of “Manner of Death” in January 2021.,Set in a fictional rural town in northern Thailand, “Manner of Death” depicts a romance between a forensic pathologist and a suspect in a murder case, offering a refreshing change from campus-based, vanilla themes typically used in Thai BL.,A drama adaption premiered on WeTV, the international streaming platform of Chinese IT giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., in November 2020.,
,
,The novel’s original author Sammon, a doctor by day, says it was “beyond (her) imagination” to be recognized in Japan, a country that produced the manga she grew up reading and from which she draws inspiration in her works.,“I really love Japanese culture, and now we can send something back for Japanese people to be able to know Thai people and Thai culture. I am very happy, and very appreciative as a Thai person,” she says, naming Ayano Yamane and Kou Yoneda as among her favorite Japanese BL manga artists.,“Manner of Death” also became one of the first Thai BL novels to be serialized into a manga by Kadokawa in March 2021, with Sammon working on the character designs with artist Yukari Umemoto.,“My dream is to go to a bookstore and to find my work, a Japanese ‘Manner of Death’ or ‘Grab a Bite’ (another of her BL novels) there, and then I will be so happy,” she says.,Thai government agencies are also pinning high hopes on a Thai drama sensation in Japan. Last April, the Thai Embassy in Japan held a “Thai Drama Festival” in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward, hosting virtual meetings with famous Thai BL actors, among other cultural activities.,The Tourism Authority of Thailand, which started a project to promote Thai BL in Japan in September 2020, hopes the trend will encourage more Japanese people to visit the country after the pandemic is contained.,“There are many people who started to become interested in Thailand through Thai dramas, and we hope they will come and experience the culture and charm of Thai culture for themselves once travel becomes easier again,” according to an official of the agency.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Bob Dylan sold his entire back catalog of recorded music along with “the rights to multiple future new releases” to Sony Music Entertainment, the company announced Monday, the latest high-profile deal of the recent music rights purchasing rush.,Sony did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. In late 2020 the iconic American artist had already sold his songwriting rights — separate from recording rights, which govern reproduction and distribution — to Universal, in a deal estimated to be worth more than $300 million.,
,According to industry reports including from Billboard and Variety, the latest Dylan deal was worth some $200 million.,Sony said it closed the recording rights transaction in July 2021, a tightening of Dylan’s six-decade relationship with the company.,The author of folk rock classics including “Like a Rolling Stone” and “Tangled Up in Blue” was signed to Sony’s Columbia Records in 1961, and recorded his debut album the same year.,Hailing the singer-songwriter’s “unrivaled genius,” Rob Stringer, Sony Music Group’s chairman, said “Columbia Records has had a special relationship with Bob Dylan from the beginning of his career and we are tremendously proud and excited to be continuing to grow and evolve our ongoing 60-year partnership.”,Dylan also lauded the agreement in a statement: “Columbia Records and Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records. I’m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong.”,Sony said it planned to collaborate with Dylan on “a range of future catalog reissues in the artist’s renowned and top-selling Bootleg Series,” a project that began in 1991 and has seen the artist make public more rare, previously unreleased studio and live material.,The terms also allow Sony to partner with Dylan “on additional projects.”,
,
,In 2020 Dylan released his 39th studio album — “Rough and Rowdy Ways” — to critical acclaim.,At 80 years old he continues to tour extensively, just Monday announcing a string of new dates in the U.S. South, part of a worldwide run slated to continue into 2024.,Dylan’s deal with Sony is separate from his blockbuster publishing sale to Universal.,The holders of master recording rights can dictate future reissues, while publishing rights owners receive a cut in a number of scenarios, including radio play and streaming, album sales, and use in advertising and movies.,The prolific Dylan has been covered countless times, making his songwriting catalog particularly valuable.,His publishing deal with Universal was one of the highest profile sales that preceded a flurry of music catalog transactions over the past year or so, as financial markets are increasingly drawn to music portfolios as an asset class.,The trend is driven in large part by the anticipated stability of streaming growth combined with low interest rates and dependable earning projections for time-tested hits.,It’s also useful for artists focused on estate planning.,Companies have acquired a number of major catalogs including from David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, Paul Simon, Motley Crue, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Shakira.,Springsteen sold both his publishing and recorded music rights to Sony for a staggering $500 million.,And earlier this month Bowie’s estate sold the late singer’s publishing rights to Warner Chappell Music.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,JIJI,Japanese dancer Tsukino Tanaka won second place on Saturday at this year’s Prix de Lausanne, a prestigious international competition for young ballet dancers in Montreux, Switzerland.,“It’s unbelievable. It’s like a dream,” said Tanaka, a 17-year-old from Higashiosaka, Osaka Prefecture, wiping away tears. “It was not perfect, but dancing at this dream stage was a lot of fun.”,
,Tanaka started dancing ballet at age 4 and has been studying at a school in Zurich since August 2020.,She has been forced to practice at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,“It was difficult because I couldn’t move as I wanted, but I did all kinds of things such as using sound-proof sheets,” she said of her practice.,Japanese dancer Sachiya Takata, an 18-year-old from Yokohama, was also one of the finalists, but failed to win a prize. Yet he said that “becoming a finalist gave me confidence.”,Hiyou Shimizu, an 18-year-old with dual citizenship in Japan and Australia, was another a finalist who fell short of the top awards. “I did my best,” Shimizu said, adding “I’m satisfied with the outcome.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,The original, iconic ending of the cult U.S. film “Fight Club” has been restored to screens in China after a censored version that brought all criminals to book sparked outrage online.,Beijing has some of the world’s most restrictive censorship rules with authorities only approving a handful of foreign films for release each year — sometimes with major cuts.,
,But reversing endings is rare, and there was widespread anger after censors replaced the original finale of “Fight Club” on a version streaming on platform Tencent Video.,In the original closing scenes, star Edward Norton’s narrator kills his imaginary alter-ego Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, before watching multiple buildings explode, suggesting his character’s plan to bring down modern civilization came to fruition.,But the version on Tencent instead closed with a line of text on a black screen to say the police “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals.”,In a rare censorship reversal, however, Tencent this week began to air the original conclusion of David Fincher’s film, including the iconic explosive ending that was trimmed last month.,The ending in which the state triumphs had sparked head scratching and outrage among some Chinese viewers — many of whom would likely have seen pirated versions of the unadulterated film.,Human Rights Watch described the cuts as “dystopian.”,Author Chuck Palahniuk, who wrote the 1996 novel that “Fight Club” was adapted from, tweeted that China had “done the right thing.”,Tencent did not reply to questions on what led to the censorship, nor its abrupt reversal, which prompted more debate online.,“Now, I’m speechless!” wrote one Chinese film fan, with the sentiment echoed across social media.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Ivan Reitman, a producer and director of a string of movies including “Ghostbusters” and “National Lampoon’s Animal House” that imprinted their antics on the funny bones of a generation of filmgoers, died Saturday at his home in Montecito, California, The Associated Press reported. He was 75.,His children, Jason Reitman, Catherine Reitman, and Caroline Reitman, confirmed the death in a statement to the AP.,
,During his decadeslong career, with credits as recent as last year, Reitman produced and directed major box-office comedies that became iconic to the generations that grew up with them and contributed to the rise of actors like Bill Murray and Arnold Schwarzenegger, whom he cast in the unlikely role of a police officer masquerading as a kindergarten teacher in “Kindergarten Cop” (1990).,He produced, with Matty Simmons, the 1978 movie “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” an hour-and-a-half-long depiction of Greek life’s chaotic energy and absurdity that has become one of the most beloved comedies in the history of the genre. The film injected the concept of the toga party into modern culture. After the staggering success of “Animal House,” he returned to directing, later telling The New York Times that he regretted not directing it.,His 1984 film “Ghostbusters,” which he did direct, was nominated for two Oscars, despite lukewarm reviews from some critics, who complained of disjointed humor that heavily prioritized special effects.,Viewers disagreed, enthralled and entertained by Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Murray clad in heavily accessorized jumpsuits and the bizarre visuals that included a 100-foot-high marshmallow dressed in a sailor suit and a neon green ghost. Five years later, he directed a sequel, “Ghostbusters II,” and he helped produce another spinoff, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” that was directed by his son, Jason, and released last year.,In a 2007 interview with the CBC, he recalled the first time he saw the three stars of “Ghostbusters” in their outlandish ghostbusting outfits, rounding Madison Avenue for a pre-shoot. “There was just something so extraordinary about that image,” he said. “I turned to the script assistant next to me and said, ‘I think this movie’s gonna work.’ ”,Ivan Reitman was born in Komarno, in what is now Slovakia, on Oct. 27, 1946, to Jewish parents who survived the Nazis. Four years later, his family fled Czechoslovakia to escape communism and eventually landed in Toronto.,“We came here penniless,” he told the CBC in 2007 as he was about to get a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame. “I didn’t speak the language.”,He began producing movies as a student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.,Working off-Broadway on “The National Lampoon Show,” he forged an early partnership with Ramis and with John Belushi and Murray before they became stars on “Saturday Night Live.”,After “Animal House,” he directed “Meatballs” (1979), starring Murray as the head counselor at a chaotic summer camp, and “Stripes” (1981), in which Murray plays a rebellious Army recruit.,Survivors include his children Jason, Catherine and Caroline.,“Our family is grieving the unexpected loss of a husband, father, and grandfather who taught us to always seek the magic in life,” they told the AP. “We take comfort that his work as a filmmaker brought laughter and happiness to countless others around the world. While we mourn privately, we hope those who knew him through his films will remember him always.”,

,That would make Maezawa a tidy profit on the artwork, which he purchased in 2016 for $57.3 million.,The mega-rich founder of Japan’s largest online fashion mall said in the statement that the past six years of owning the painting were “a great pleasure”.,But art “should be shared so that it can be a part of everyone’s lives,” he added.,Ahead of its sale, the massive artwork will go on international tour, being displayed in London, Los Angeles and Taipei, the statement said.,Maezawa, who in 2017 set a new auction record for Basquiat works when he paid $110.5 million for another painting by the 20th century giant, also said he plans to create a new museum to exhibit his collection.,He founded the Contemporary Art Foundation in Tokyo and was on the 2017 list of “Top 200 Collectors” by the ARTnews magazine based in New York.,He has been in the headlines more recently for becoming the first space tourist to travel to the International Space Station with Russia’s space agency.,His odyssey is believed to have cost around ¥10 billion ($87 million), and he plans to follow it up with a trip around the Moon organized by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,An exhibition showing 103 publicly unseen sketches by Japanese ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai will open at London's British Museum on Thursday.,The postcard-sized sketches were created by Hokusai (1760-1849) in the 1820s to the 1840s and were intended to become woodblock prints for a visual encyclopedia titled ""The Great Picture Book of Everything,"" which covered topics from the natural world to Buddhist lore and life in ancient India and China.,
,According to the museum, the volume was never published and the so-called ""block-ready"" drawings, or ,, were preserved in their original form.,At an advance viewing of the exhibit, curator Alfred Haft explained the chance discovery and expert investigation that brought the sketches to public view some 200 years after their creation.,Haft said that the sketches resurfaced at a small auction in Paris in 2019, attributed to a different artist.,Suspecting the drawings to be Hokusai's work, art dealer Israel Goldman approached the museum's Hokusai specialists and ""after consultation with experts worldwide, it was confirmed they were by Hokusai,"" he said.,The curator shared his delight at the works finally being displayed to the public, with the exhibit having been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.,""Hokusai was always reinventing himself as an artist and we are happy to be able to share in this as a discovery and a reopening of knowledge about Japan and Hokusai's life."",According to Haft, Hokusai represented the wide range of subjects in his sketches ""with equal facility and interest … he seems to be interested in everything."",Haft cited as a highlight an image of Taoist master Zhou Sheng ascending to the moon. ""(It's) a fantastic story of aspiration and achieving the impossible, which is what Hokusai did,"" referring to the artist's ambition to create a record of ""everything"" for the unpublished encyclopedia project.,The exhibit will run through Jan. 30.

			,Contributing writer,During the installation of this year’s Kyotographie international photography festival, which is currently running at various locations around Kyoto, an electric fan fell over at Nijo Castle, possibly leaving a slight mark on the wall of the World Heritage Site. For a few days it looked like one of the photography festival’s most impressive venues would be canceled.,One of the exhibitors, Richard Collasse, who is also chairman of the board at Chanel Japan, had things to say about the incident at his pre-exhibition talk. A tongue-lashing of Kyoto and Japan by a senior figure of a global fashion brand is not something you hear every day. While praising Kyotographie for being an important way for Kyoto to develop as a cultural center, he also castigated the city for being “the most closed society in a country whose spirit is still closed to the world.” That a small incident should blow up into such a huge issue was, in Collasse’s view, “a very Japanese problem.” The mainly Japanese audience that was present nodded and lightly tittered.,
,One reason Kyotoites might have been amused rather than offended by Collasse’s chastisement is that if you love where you live, an outsider’s frustration at your exclusivity isn’t a problem, it’s an affirmation. On the “love Kyoto” side, there is the artist couple and Kyotographie contributors RongRong and inri, who moved to the city six years ago. When I ask RongRong, who is originally from Fujian, China, what it was like to live in Kyoto, he says he would gladly stay forever.,“Being from China I felt a strong sense of continuity, through Buddhist tradition, connecting Kyoto to my own roots,” he says. “Other than that, the air, the smells — things that can’t be put into words — this is Kyoto for me.”,Taking into account that Kyotographie is an international festival and provides access to Japan’s ancient heritage shows that Kyotoites are at least willing to share on occasion. And with reports of a budget crunch in Japan’s crown jewel, an artistic festival is a pretty on-brand way to do so.,
,
,In recognition of the ongoing pandemic as well as the 10th anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake, Kyotographie’s theme this year is “Echo.”,As such, one of the centerpiece exhibitions is Dutch photographic artist Erwin Olaf’s “Annus Mirabilis,” which combines two series created during the pandemic. Located at the Museum of Kyoto Annex, the first of the series, “April Fool,” reflects the absurdity of life in lockdown. The second, “Im Wald” (“In the Forest”), is an extraordinary demonstration of what digital photography can do in terms of creating vast and impeccably detailed images with perfect exposure. The impact of Olaf’s images is enhanced by the complementary design of the exhibition, which takes us from dark claustrophobic corridors showing “April Fool” into an expansive white space for the “Im Wald” section. The whole thing is visually seductive, but the easy and deferential recycling of 19th-century painterly aesthetic seems regressive rather than contemporary.,The five exhibits at the almost-canceled Nijo Castle venue include Kazuma Obara’s “Fill in the Blanks,” which uses different recording techniques to remind us that in major disasters there are many individual stories of suffering. Ikebana master Atsunobu Katagiri’s “Sacrifice” uses the type of black bags used to store irradiated soil, placing inside them photos of simple ikebana designs created using materials from Fukushima Prefecture, which suffered a nuclear disaster after the Great East Japan Earthquake. In the video of “Brise-lames” (“Wind-waves”), by choreographer Damien Jalet and French street artist and photographer JR, dancers’ bodies undulate in tortured waves. Chikuunsai IV Tanabe has woven strips of recycled bamboo into a huge organic shape that overwhelms the room in which it has been installed. In the context of Kyotographie, the work is a threatening nonhuman presence with which the viewer must negotiate the right to coexist.,And in one of the castle watchtowers, Collasse’s own photography of the March 11 disaster is presented with words from his novel “L’Ocean dans la Riziere” (“The Ocean in the Ricefield”), which also centers on the tsunami. While introducing his exhibition, Collasse humbly described himself as a lover of photography rather than an artist, but with a superbly designed installation, erected in just a few days, the total effect of viewing his images is powerfully emotive. This is representative of the strength of Kyotographie as a festival as well as its weakness, in that the beauty of the setting may blunt a work’s critical potential.,
,
,Over at the Hosoo Gallery, the Maison Europeenne de la Photographie (MEP), in conjunction with the global luxury group Kering, is presenting a selection of work by five early-career female photographers. Manon Lanjouere’s “Demande a la poussiere” (“Ask the Dust”) is a collection of faux-archive and constructed images that mixes the dramatic, poetic and forensic with particularly fine judgment. Inspired by a natural disaster and a piece of music by John Adams, Lanjouere’s work evokes a creeping sense of dread and awe that fits powerfully with the “Echo” theme. Another standout work in the MEP selection, though not a photography project, is Adele Gratacos de Volder’s combination of tiny scribbled handwriting and fever-dream video piece “Jamais Indemne! Un Coeur a Corps” (“Never Unscathed! A Heart to the Body”).,Other non-photographic works in this year’s festival include David Shrigley’s “Unconventional Bubbles,” the output from a collaboration with the Champagne maker Ruinart, and “Miroirs” (“Mirrors”) a manga by Kaiu Shirai and Posuka Demizu that is inspired by the life of fashion designer Coco Chanel.,With panels that portray, for example, a sign reading “Please do not destroy the world” and an oval Earth with the text “World has been distorted — we must return it to its original shape,” the Shrigley work chosen for display does not quite capture the esoteric and multivalent humor of the British artist. The “Miroirs” exhibition, however, is beautifully set up in a traditional obi workshop and attached storehouse from the Taisho Era (1912-26), and tells a story of grit and liberation through self-expression. Don’t expect any mention of Chanel’s Nazi sympathies, though.,
,
,In the KG+ Select satellite program, which is intended to incubate new talent, the project “Saori” by Taro Karibe, takes a nonjudgemental look at 65-year-old Senji Nakajima and his life with a silicone sex doll named Saori from 2016 to 2020. Although Nakajima is married with two children, he has lived away from home due to work since the age of 40. Karibe’s gaze is largely a sympathetic one, showing Nakajima taking care of Saori — when he takes her outside he puts her in a wheelchair — as well as enjoying her sexually as an object. According to Karibe’s accompanying text, which references the work of “Love and Sex with Robots: The Evolution of Human-Robot Relationships” author David Levy, “Saori” is underpinned by the question, “What makes us human?”,Karibe’s moral equanimity toward his subject’s situation is understandable, but in the context that the treatment of mental health issues in Japan — including loneliness — mostly focuses on ameliorating symptoms, rather than seriously engaging with causes, the question “What makes us human?” is rather sophomoric. Yusuke Takagi, another artist in the KG+ Select program, asks a harder question in his work, “Spin”: How can I break the cycle of my father’s behavior and have a better relationship with my son, more than what my father had with me?,Using old family photos, enlarged versions of his photography and colored patterns derived from CT scans that show his father’s brain atrophy brought on by chronic alcoholism, Takagi’s images owe something of their style to the postwar avant-garde of the Provoke era in Japan. His photobook of the project, however, is powerfully unique.,Catharsis is a key point in Takagi’s work, and important to the festival as a whole, particularly this year. However, photography’s superpower is to critique narratives, even if it is particularly good at creating or confirming them. Kyoto has long thrived on its narrative as being insular, and Kyotographie, simply by existing, has a major impact on that.,Kyotographie 2021: Echo is currently taking place at various locations around Kyoto until Oct. 17.

			,The New York Times,In the latest sign of the disruption underway in the art market amid the pandemic, three powerful alumni from Sotheby’s have joined forces to create a new company that will focus on the rapidly growing pool of buyers in Asia.,Amy Cappellazzo, former chair of Sotheby’s fine art division, and Yuki Terase, former head of contemporary art in Asia, in November will begin operating an international art advisory firm that handles transactions and offers market expertise, advising on the acquisition of works of art or the dissolution of collections.,
,Adam Chinn, another founding partner and Sotheby’s former chief operating officer, will handle the company’s business and legal operations.,The market for major collectors in United States is largely saturated, Cappellazzo says in a joint sit-down interview. “They have so much already that they are only buying to fill in,” she explains, “whereas when you get a whole crop of new collectors, they’re much more voracious, because they’re starting to build something.”,“The only smart thing to do,” she adds, “is to build a business that can multitask.”,The company reflects several changes in the market, namely collectors’ increasing comfort with buying art they haven’t seen in person (through online sales or from emailed PDFs) and a rising interest over the past five years among Asian buyers in purchasing works by Western artists.,During the pandemic, when people could not travel and avoided in-person activities, buyers have been forced to trust the due diligence of condition reports, catalogue raisonnes and photographic representations, Cappellazzo says.,The company, called Art Intelligence Global (AIG), will be headquartered both in Hong Kong — where Terase will be based and where the offices are to include a large exhibition space — and in New York, at the former home of the storied Pace/MacGill Gallery, where Cappellazzo and Chinn will move in early next year. (They will work remotely until then.),The equal footing of both offices reflects a recognition that, over the past five years, the Asian market has become hugely important — surpassing Europe as the second largest in the world after the United States, the team says, and fueled by young buyers from the fields of technology and entertainment in places like Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.,“Asia is really at the point where it can originate this kind of world-class success and expertise in the region, not something that’s imported from Western organizations,” Terase says. “It’s become such an important market to determine even how you structure New York sales.”,Over her decade at Sotheby’s, Terase — who previously worked in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo — helped build the Asian presence of U.S. auction houses, starting with a Hong Kong pop-up auction in fall 2016.,“That was really the first time that any international auction had offered Western art in the main auction series,” she says. “At the time, no one believed in consigning great pieces to Hong Kong — they said collectors will come and buy in London or New York.”,Earlier this month, Sotheby’s five modern and contemporary Hong Kong sales totaled $185 million, bringing the year-to-date total in those categories in Asia to $600 million, a 35% increase over 2020.,In addition, 40% of Sotheby’s last four evening sales — and nine of the top 20 pieces that sold there in 2020 — went to Asian buyers. Major collectors of Western art include Asians such as Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou.,Cappellazzo came to Sotheby’s when her advisory firm, Art Agency, Partners — managed with Allan Schwartzman, a longtime art adviser, and Chinn, an investment banker and lawyer — was acquired by the auction house in 2016.,She previously spent 13 years as chair of postwar and contemporary art development at Christie’s and began her career as an art adviser and curator.,In addition to his role at AIG, Chinn will continue as a co-chair of LiveArt, an art trading platform he helped found in June.,AIG is not the only new partnership casting an eye toward Asia. It echoes the recent merger of four prominent dealers, announced in August: Dominique Levy, Brett Gorvy, Amalia Dayan and Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn. Starting in January, their company LGDR will represent artists and organize exhibitions while also advising collectors and brokering auction sales — but attend art fairs only in Asia, where they say such gatherings remain an important gateway to a wider array of young collectors.,The AIG team, while providing a broad range of services, will advise Asian clients on promising new collecting areas, such as NFT’s — which Cappellazzo said she believes are “here to stay” — and works by artists of color, a category that has exploded.,In Hong Kong, Basquiat’s sword-brandishing “Untitled (Red Warrior)” brought about $21 million last week; in June, his triptych sold for $37.2 million; and in March, another Basquiat warrior painting brought $41.8 million, a record high price for Western art in Asia. Last week, a recent painting by Ghanaian artist Amoako Boafo, “White Hat White Shades,” sold for about $680,000, well over its estimate.,Edward Dolman, executive chair of Phillips, an auction house, says the new company made sense, given that Asia is “the fastest-growing area of the market,” and adding that to build its presence in China, Phillips recently started partnering with Poly Auction in Hong Kong.,Christie’s, for its part, is building a new headquarters in Hong Kong and has been hosting non-selling exhibitions to promote Western art in Asia. “One-third of our transactions are now with clients in Asia,” says Marc Porter, Christie’s chair, Americas. “In the same way that the art business had to expand from London and Paris, we have the same responsibility now in Asia. It’s a beginning of a trend for the century.”,Cappellazzo says she had long admired Terase, having collaborated closely with her at Sotheby’s. “There is no one I’ve worked with that talented,” Cappellazzo says, “whose art historical range is that nimble.”,The three partners’ skill sets, Chinn says, “take you from soup to nuts on any transaction.”,As to whether they would collectively eat into the business of art advisers, auction houses or art dealers, the team says their business was additive. “We’re making the pie bigger,” Chinn says. “There is so much opportunity left in the market.”,

			,Contributing writer,Situated in the city of Rueil-Malmaison, about 15 kilometers west of Paris’ city center, the picturesque Chateau de Malmaison was once home to one of France’s most famous couples: Josephine de Beauharnais and Napoleon Bonaparte.,Although the historic estate changed hands over the years, it is now a national museum dedicated to the memory of the emperor and his wife, and to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Napoleon’s death, Japanese artist Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, who goes by just her first name, was asked to create a collection of tableware inspired by the couple. Her exhibition, “Regardes de Setsuko” (“Through the Eyes of Setsuko”), ran from Oct. 26 until Nov. 15.,
,Five years before Napoleon became the emperor of France in 1804, de Beauharnais purchased the chateau and put great effort into transforming the rundown manor and surrounding 150 acres of meadows and trees into what she later described in a letter as “the most beautiful and curious garden in Europe, a model of good cultivation.”,That is why Isabelle Tamisier-Vetois, Chateau de Malmaison’s head of heritage conservation, knew that the estate’s verdant beauty had to play a key role in the anniversary celebrations. She realized that Setsuko, known for her sculptures and paintings, was the perfect artist to work with after seeing her 2018 show at Paris’ Gagosian gallery, “Into the Trees,” which featured glazed terracotta trees alongside her bronze works.,“Setsuko’s hollow trees, where life is reborn, invited us to hide and daydream,” Tamisier-Vetois says. “We were then seduced by the patinated bronze candle holders and immediately imagined collaborating with her for the museum.”,
,
,Setsuko’s past works also captivated Thierry Boutemy, a French florist known for the arrangements he created for Sofia Coppola’s 2006 drama, “Marie Antoinette.” Boutemy discovered Setsuko’s art during a trip to Switzerland, where he visited the Balthus Chapel near Setsuko’s current home and watched documentaries on the Japanese artist and her family.,“She came to Europe as a young woman and mastered an idea of beauty that transcends cultural boundaries,” says Boutemy, who traveled from his base in Belgium to offer his floral arrangements for her exhibition at Chateau de Malmaison. “You can definitely see the refinement of the two cultures in her works, but she does not enforce Japanese ideologies in an obvious way.”,On the exhibition’s opening day, a ceramic olive tree crafted by Setsuko greeted the guests at the chateau’s entrance. In the adjacent dining room, French ceramic brand Astier de Villatte, a longtime collaborator of Setsuko’s, presented dishes on a wooden dining table to complement her tableware depicting deer as a reference to de Beauharnais’ farm at the chateau and the Butard Pavillion hunting lodge in Versailles. The empress had ordered the latter to be depicted on her 1808 dining ware titled “Wild Deer Hunting in the Butard Woods.”,“Another work I created for this occasion is a decorated bowl held by the hands of Josephine,” Setsuko says. “I asked Tamisier to show me the wedding band Josephine was given by Napoleon, and it was a very modestly designed gold band, not like the big diamond rings we see today. I found that very inspiring.”,“The attraction to nature that Josephine had, her passion for botany, is easily found in Setsuko’s artworks,” Tamisier-Vetois adds.,The artist agrees that nature is an integral part of her creations. “I am constantly working with nature. I sculpt using terracotta, I paint with natural pigments and I need fire for my bronze works,” Setsuko says. “When I was studying ikebana as a young girl, I learned that it is about taking the responsibility of a flower’s life. Along with the shared ,(subtle) or ,(transient/imperfect) values of Japan and France, it’s the respect for nature I carry with me that attracts various audiences to my works.”,Her connection with the former French rulers, however, goes beyond a shared affinity for nature. In 1967, the artist and her husband, the Polish-French modern artist Balthasar Klossowski de Rola (better known as Balthus), were sent to Italy by France’s minister of cultural affairs. The pair moved to the Villa Medici, a grand residence previously owned by the Medicis that was turned into an art academy by Napoleon in 1803.,“(Villa Medici) was a French territory within Rome that was created to accommodate France’s prized painters,” Setsuko says. “My first home in Europe was this artists’ villa established by Napoleon.”,As director of the French Academy in Rome, Balthus restored the estate by dismantling its lavish 19th-century decorations and stripping down the golden walls to reveal the original handmade textures beneath. During this time, Setsuko realized that the concept of appreciating imperfection and transience existed outside of Japan as she watched Balthus strip away modern decorations to reveal the passage of time. “That’s where I learned about the global appreciation for wabi-sabi. We all find beauty in the nostalgia triggered by imperfection,” she says.,
,
,Setsuko crossed paths with Napoleon’s legacy once again many years later.,“Pierre Carron was a dear student of Balthus at Villa Medici and I’d watch Pierre’s baby, Benoit Astier de Villatte, play in the garden,” she says. “Decades later, I heard of a magnificent ceramic store called Astier de Villatte and I remembered the baby Benoit! From there, Benoit and his partner, Ivan Pericoli, took me to their rustic boutique near the Louvre, which used to be a goldsmith workshop for Napoleon’s crowns.”,Setsuko soon began working with Astier de Villatte and Pericoli, opening her ceramic studio in their Paris factory. “Their handmade ceramics are extremely fragile and are like delicate watercolor paintings,” she says.,Astier de Villatte also understands that “Japan’s concept of wabi-sabi transcends time and cultural boundaries,” Setsuko adds, noting that Japan and France share a deep bond stemming from an appreciation for the same artistic values that goes back centuries.,“It is a bond of kinship born of the same love of beauty from Japan to France that has never stopped since the Meiji Era (1868-1912),” says Setsuko, referring to Japonisme, an art movement that swept through France and influenced many Western European artists in the latter half of the 1800s.,Her recent exhibition is also a demonstration of that kinship. “The exhibition’s opening was postponed several times due to the pandemic, but the genesis of the show was to create a bridge between the past and today, and France and the world,” Tamisier-Vetois says.,With her deep understanding of the connection that Japan and France share, Setsuko has indeed created such a bridge and brought the artistic legacies of Napoleon and de Beauharnais to life.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Fortune was unfair to Tsukioka Kogyo. A gifted draftsman with an acute sense of the expressive power of color, he had talent galore. Had he been active in the first half of the 19th century, when ukiyo-e enjoyed its heyday, his work might have gained broad recognition. Alas, Kogyo was born late, in 1869, when the art form was already in decline. By the time he entered his artistic maturity in the 1890s, it was on its last legs. Today, his name is largely forgotten.,This was no fault of his own. For much of the Edo Period (1603-1868), woodblock prints had enjoyed unprecedented popularity. They were used to reproduce text and images for books, commercial advertising, playing cards, votive images and even board games. By pushing the technology to its limits, the most accomplished craftsmen were also able to produce spectacular single-sheet polychrome prints that were admired for their artistic qualities and avidly collected by enthusiasts.,
,Things began to change in the late-1850s when Japan opened its borders and gained access to Western technology. New media — photography, oil painting, magazines and newspapers — flooded in and gradually pushed aside older forms such as woodcuts. To succeed, budding artists like Kogyo needed a niche.,Kogyo chose noh. For three decades, from 1897 until his death in 1927, he produced the most comprehensive visual body of work dedicated to Japan’s oldest living form of theater. Such prints had been made before, but they were rare and often sold privately. By comparison, Kogyo designed at least 580 images that, by some estimates, amount to as much as 75% of his entire print production. In either quality or quantity, his output in the noh genre, which also includes paintings, is unparalleled.,
,
,However, few people outside of noh circles are familiar with his work, says Rei Yamauchi, a curator at the Nakagawa-machi Bato Hiroshige Museum of Art, which is located in Nasu, Tochigi Prefecture. This is partly why the museum decided to present, for the first time, all 68 prints of its Kogyo collection. This is the first such exhibition in Japan in years, perhaps even in more than a decade. The show runs until March 27.,With 45 pieces on display, the focus of the exhibition falls squarely on “One Hundred Noh Plays,” a series that Kogyo and his publisher began releasing a century ago this year. It is also considered his best and most representative. Particularly remarkable is the manner in which brush strokes are transferred onto print to preserve a painterly feel, something that is highly unusual in ukiyo-e. Dyes are delicately applied throughout, often evoking the evanescence of watercolor. In some places, they suggest shadows or foliage. In others, such as in the disheveled hair of a , or ,, two types of noh actors, they indicate envy or fury.,The visual impact is memorable, but Kogyo’s talent goes beyond aesthetic considerations. J. Thomas Rimer, an emeritus professor of Japanese literature at the University of Pittsburgh, spent much of his career studying noh. Over email, he suggests that a large part of Kogyo’s genius resided in his “ability to evoke the emotion found in the text of a particular play, through his poetic rendering of a central image chosen in order to visualize a range of emotions embedded in the play as a whole.” Kogyo could wield brush and pathos with equal dexterity.,Scholars are still unable to fully explain how and why Kogyo developed his near obsessive passion for noh. He left neither diary nor letters explaining his motives, so we are left with conjectures. But one possibility is intriguing — that Kogyo, concerned about the long-term survival of this form of theater, was trying to raise its profile and expand its appeal. The theory holds water: In the decades that followed the Meiji Restoration in 1868, it almost disappeared.,From its popular roots in the 14th century, noh evolved under the Tokugawa shogunate into a theater of the samurai and clerical elites. Together, they formed a powerful, albeit relatively small, support base. Beyond this circumscribed circle of aficionados, noh actors were seldom recognized. In this respect, they differed from their peers of the kabuki stage, many of whom were celebrated with gusto in popular fiction and ukiyo-e. “Noh actors often wore masks,” says Kendall Brown, a professor of Asian art history at California State University Long Beach, “so they did not engender the same kind of fan appreciation lavished on handsome or winsome kabuki actors.”,The shogunate had no problem with that. Although canonical versions of noh plays were widely available, their study, as well as the practice of noh chanting and dancing, was discouraged by the authorities. More importantly, performances were almost invariably held away from the gaze of commoners, in daimyo’s residences or on the shogun’s palace grounds. Only on rare occasions, say when a temple short of funds resorted to putting on a performance to fill its coffers, were the plebes able to attend.,This arrangement unraveled with the fall of the Tokugawa regime in 1867. Almost overnight, patrons vanished, funds evaporated and troupes disbanded. Many actors fell into penury while others left the profession entirely. In time, however, it dawned on the new Meiji government that noh, like opera in the West, could be helpful to shore up Japan’s cultural standing, and they began sponsoring plays. This was an important turning point. Only then, Brown explains, was “noh finally decoupled from warrior culture and prints about it could start appearing in large numbers.”,It was around that time, in 1883, when Kogyo was in his mid-teens, that he saw his first noh play, “Shakkyo.” He would illustrate it many times, including as a diptych in “One Hundred Noh Plays.” Kogyo , about his first thespian encounter, but it is likely it made quite an impression.,Kogyo began his artistic training in a traditional way. At age 12, he was sent to an uncle to study pottery painting. A few years later, he moved to a prefectural school that specialized in making crafts using glass, ceramics and stone. He remained there for three years and acquired the basic skills he needed to earn his keep.,He had become a craftsman, but he was not yet an artist. That came later, after he completed two apprenticeships: first with Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1839-92), his stepfather from 1884 and one of the most celebrated painters of the entire ukiyo-e tradition, and then with Ogata Gekko (1859-1920), from whom he received his artist’s name. Soon after, Kogyo began showing his paintings at exhibitions sponsored by the government or within trendy artistic circles. He won several prizes, but never broke out in a big way.,Decades after his death, Kogyo remains an obscure figure — but this could change. According to Yamauchi, scholars have begun reassessing the legacy of Kogyo and other early-20th-century artists. Whether this will result in greater public recognition remains to be seen, but Kogyo might not have cared anyway. What mattered to him was the survival of his beloved noh. He would be pleased to see it is alive and well.,Tsukioka Kogyo’s works will be on display until March 27 at the Nakagawa-machi Bato Hiroshige Museum of Art in Nasu, Tochigi Prefecture.

			,Bloomberg,The yen’s plunge to a five-year low shows no signs of easing as surging commodity prices have worsened the outlook for Japan’s trade balance and put pressure on the currency’s haven credentials.,The nation is a net importer of a long list of raw materials from crude oil and grains to metals, exposing it to higher costs as prices of all these have risen due to sanctions imposed on Russia over its ,. Japan posted its sixth straight monthly trade deficit in January, with the shortfall climbing to an eight-year high of ¥2.2 trillion ($18.7 billion). February numbers are due Wednesday.,
,The yen’s decline this year is even more striking given that it typically benefits in times of risk aversion. The currency has dropped against more than half of its Group of 10 peers in the past month even as the conflict in Ukraine set off a flight to safety among global investors.,""Japan relies on importing all these commodities, which are essential,” said Daisaku Ueno, chief currency strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo. ""As a fallout from the war in Ukraine, Japan is facing increased demand for dollars that’s irrelevant of risk sentiment.”,The yen is likely to drop a further 1% to 118.66 per dollar in coming months, Ueno said. That would match one of its most significant previous lows set in December 2016.,The currency headed for a sixth straight day of losses on Monday, sliding as much as half a percent to 117.88, the weakest level since January 2017.,""Momentum for dollar-yen is clearly to the upside after failing to strengthen below 114, and it can rise to 118.66 in the next one-or-two months,” said Yukio Ishizuki, a senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. in Tokyo. ""It’s difficult to see sanctions on Russia eased and commodities prices are likely to stay elevated, which puts yen at the mercy of ballooning trade deficits.”,The yen usually benefits during times of risk aversion as speculators cut back the short positions that they have built up during more positive periods. This time round though the dynamics are playing out differently.,Ironically leveraged funds started trimming their net short yen positions at exactly the wrong time, with the currency now falling to its lowest level against the greenback in more than five years.,CFTC data show short-term funds have pared their net short yen positions for the last three weeks through March 8 by 21,375 contracts to 28,343. At the end of the first week of cutting their position, on Feb. 22, dollar-yen was holding above support at its 100-DMA. Since then, not only has the pair dipped below that day’s level only once, it has rallied nearly 3% on the back of rising U.S. yields.,While the reduction in shorts may keep the yen in a range between 110 and 116 per dollar until the Ukraine situation stabilizes, the currency’s long-term direction is down and it will probably test around 120 by year-end, said Juntaro Morimoto, a currency analyst at Sony Financial Holdings Inc. in Tokyo.,""The divergence in monetary policy is putting upward pressure on the dollar-yen as a widening yield differentials will remove any yen appreciation factors after uncertainty over Ukraine clears up,” he said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS, AFP-JIJI,Dark Western “The Power of the Dog” scooped the top two honors at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, winning best film and director for Jane Campion, while sci-fi epic “Dune” picked up the most prizes.,Japanese director , snagged the award for best film not in the English language for , at the London-based event, giving the slow-burning drama an outside chance of going one better at the Oscars on March 28.,
,“That’s the power of film, they go beyond language, they go beyond borders,” Hamaguchi said as he accepted the prize. “That really is the power of film.”,New Zealand filmmaker Campion wrapped up a successful weekend for her comeback feature film, after winning the top honors at the Directors Guild of America awards in Beverly Hills the day before.,Based on the 1967 novel by Thomas Savage, the critically-acclaimed movie set on a 1920s Montana ranch marks the return of Oscar winner Campion to feature films since 2009’s “Bright Star.”,“Jane … you are a visionary whose trail blazed through the last 30 years of cinema with stories about the silenced, the under-represented and the misunderstood,” producer Tanya Seghatchian said as she accepted the award on behalf of Campion, who was absent. “You’ve inspired legions of women to find their voices. We’re here because of you.”,Campion later briefly appeared via a video call on the phone of one of the film’s producers during the winners’ press conference, and said she was “overwhelmed.”,Hosted by Australian actress and comedian Rebel Wilson, this year’s ceremony, known as the BAFTAs (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) returned as a usual glitzy red carpet event at London’s Royal Albert Hall, following a virtual event last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,There were references to the war in Ukraine, with some nominees wearing ribbons and badges in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag or speaking about the crisis on the red carpet and on stage.,“Dune,” a mammoth adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, had lead nominations with 11 nods, mainly in the creative and technical categories. It won five awards.,“Belfast,” Kenneth Brannagh’s semi-autobiographical black and white comedy drama set at the onset of Northern Ireland’s three decades of conflict, won outstanding British film.,Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” remake won two awards, including best supporting actress for Ariana DeBose.,Fresh from his win at the Screen Actors Guild awards, Troy Katsur, who is deaf, won supporting actor for “CODA,” a coming-of-age story about the only hearing member of a deaf family.,“This is a historic moment because it’s been an extremely long time for folks to really accept a different perspective of the deaf community and deaf actors,” Kotsur said on the red carpet via an interpreter. “Finally they look at me not as a deaf person, but as an artist and an actor who happens to be deaf.”,An absent Will Smith won the leading actor award for playing the father of tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams in “King Richard,” while Joanna Scanlan won leading actress for portraying a widow who discovers her late husband’s devastating secret in “After Love.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Japan has long had a love affair with the PET bottle — both full and empty.,The clear, strong and lightweight plastic outperformed aluminum, steel and glass to hold 76% of all nonalcoholic drinks in the country in 2020, according to the Japan Soft Drinks Association (JSDA). And, thanks to a proactive industry, stringent laws and compliant consumers, Japan was among the top countries in the world for PET bottle collection in 2021, at 93%, and recycling, at 89%, according to the Council for PET Bottle Recycling.,
,Still, growing environmental awareness has put the consumption of single-use plastic under a harsh spotlight. Even with steps to reduce the volume of fossil fuel-derived PET required for new bottles, there remain calls for more to be done.,Forty years on since the introduction of this packaging for soft drinks, how and why has PET bottle consumption and processing in Japan changed and what does the future hold?,
,
,Patented in 1973, the PET bottle was invented by Nathaniel Wyeth, an American mechanical engineer and inventor. Building on the work of colleagues who created PET in 1941, Wyeth’s variant of polyethylene terephthalate could withstand the pressure of carbonated liquids while still being lighter than glass and virtually unbreakable.,Japan first adopted the material in 1977 for packaging soy sauce until a revision to the container and packaging standards in the Food Sanitation Act allowed its use to be expanded to beverages in February 1982. In the same year, the first heat-resistant PET bottle was developed in Japan and the Japan PET Bottle Association was established.,At first, liquids were limited to fruit juice, closely followed by varieties of tea. Use for liquor, of which most was ,, was permitted in 1985.,Bottle size was restricted by the industry to 1 liter or more to curb waste (as bottles were largely incinerated in those days) but consumer demand for smaller containers and the introduction of PET bottle recycling in the 1990s ushered in the release of 500-milliliter bottles in 1996.,As part of efforts to support the recycling process, beverage and PET bottle manufacturing companies published Industry Voluntary Design Guidelines in 1992. Under the recommendations, bottles were to be clear and made solely of PET, with no direct printing on them; caps were to be made only of plastic and labels were to be easily removable by hand.,
,
,Shunichi Nasu, general manager of the business planning division at the JSDA, says the “foresight” and “great decisions” of the industry leaders who made those guidelines has helped Japan far exceed the PET bottle recycling rate of the European Union (58%) and the United States (28%).,However, the JSDA, whose industry members collaborate on common, noncompetitive issues such as recycling, wants to do more. It is working toward 100% collection, which would increase the recycling rate even further. One key way to achieve this is by reducing contamination of bottles before collection.,Of the 665,000 tons of PET bottles collected in 2019, 46% were picked up by municipalities and 54% came from the “business route,” which includes factories, offices, schools and recycling boxes at vending machines.,
,
,Today, PET from homes is predominantly clean (rinsed, with cap and label removed), unlike many collections from the business route. Large organizations also perform well, while buildings shared by numerous small and midsized enterprises tend to have less sorted recycling, says Nasu. Street collections fare worst.,In 2020, more than 30% of the content in recycling boxes by vending machines in the Tokyo area were non-PET, namely tobacco packaging (28%), alcohol containers (22%) and daily living waste (19%).,The problem also extends to the rest of Japan. According to Miho Hayashi of the Kanagawa Prefecture-based IGES Centre Collaborating with UNEP on Environmental Technologies, the disposal of non-PET waste in bins located next to vending machines is “a challenge for increasing recycling” that has prompted many companies to consider “how to modify the design of such bins so that only PET bottles can be disposed of.”,Contamination renders PET bottle recycling expensive and difficult at best, and inefficient or impossible at worst. An estimated 30% of the PET bottles collected in Japan are exported, largely because they are too dirty to be used, Nasu says. If contaminants can be reduced or removed from bottles collected through the business route, there is a greater chance that more PET recycling can be done domestically.,Collecting as much clean PET as possible is vital to promote “bottle-to-bottle” recycling and make it more competitive, says Hayashi. This form of horizontal recycling “can reduce or even avoid the use of virgin resin, a material derived from fossil fuels” by using “material and chemical recycling to allow PET bottles to be reborn as new PET bottles.” The closed loop results in a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide compared to creating new PET from fossil-based resources.,At present, only 15.7% of PET bottles in Japan are produced by horizontal recycling. Most undergo downcycling, as their constituent materials are transformed into textiles or low-quality plastics. Although better than not recycling, once this process begins, recycling becomes harder and, ultimately, no longer possible.,
,
,Recognizing these limitations, the JSDA declared in April 2021 that its members would achieve 50% bottle-to-bottle recycling by 2030. Although Nasu admits “there is a big journey ahead,” he is confident the promise of “clean” PET will convince consumers to support the cause.,The JSDA is trialing a new kind of recycling box by vending machines. It features an enforced lid to make it difficult to open by consumers and a smaller, less visible opening to prevent it being used for trash. In line with education efforts, the box is orange — the same color as the branding for the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities — and labels convey key messages detailing the box’s target refuse.,
,
,Several large Japanese soft drink manufacturers are also appealing to consumers to dispose of PET bottles at work, in train stations and on the street as carefully as they do at home.,In December 2020, Ito-en placed what it called a “Tsubuseru Recycling Box” in Shibuya to raise awareness of its bottle-to-bottle efforts. The transparent bin was fitted with technology to compress each PET bottle in 20 seconds. In an on-site survey, less than half of passersby said they understood the meaning of bottle-to-bottle recycling.,“Among those who throw away non-PET in recycling boxes, many think they are doing right by not littering, so we wanted to see if bottle-to-bottle awareness would change their view,” says company spokesperson Aichiro Yamaguchi. “Through our efforts we were able to confirm that the box is interesting and leads to proper sorting and understanding.”,Similarly, the Kirin Group and Lawson teamed up in 2021 to promote bottle-to-bottle recycling by placing new PET bottle collection machines outside Lawson stores. On the outer panel, users were asked to wash their bottles and remove labels and caps before feeding them into the machine to be crushed. As an incentive, users received one Lawson Ponta point for every five bottles inserted. If the data is promising, the pair plan to roll out the scheme to more stores this year.,Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Suntory says its new logo, launched this month, , (“Bottles are resources! Towards a Sustainable Bottle”), will strengthen its communication to consumers on horizontal recycling. The company recorded a bottle-to-bottle recycling rate of 37% in 2021 and aims to use recycled PET materials for more than half of its total plastic bottle weight in Japan by 2025.,

,With the drive to gather more clean PET, Hideo Akabane, vice-chief secretariat of The Council for PET Bottle Recycling, says “further significant growth can be expected (in bottle-to-bottle recycling) as multiple new production plants will be launched in the future.”,Companies are also exploring new ways to reduce the amount of PET required to make bottles. Since these efforts began in 2004, manufacturers have reduced the weight of an average PET bottle by 25%, equating to savings of 185,200 tons in 2019, according to The Council for PET Bottle Recycling.,Suntory claims its 550-milliliter Tennensui water bottle is the lightest in Japan at a mere 11.9 grams. It uses 30% plant-based materials, which means 40% fewer petroleum-derived ingredients are used per bottle. Asahi Soft Drinks’ Mitsuya Cider bottles are also 27% lighter than they were in 2004.,Recently developed technologies utilizing nitrogen and pressurization have also led to more lightweight, heat-resistant bottles.,
,
,Ensuring PET bottles keep their shape and that any carbonated drink inside has an adequate shelf life are the biggest obstacles to making bottles lighter, according to Nasu.,“We can’t reduce the amount of plastic used as quickly as we have done in the past 20 years, and we’re now in a place where it’s difficult to reduce more, but we’re still looking for opportunities,” he says.,One new growth area for plastic reduction is in online bulk sales of soft drinks. Following an amendment to the law in 2020, companies are able to forgo labels on individual PET bottles provided the necessary product information is printed on the box, thereby placing consumers one step closer to “clean” PET.,Under this system, Asahi Soft Drinks offers label-free bottled water, ready-to- drink tea and yogurt beverages, while Coca-Cola Co.’s I Lohas bottle sports an embossed logo.,The pandemic-induced uptick in online shopping is expected to stimulate ongoing demand, according to GlobalData’s Market Pulse Survey, which found almost one-third of consumers intend to maintain or increase their bulk soft drink purchasing habits.,
,
,The future offers further opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of the PET bottle. The Coca-Cola Co. offered a taste in October 2021 with the launch of its first bottle made entirely from plant-based packaging. The technology used to create the PlantBottle “signals a step-change in the commercial viability of the biomaterial,” according to a company statement.,Nevertheless, grassroots campaigns to reduce or eliminate PET bottle usage and promote more sustainable lifestyles have sprung up in Japan in recent years. Nonprofit organization Mymizu, for example, provides a water refill app that allows users to access free water on the go — from shops, cafes and other sites — so they don’t need to buy bottled water.,Despite the growing number of alternatives, the soft drinks industry remains confident that PET will continue to be Japan’s container of choice for years to come.,“We gave consumers options — cans, glass, PET — and they liked PET, so our responsibility is to provide a continuous supply,” says Nasu, who touts the JSDA’s stance that PET bottles can do more good than harm in the long run. “I want a future where consumers think empty PET bottles are not garbage, but resources to help the Earth.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,For years, bitcoin buffs who were questioned by skeptics about the value of the cryptocurrency would respond by saying: Just wait.,Wait until inflation hits, and people look to park their savings in a stable digital asset that won’t lose its value. Wait until war breaks out, and authoritarians start seizing assets and imposing capital controls on their citizens. Wait until big banks and tech companies start censoring dissidents for their political views. Then you’ll see why we need a stateless, decentralized, anonymous digital currency.,
,More than most cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was seen by many of its libertarian-leaning fans as a kind of doomsday insurance, a form of “digital gold” that would be a source of stability as the world grew more chaotic and unpredictable.,Well, chaos is here. In the United States, inflation is rising at the fastest pace in decades, and the VIX — the so-called fear index used by Wall Street to measure expected volatility in the stock market — has risen more than 80% this year. Last month, Canada’s government responded to the threat of a protest convoy of anti-vaccine truckers by threatening to freeze their bank accounts, drawing calls for a type of money that isn’t subject to government seizures. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was met with brutal sanctions that have tanked the ruble and devastated the Russian economy, and many U.S. companies have pulled out of Russia, making it nearly impossible for its citizens to access their bank accounts, use credit cards or even post on social media.,In other words, this is a perfect storm of economic and geopolitical events that should, theoretically, be great for bitcoin.,But bitcoin hasn’t boomed. In fact, even as Wall Street analysts contemplate the possibility of nuclear Armageddon, crypto prices have fallen steadily. Bitcoin prices are down 10% in the past month, and Ether, the second most popular crypto coin, is down roughly 15%.,Day-to-day usage of cryptocurrencies isn’t picking up the way you’d expect, either. Bitcoin trading volume rose after Russia invaded Ukraine, but it has remained relatively flat since, suggesting that people aren’t rushing to trade their rubles and hryvnia (Ukraine’s currency) for digital currencies. Russian oligarchs don’t appear to be using crypto to evade sanctions en masse, either, despite initial fears that they might.,Granted, crypto has not been totally absent from these events. In Canada, some truckers raised money through crypto donations (while others had their crypto wallets seized as part of the crackdown), and Ukraine’s government has reportedly raised nearly $100 million in crypto donations. And it’s still too early to say, with certainty, that crypto won’t be useful in later stages of the Russian conflict.,But bitcoin doesn’t seem to be playing a central role in our global unraveling so far. Which raises the obvious question: Why not?,One possibility is that crypto is still too confusing and too difficult for normal people to use, especially during a war. Internet access is spotty in many parts of Ukraine, and reports have suggested that even the country’s elites are struggling to convert their assets into crypto.,Another possibility, popular among skeptics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is that bitcoin is still too volatile to be useful as a hedge against economic and political instability.,“The bitcoin and crypto communities have been selling a false narrative all these years that bitcoin is supposed to be a safe haven from the traditional financial markets,” said Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association, a cryptocurrency trade group. (His group promotes a bitcoin spinoff, Bitcoin SV, that sees itself as a more useful version of the cryptocurrency.),Bitcoin is doomed, Nguyen argues, because it can be slow and expensive to process transactions, making it less useful for paying for things. “And so a lot of bitcoin supporters have had to come up with this argument that it’s meant to be a reserve asset,” he said.,Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, floated a different theory. Bitcoin’s earliest and most vocal adopters, he said, tended to be libertarians who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of insurance policy against hyperinflation and government corruption. But the more recent price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments and cared less about their political implications.,“There’s a tremendous amount of rhetoric around bitcoin in particular that suggests that it’s predominantly a means of escaping from the government-issued fiat currency system,” he said. “And yet most of the activity, according to basically every rigorous study that’s been done, is predominantly people speculating.”,Another possible explanation for bitcoin’s underperformance, which was floated by Joe Weisenthal at Bloomberg, is that chaos cuts both ways and that the same events that could be seen as “good for bitcoin” in the short term — inflation, sanctions, geopolitical conflict — could also be bad for bitcoin over the long term, since they could draw the attention of regulators.,“To whatever extent the Canadian trucker story would be seen as bullish for bitcoin (because it got people thinking about ways of making payments without regulated entities) it’s also bearish for bitcoin (because it caught the attention of state actors who wanted to push back against such payments),” he wrote.,There are other explanations out there, too. Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive of crypto exchange FTX, said on Twitter that while he thought bitcoin would “do better” in a less stable political and economic environment, he guessed that the discrepancy was partially related to the media’s negative coverage of crypto.,“Headlines have been largely negative independent of actual content the last month in a reaction to statements from the industry, which I think has posed significant headwinds,” he wrote.,But perhaps the most interesting view of crypto’s usefulness during unstable times comes straight from Ukraine’s government.,On Tuesday, I posed a question about crypto to Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. Since the Russian invasion, Bornyakov and his team — led by the country’s digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov — have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for Ukraine’s army. Tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses, and the money has been used to buy military supplies, including bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles.,Bornyakov, who was speaking from an undisclosed location in Ukraine on a videoconference hosted by artificial intelligence company Collective[i], said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed.,“In a situation like this, where the national bank is not fully operating, crypto is helping to perform fast transfers, to make it very quick and get results almost immediately,” he said.,But Bornyakov seemed wary of overstating crypto’s importance to the Ukrainian cause.,“I don’t think crypto is playing a major part,” Bornyakov said. “But its role is essential in this conflict in terms of helping our army.”,

			,AFP-jiji,Russians were relishing their final moments scrolling through Instagram on Sunday, while bloggers and small businesses that rely heavily on the platform scrambled to lure followers elsewhere online.,Moscow announced this week that access to the social network would cease, accusing Instagram’s parent company Meta of turning a blind eye to calls for violence against Russians.,
,In a farewell post, reality TV star Olga Buzova — who has racked up the second-largest audience in Russia with 23 million followers — was in despair and disbelief.,“Right now, I’m writing this post and crying,” she wrote, annotating the text with a crying emoji. “I hope this isn’t true.”,Fashion blogger Karina Nigay, who meanwhile boasts nearly 3 million followers, was still processing the fact of the looming ban.,“I’m in a state of resentment and nowhere near a state of acceptance,” she said.,The move comes as part of long-running efforts by President Vladimir Putin to rein in control of what Russians can and cannot access on the internet.,These efforts have quickened to a dizzying pace since he announced Russia’s sweeping military incursion in Ukraine and as authorities work to control how the conflict is seen at home.,Russia’s media regulator Roskomnadzor said this week that Instagram was being taken down for allowing posts urging violence against Russians.,But the official website Gosuslugi, which hosts government services, said Instagram would be pulled beginning March 14 citing Russians’ “psychological health” and efforts to protect children from “bullying and insults.”,Gosuslugi also recommended that Russians return to homegrown platforms that were abandoned as Instagram and Faceook’s popularity ballooned.,
,Many bloggers said on Instagram they would pivot to VK, Russia’s equivalent of Facebook.,It is closest among Russian social media platforms to Instagram in its features but has also been accused of cozying up to authorities.,Russians have also been turning to Telegram, a network already hugely popular in Russia and across former Soviet countries, which Moscow several years ago tried — and ultimately failed — to block.,The app was created to be a messaging service but also hosts channels where users can post photos and videos with accompanying texts.,Forty-one-year-old painter Alexei Garkusha said in Saint Petersburg that he would be among those turning to Telegram.,It’s “more interesting,” he said, sounding less concerned about Instagram’s fate.,“If they shut it down, they shut it down!” Garkusha shrugged.,In farewell posts, bloggers lamented the need to rebuild their following and businesses, at a time when the economy is struggling under Western sanctions.,“Many, ironically, say that bloggers will finally get over their dependency on easy money,” said Alexandra Mitroshina, a popular user known for instructing others how to monetize their following.,“But don’t forget that half of our small and medium businesses are linked to Instagram and Whatsapp,” she told her 2 million followers.,For many small Russian businesses, Instagram was a primary platform for advertising, processing sales and communicating with clients.,But former reality TV star, Buzova, was among those optimistic her work could continue on other platforms and urged followers to join her on VK.,“Of course it will be difficult and unusual but we are strong together,” she wrote.,Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri has said the platform has 80 million users in Russia.,On the streets of Russia’s former, imperial capital, Saint Petersburg, some people said the ban was a pity, but was not the end of the world.,“I don’t think anything globally catastrophic will happen,” said Yelena Teleginskaya, 31.,Others were pleased to see the back of it, like engineer Nikolay Yeremenko, 45.,“If they closed it, it’s for the best. We’ll live without it.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bloomberg,China placed the 17.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen into lockdown for at least a week, seeking to halt a growing COVID-19 outbreak with a move that could cause disruption and production delays in the key technology hub and port.,The lockdown, which came after virus cases doubled nationwide to nearly 3,400, will be accompanied by three rounds of city-wide mass testing, according to a government notice. The measure, announced Sunday, followed earlier restrictions placed on Shenzhen’s central business district, and will last until March 20.,
,All bus and subway systems were shut, and businesses, except those providing essential services, have been closed. Employees were told to work from home if they can. Residents will be barred from leaving the city except in limited situations.,Shenzhen is home to the headquarters of tech giants Huawei Technologies Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., as well as the key manufacturing facility of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. — Apple Inc.’s main maker of the iPhone and other products. It is also one of China’s busiest ports.,The surge in infections in the city is thought to be linked to an ,, where about 300,000 people are currently in isolation or under home quarantine. A , has also seen most schools returned to online learning and travel into the city restricted. Bus services from other provinces were halted, and China’s aviation regulator is in discussions with airlines about diverting all international flights into the financial center, Bloomberg News reported Friday.,Growing clusters spawned by the highly infectious omicron variant in China’s most developed large cities and economic powerhouses have turned into an unprecedented challenge for the country’s “COVID zero” strategy.,The policy, which saw China virus free for long periods and with one of the lowest death rates among major economies, is leaving the country increasingly isolated as other parts of the world open up and start to live with the virus. Until now, officials had largely resisted more hardcore measures such as lockdowns in China’s biggest cities and relied more on targeted responses, only to see omicron continue to spread.,
,COVID zero tactics have led to disruption in other cities, with multiple rounds of mass testing in Tianjin in January halting production at a Toyota Motor Corp. plant and other factories there for more than a week. The approach will make it harder for Beijing to hit its economic growth target in 2022, as the costs of the measures rise, Nomura Holdings Inc. says. Still, China reiterated its commitment to COVID zero on Friday, with top health official Ma Xiaowei saying strict controls needed to be kept in place and that officials should avoid “war-weariness” in their work.,Changchun, a city of some 9 million people in China’s northeast, was locked down on Friday, with residents there also to be mass tested. Reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, authorities are moving quickly to build makeshift hospitals there and in the eastern port city of Qingdao. China isolates all positive virus cases, regardless of severity, to prevent spread.,
,
,The COVID-19 surge in Hong Kong has provided an unprecedented challenge to Beijing, with the city’s tight border controls and weeks-long quarantines no match for omicron once it entered the city. Thousands of people left the Asian financial hub to return to the mainland, with Shenzhen and Shanghai some of the busiest entry ports.,Shanghai Disneyland will operate at controlled capacity and will require visitors to present negative COVID-19 test results from within 24 hours of entering the amusement park.,Hong Kong’s health system and morgues have been under pressure from the record outbreak that’s pushed its death rate to one of the highest in the world. While the virus case count in the city appears to have plateaued over the past week, fatalities have risen, especially among the elderly, which had some of the lowest vaccination rates despite their greater vulnerability.,The Hong Kong government is still formulating plans for the mandatory testing of all its residents, including timing and how they’ll ensure essential operations can continue if movement restrictions were to be imposed, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Wednesday. For now, authorities will focus on vaccinating older people living at care facilities — which are seeing a surge in fatalities — and increase the number of hospital beds to treat patients, she has said.,Also an adherent of COVID zero, Hong Kong has laid the limits of the strategy bare with authorities scrambling once omicron got through the tough border defenses. There seems to have been little planning for if the virus flared meaningfully in the city, resulting in scenes eerily similar to those seen in the early days of the pandemic in parts of Italy and the U.S. Hong Kong’s density and political climate makes it difficult to lock down, and despite pressure from Beijing officials have so far resisted calling one.,While China is publicly still committed to eliminating COVID-19, there are signs the country’s health officials and experts are at least considering how they may exit the approach and live with the virus as endemic.,China approved the antiviral pill Paxlovid developed by Pfizer Inc. last month, a move seen by many as evidence of that planning. The introduction of rapid antigen tests on Friday may also be a sign, with other countries shifting toward use of at-home tests when their lab testing systems were overwhelmed by broader circulation of the virus.,That said, any shift will be slow and unlikely to occur before 2023, given the need for stability in a politically important year for President Xi Jinping, people familiar with China’s thinking have told Bloomberg.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,staff writer,Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday that the government will consider establishing a new police unit in charge of protecting the nation’s nuclear power plants.,""Now that the public is becoming increasingly concerned about nuclear power plant safety, I would like to discuss the possibility of deploying a dedicated nuclear power plant special security force across the nation,” Kishida said during an Upper House Budget Committee meeting.,
,The prime minister's remark comes in the wake of Russia’s attack in early March on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in which Russian forces fired heavy weapons in the direction of the plant’s reactors. In addition to occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian troops also control the Chernyobyl plant, which has been nonoperational since a 1986 accident resulted in a core meltdown. A third Ukrainian plant, Yuzhnoukrainsk, is also at risk, with reports last week indicating that Russian troops were about 30 kilometers away.,Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian nuclear power plants prompted reflection in Japan about the vulnerability of its own nuclear power fleet. On Tuesday, Fukui Gov. Tatsuji Sugimoto called for the deployment of the Self-Defense Forces near the prefecture’s 15 reactors, including both those that are operational and those scheduled for or undergoing decommissioning.,Fukui Prefecture has the largest number of nuclear reactors in the country.,“Reactors should never be attacked, but to prepare for such a contingency, I urge the Defense Ministry to set up SDF bases to halt such attacks,” Sugimoto said when presenting his request to Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi.,Kishida, however, indicated that he wants to discuss strengthening nuclear power plant security through the expansion of the specialized police unit that guards the Fukui plants, not the SDF. In Fukui, the Nuclear Facility Security Unit is exclusively tasked with guarding nuclear power plants.,
,
,At Monday’s Upper House budget meeting, Kenichi Sakurazawa, director general of the National Police Agency's Security Bureau, said it was his intention to strengthen security at nuclear power plants throughout Japan following the Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia.,Sakurazawa said that the current security system in Fukui consists of an armed security force on alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. He explained that special security units equipped with automatic rifles and specialized vehicles are also stationed at nuclear power plants outside Fukui.,Opposition parties, however, are calling for a fixed unit to be established, as the current system means riot police members are transferred out on a rotating basis for a fixed term.,The vulnerability of nuclear reactors to attack has long been a concern in the prefectures that host them. In December, a nationwide association of local towns and villages hosting nuclear power plants issued a call for a legal structure establishing no-fly zones over nuclear power plants and for setting a minimum altitude for flying in their vicinity.,The association also sought stronger cooperation between the SDF, police, the Japan Coast Guard and related authorities to strengthen the defense of nuclear plants from missile attacks and terrorists.,That request came after the National Governors’ Association met in June and issued a similar call for no-fly zones above the plants and a minimum altitude for aircraft in a plant’s vicinity.,
,
,On March 4, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said that if a nuclear power plant in Japan is attacked by a missile from another country, it will be intercepted by missiles.,""We will respond with a multilayered defense that combines an intercept at the upper level by the Maritime Self-Defense Force's SM3-equipped Aegis ships and an intercept at the lower level by the Air Self-Defense Force's PAC-3 missiles,"" he said, referring to surface-to-air missile systems.,Shigeru Handa, a defense writer and adjunct professor at Dokkyo University and Hosei University, said Matsuno’s answer was limited to what is possible in terms of defense when Aegis destroyers and PAC-3 missiles are pre-deployed in case of an attack on a nuclear power plant.,“Constitutionally, there is no problem with the SDF guarding nuclear power plants. However, the Self-Defense Forces Law limits the scope of SDF protection to U.S. military facilities and SDF facilities. Revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law is necessary to protect nuclear power plants,” he said.,As of Feb. 28, Japan had 60 nuclear power plants, spread across 13 of the nation's 47 prefecture, Of those, 24 were being decommissioned, 10 were officially in operation and seven had been approved for restart. Another 10 were undergoing safety inspections, and the nine remaining reactors had not applied for a restart.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,“Intimate Stranger” represents something of a comeback for its star, Asuka Kurosawa, and a return for its director, Mayu Nakamura. Though long in demand as a supporting actor in TV dramas and films, Kurosawa is playing her first leading role in two decades, following her breakout star turn in Shinya Tsukamoto’s 2002 cult hit “A Snake of June.”,Meanwhile, Nakamura, who made her feature debut with the 2006 youth drama “The Summer of Stickleback,” has spent much of her time since making documentaries, including her 2019 film about political activist Kunio Suzuki.,
,“Intimate Stranger,” which premiered in the Nippon Cinema Now section at last year’s Tokyo International Film Festival and is showing in select theaters throughout Japan, tells the story of Megumi (Kurosawa), a middle-aged woman whose search for her missing teenage son leads her into a strangely close relationship with a young con artist, Yuji (Fuju Kamio), who claims to know the lost boy.,The film had a long gestation, with Nakamura writing an early version of the script about the time she directed “The Summer of Stickleback.” ”A lot of things have changed since then,” she says in a joint interview with Kurosawa. “When the film finally took shape, the coronavirus was spreading, so we decided to change the setting to (take place during) the pandemic.”,In addition to making extensive script rewrites, Nakamura spent a long time searching for her lead. “It was not a role that just anyone could play,” she says. Her quest led her to Kurosawa, after viewing the actor’s work in not only “A Snake of June,” in which she plays a telephone counselor who is sexually harassed by a stalker, but also Sion Sono’s dark thriller “Cold Fish” (2010) and Takahisa Zeze’s “Sanctuary” (2006). In particular, Kurosawa’s portrayal of a mother searching for her lost child in “Sanctuary” resonated with Nakamura.,“In that film, Ms. Kurosawa had many different faces: erotic, scary, a normal woman, a mother,” the director says. “In France, there are people like Isabelle Huppert and Juliette Binoche who can play many different roles, but in Japan, there are very few like that.” And Kurosawa, she found, was one of them.,In approaching the role, Kurosawa says that she did not find it difficult to enter the mindset of Megumi, a woman who has lost both her grown son and, much earlier, her 3-month-old baby. “I myself am a mother of three children, so I could understand the emotions of a woman whose child had died a few months after birth, and whose love for it had become warped because of that tragedy,” she explains.,“However, her dubious behavior was not clear to me, and I found it difficult to understand,” she adds. “As an actress, I thought it would be better if I didn’t try to play Megumi by identifying with her. Instead, I approached the role as if I were someone who could be close to her … say, a friend.”,
,
,While shaping Megumi as a character whose motivations are not easily understood, Nakamura also wrote an ambiguous ending that chills but doesn’t explain. “I left (the ending) up to the imagination of the audience,” she says. “Depending on the viewer, the interpretation is completely different.”,Among Nakamura’s models for the film were two psychological horrors: Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s “Retribution” (2006) and Roman Polanski’s “Repulsion” (1965). “I told everyone that I was aiming for film noir, not horror, but when I said that to people in Japan, they were like, ‘Huh?’” she says with a laugh.,Working with veteran cinematographer Tomohiko Tsuji, Nakamura shot the film in what she describes as a “normal fashion,” but in post-production she used bleach bypass, a film processing method that desaturates colors to achieve a black-and-white look. Invented by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa for the 1960 Kon Ichikawa film “Her Brother,” the method creates a feeling of being in interior spaces that, in their ghostly paleness, unsettles the viewer in “Intimate Stranger.”,The feature, with its stylization and hidden depths, is quite unlike Nakamura’s documentaries, which are the products of dogged reporting, not artfully filmed introspection. “I originally got into films because I wanted to do fiction, but I had a lot of trouble raising money,” she says. “But with a documentary, I could do it on my own.” That experience, however, proved useful in making “Intimate Stranger.” “When the pandemic happened, I wanted to incorporate it into the film, to shoot what was happening now,” she says. “My documentary background helped me to do that.”,The film, Kurosawa says, “is the only one of its kind, and only (Nakamura) could direct it this way. I don’t think any other director, male or female, could have done it. It’s unique.”,One thing that sets the story apart from other domestic dramas is the eroticized relationship that develops between Megumi and Yuji. As his stay at Megumi’s apartment lengthens, Yuji becomes a kind of surrogate son to the bereft woman. But before shaving Yuji with a straight razor — a method she insists on despite his initial queasiness — Megumi lathers his face with a touch like that of a lover, not a mother. But when she presses the blade to his throat, her expression suggests that, angered by his deceptions, she is debating whether to slit it. “When men get shaved by a barber there’s a fine line between fear and pleasure,” Nakamura says. “I thought that was interesting.”,Also intriguing to the director were the strong bonds between mothers and sons in Japan that struck her as exceptional when she returned to Japan after living in the United States and the United Kingdom for 14 years. “Compared to other countries, (in Japan, that bond) is very close, with the mother treating her son like a lover,” she says. “Of course, it depends on the person.”,Also different from the West, she adds, is the prevalence here of the “,” (“it’s me, it’s me”) scam, in which a fraudster impersonates a mark’s son over the phone to extract cash for a supposed emergency. Yuji and his associates run such schemes in the film. “In the U.S. and Europe, when a grown son comes crying to his parents for a big sum of money, they’d hang up on him,” Nakamura says. “They’d say ‘Are you kidding?’ And in Japan, it’s always the son, never the daughter, who’s asking for the money. After being abroad for a long time, I thought of that as a symbol of Japanese society.”,As Megumi, Kurosawa adds layers that are darker and more terrifying than the “gullible mother” stereotype. “Intimate Stranger” may be a pandemic movie, but the feelings of grief and loneliness that Kurosawa portrays so brilliantly are timeless, universal and, in Megumi’s case, endless.,“Intimate Stranger” is showing now at Euro Space in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo. It will be screened in cinemas nationwide at later dates.

			,Contributing writer,Slides of family trips from long ago sit in many a drawer or box, little seen as the technology for making and showing them fades into the past.,But John Junkerman, a Tokyo-based documentary filmmaker, went beyond preserving the color slide photos his father took of their family’s stay in early postwar Hayama, a seaside town on the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture. Last December, he released the photographs in a book, “Hayama 1952-1953 Charles Junkerman,” published by Yobisha. Junkerman’s introduction and captions are in both Japanese and English.,
,
,Though an amateur with no formal training in photography, Junkerman’s father, Charles, took hundreds of photos with his Nikon camera and Kodachrome color slide film, both then unobtainable luxuries for ordinary Japanese. The film could not be processed in Japan, so Charles had to send it to the United States.,More than being rare color glimpses of a vanished world, the book’s 270 photos reveal a keen, sympathetic eye for their subjects, beginning with Junkerman and his two older siblings. But while photographing his children frolicking on the beach in Hayama, then known as a summer retreat for well-off Tokyoites, Charles’ interest extended to the local kids, fishermen and farmers. His photos form a fascinating ethnographic study of Hayama society, from its workaday life to its games and festivals, only seven years after the end of World War II.,Born in 1952, Junkerman was an infant during his family’s Japan sojourn and has no memories of it, but seeing the slides as a boy was special for him, as well as for everyone in the family.,
,
,“My parents really fell in love with Japan,” he says in an interview with The Japan Times. “They were young, in their 20s, and when they first went to Japan, it was their first time overseas. It was a very special experience for them. Everything was new and exciting and interesting.”,Then a U.S. Navy lieutenant and physician posted to a naval hospital in nearby Yokosuka, Charles used his off-duty hours to explore his Hayama neighborhood and Japanese culture — he and his wife, Anne, amassed a collection of Japanese prints and lacquerware.,“We lived a three-minute walk from the beach,” Junkerman says. “So they got to know the fishermen. Then my father bought a car and drove between Hayama and Yokosuka, which was a 20-minute drive over the mountains, every day to work. He would stop along the way and take photographs of farmers planting and harvesting rice.”,With Yokosuka and the surrounding area spared from bombing during the war, what Charles was seeing through his lens “was really prewar Japan, when people were primarily engaged in agriculture,” Junkerman says. Also, compared to many urban Japanese, who had suffered through food shortages after the war, Hayama’s fishermen and farmers were “relatively well off and able to sustain themselves. So there’s a sense of peacefulness (in the photos), a sense of being able to make ends meet.”,After Anne died in 2010, followed by Charles in 2014, Junkerman inherited the slides. “They always were very much implanted in my brain,” he says. “I’ve often talked about how my connection to Japan really has its roots in those slides.” Hearing his stories about his father’s photos, an NHK producer told him that people in Hayama would be interested in seeing them. The producer then contacted an NPO in Hayama about arranging a small exhibition.,
,
,Held in 2014 at a local library, the exhibition garnered positive responses from the public. “The people who came were saying that these are very rare photographs — especially photographers. There are quite a few photographers living in Hayama, and they just raved about the photographs,” Junkerman says.,One reason is that because they were taken with Kodachrome film, the images had held their colors better than photos made using later processes.,“With Kodachrome the pigment isn’t contained in the film, but in the developing bath,” Junkerman says. “It’s an additive process. So you end up with a very thick positive (image), whereas with other kinds of color film it’s a subtractive process and you get a thin image that fades over time. But even after 70 years, Kodachrome still looks vivid. (My father’s photos) look as fresh as if they were taken yesterday.”,Mitsuru Okada, the head of local publisher Yobisha, was also impressed by the photos when he attended the exhibition. Soon after, he and Junkerman began compiling the photos for publication, which resulted in “Hayama 1952-1953 Charles Junkerman.”,“It’s very gratifying to have the book and to be able to share the photos,” Junkerman says.,While Hayama has changed in the decades since the Junkerman family called the town home, the Western-style house in which they lived still stands. “My parents were lucky to find it,” Junkerman says of the dwelling, which was the one-time summer residence of former Prime Minister Taro Katsura. “By Japanese standards, it was a very grand summer home. Though by American standards, it was fairly average.”,Also, descendants of Charles’ subjects and even some of the subjects themselves are still living in the Hayama area. Together with veteran photographer and Hayama resident Bruce Osborn, Junkerman has started a project to locate them.,“Of course, the only people still alive were children at that time,” he says. “We know of one who grew up in that area. He and his brother still run the local liquor store. He identified himself in the book after it was published. He remembers some of the others so we should be able to track down a number of them.” Osborn plans to take new photographs to complement the ones Junkerman’s father shot seven decades ago.,Charles continued to take photographs in the 40 places around the world where he and Anne lived after leaving Japan: “He was a quiet man,” Junkerman says of his father. “His way of interacting with the world was through the lens of a camera.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Japan has been fortunate in the distinction of its visiting writers. Many, including the likes of Rudyard Kipling, Edmund Blunden, Marguerite Yourcenar and Angela Carter, published memorable works inspired by their stays here. One figure who continues to enjoy affection among Japanophiles is Yorkshire-born travel writer and explorer Isabella Bird (1831-1904).,
,In the latter half of the 19th century, Bird was among a slowly emerging breed of women exiting the confines of the Victorian parlor, stepping through the garden gate and boarding steamers to distant lands. She was already an accomplished writer and seasoned traveler when she arrived in Tokyo in 1878, having explored the far reaches of the globe, traversing from the volcanoes of Hawaii to the Rocky Mountains of North America. Her ambitious trajectories are studied in meticulous detail by Kiyonori Kanasaka, author of “Isabella Bird and Japan: A Reassessment” and “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan: Revisiting Isabella Bird.”,
,An emeritus professor of Kyoto University and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Kanasaka is regarded as one of the world’s foremost scholars on Bird. When asked about his research approach, he says, “I pursued my Isabella Bird studies as a geographer. I believe a geographer who is interested in time and space is most fit to the science of travel and travel writing.”,
,
,His 2017 work, “Isabella Bird and Japan: A Reassessment,” is part analysis, critique and biography. Applying scrupulous research methods and a commitment to authenticity, it traces Bird’s itineraries, family circumstances and religious activities before coming to Japan. Bird may have been an open-minded and innovative travel writer, but when it came to religious convictions, she was very much a product of her time. Bird’s blind spot, in common with almost every Western visitor to Japan at the time, was an inability to recognize the ethical qualities of non-Christian faiths and people. Despite being exposed on her journeys throughout Japan to the fruits of an advanced society, she was still able to write, “The nation is sunk in immorality … her progress is political and intellectual rather than moral.” Bird could, however, also be gracious and bestow praise where she saw fit. “I believe there is no country in the world in which a lady can travel with such absolute security from danger and rudeness as in Japan,” she wrote.,Bird was primarily a documentarist, the opposite of a sentimental traveler. Confronted by her publisher, John Murray, who implored her to tone down her realist descriptions of poverty, disease and hardship, she responded that she intended to “de-cherry-blossom” Japan. At Murray’s request, however, Bird set about writing an abridged version of her original 1880 text. It’s not clear whether reducing the two-volume work to a form that would complement the publisher’s existing series of romantic travel adventures resulted in a satisfying outcome for the author, or a mutilation. From the reader’s perspective, the resulting work, “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,” is near flawless, with the reformatting in no way detracting from the literary quality of the text.,
,
,In terms of travel scope, there are considerable differences between the original volume and the new abridged edition presented by Kanasaka in his 2020 work, “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan: Revisiting Isabella Bird.” Where the original included trips to the Kansai region and the grand shrines at Ise, the shorter, subsequent book focuses on a northbound journey from Tokyo, through Nikko, Niigata and the remote reaches of Tohoku, before concluding in Hokkaido.,In Kanasaka’s author preface and commentaries, which precede Bird’s travelogue, he outlines some of his additions that make the work more accessible. These include a re-pivoting of the book’s orientation, emphasizing the centrality of her journey to the less-traveled north. Where comprehensive notes, annotations, commentary, footnotes and annotations might seem burdensome in lesser hands, Kanasaka’s expansions are indispensable for text enrichment. In both “Revisiting Isabella Bird” and “A Reassessment,” Kanasaka quotes some troubling sources of misinformation on Bird, from accounts in the Japanese press of the period, to an unsparing critique of the misinterpretations, fumbling of facts, and sloppy research by some of his academic contemporaries.,An early proponent of investigative travel, in which accounts were rendered in a refined and distinctive prose style, Bird’s work, notably in her Japan account, prefigured the now common term, “literary travel writing.” With the exception of major figures in the field, such as the Irish travel writer Dervla Murphy, there are few contemporary writers who can match Bird’s authorial quality, determination and sheer gumption.,These two beautifully paired and illustrated books would seem a satisfying coda, the last word on Isabella Bird studies. One suspects, however, that the author may have a good deal more to say on the subject.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Andy Murray expressed sympathy for Naomi Osaka after she was rattled by a heckler during her second-round loss on Saturday night at Indian Wells, but said unruly fans were an unfortunate part of sports.,Osaka was thrown off her game and began to cry after a person screamed, “Naomi, you suck!” early on in her eventual 6-0, 6-4 loss to Veronika Kudermetova.,
,After the match, Osaka spoke directly to the otherwise supportive crowd, saying the incident reminded her of the abuse Venus and Serena Williams received at the tournament in 2001, which led them to boycott the event for more than a decade.,“I’ve been heckled before and it didn’t really bother me,” Osaka said while holding back tears.,“But being heckled here. I’ve watched video of Venus and Serena get heckled here and if you’ve never watched it, you should watch it. And I don’t know why, but it went into my head and got replayed a lot.”,Osaka has been open about her struggles with mental wellness in the past and took a break from the sport following her upset loss at last year’s U.S. Open. She said she was in a great place emotionally coming into the tournament.,“It’s a difficult one,” Murray told reporters after his second-round loss on Sunday.,“I’ve often thought watching certain sports, I wouldn’t say I’ve often seen it loads in tennis … but if I watch a football or a soccer match and a player’s going to take throw-in or a corner kick and the crowd are just hurling insults at those individuals.,“I always think, how is that allowed? Like, you can’t do that,” he said, adding that such behavior would be unacceptable in public or any other workplace setting.,Murray said he had heard comments that were “not comfortable” when playing Davis Cup matches away from home in intense environments.,“Obviously I feel for Naomi, that it upset her a lot but yeah, it’s always been something that’s been part of sport, I guess, as well,” Murray said.,“So, you know, you have to, I guess, be prepared for that in some ways and be able to tolerate it because it does happen regularly across all sports.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,No sooner did I get out of my seven-day stay at the “Hotel Quarantine” when ,.,Last week, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that the quarantine period will be reduced from seven to three days for those who have received their booster shots to protect themselves from COVID-19. And those individuals arriving from countries where the highly contagious omicron variant of the virus is “under control” will be exempted from quarantining at a designated facility altogether. That means you’ll be able to keep an eye on your health from the comfort of your own home.,
,Still, ,, chances are that you’ll need to follow some sort of regimen whether you’re a citizen returning from a business trip or an exchange student who has been waiting a long time to get here. Also, and I hate to be grim on this, we still can’t rule out the possibility of a new coronavirus variant making all of our lives miserable again.,Now that I’ve returned to the bustle of Tokyo, my own re-entry in mid-February is already starting to feel like a distant memory. However, I wanted to share the experience to let people know what they might be in for when they arrive.,One thing to remember, however: ,. I was lucky to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji every morning while I was holed up at a hotel near Haneda Airport, but some people may not have the same view.,In any case, here’s how my own stay panned out.,
,
,The preparation to get into Japan starts days before you even head to the airport you’re flying out of. There’s a string of different tasks that need to be checked off prior to departure, the first being to check what restrictions are in place for the country you have stayed in for 14 days before your arrival in Japan.,This can be done on the ,, but be warned — the guidelines are confusing. For some in-depth advice (and, unfortunately, some horror stories), Facebook’s , has a wealth of firsthand accounts and information.,Most people have to take a COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to departure. Testing is something you will probably be used to if you have traveled at all during the pandemic, but testing for arrival in Japan is a little more complicated.,Only some testing methods are valid for travel to Japan, including PCR and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method known as LAMP. If your test is not one of these, you won’t be allowed to board the plane — let alone pass through the numerous checks on arrival in Japan. You will also need an official MOFA testing form filled out by a medical professional. This can be very difficult to secure and seems to be the bane of many travelers, though my own experience went smoothly. Spend time researching testing companies.,When you get the MOFA form signed, make sure all your information — your name (including your middle name), passport number and date of birth — is correct. Any mistakes could cause unwanted problems down the line.,
,
,Pack provisions for your quarantine. The day before I left for the airport, I took a trip to the supermarket to buy some staples for my stay. I’m a vegetarian and had heard tales of small portion sizes and unexciting meals served during quarantine. I stocked my bag with snacks to nibble on throughout the day including vegetarian frankfurters, biscuits, crackers and potato chips. One thing I overlooked, but recommend packing, is any medication you need (with a copy of your prescription) or over-the-counter items to help with upset stomachs and the like.,Next up: the apps. You’ll need to download both the ,, which keeps track of where you are during the quarantine period, and ,, which checks for any contact with individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. You’ll also need to have the Google Maps app active on your smartphone.,A working smartphone is needed to enter the country (I was told there was also the possibility of renting one upon arrival at the airport), but a working Japanese sim card is not. The Wi-Fi connection at Haneda and Narita airports is strong and available for new arrivals to use.,
,The real journey begins at the airport you fly out of. Japan Airlines staff verified my visa, my test paperwork and pointed me to a QR code where I was told to fill in an online health questionnaire.,One positive of pandemic travel is the amount of space. I counted a grand total of 15 passengers on my flight from London. This meant that I could enjoy an almost glorious sleep sprawled out across a whole row of seats, which made a world of difference on arrival. Aboard the plane you will be asked to complete the , form, which confirms you understand the rules of quarantine.,After my long-haul flight, I arrived in Japan to a series of checkpoints that sit on a prescribed route through immigration — there’s more paperwork at each stop and you’re given a green tag to wear on your wrist, though I’m not sure it does anything but identify you as an arrival. The washrooms are taped off, so make sure to go before the plane lands. What seems like dozens — maybe hundreds — of staff line the route, many of them security guards.,My main advice for your arrival is to simply be patient. The process has, thankfully, been streamlined after outrageous reports of passengers spending upward of six hours trying to enter the country. Still, it took about four hours from landing at Haneda to arriving at my hotel. Keep your hand luggage to a minimum, bring snacks, a drink and something to read. The airport staff are friendly and many can speak English well.,Now we come to the journey’s on-arrival testing. This process involves spitting into a plastic vial in a cordoned off part of the airport, where photos of lemons and , (pickled plums) cheerfully look down at you to help get the salivary glands going. I noticed this part was a challenge for some people, especially after a long flight; children seemed to find this task particularly tricky.,After the checkpoints, you eventually arrive at the results room. Here you’ll sit with your fellow travelers and be called up according to your number to get your test result. This room had working vending machines and washrooms when I was there.,If your test is negative, you will be moved onto a bus and whisked off to a quarantine hotel (people who tested positive were simply taken to a different hotel).,
,
,It’ll be fine, I told myself, quarantine is just something I’ve got to do. Plus, I was with my partner. Throughout the process, however, staff told me that we would be in separate rooms. This wasn’t the case: upon arrival at the hotel, groups (couples and families) were asked to come forward first and we were assigned a twin room.,The tired but amiable staff talked us through how the whole thing worked. They gave me an electronic thermometer to take my body temperature at 8 a.m. everyday; meals would be delivered at 8:30 a.m., 12 p.m. and 5 p.m; alcohol and smoking are forbidden. Food deliveries are OK.,I won the hotel lottery. My room had a sofa, a large smart TV, a fridge, cups and glasses, bottled water, a kettle, coffee (not instant) and tea.,Mornings start with an announcement just before 8 a.m., first in Japanese and then in English: “We will soon be delivering your meals to your room, please refrain from going outside of your room.”,Another announcement is made 30 minutes later: “May I have your attention please, we have delivered your meals outside of your room.” The same announcement plays before every mealtime.,
,
,A bento is left outside your door in a plastic bag. The food varies depending on the hotel, but I was glad I brought extra supplies. The vegetarian meals were all vegan and, although healthy, were really small and not very exciting. It’s worth noting that there have been reports of some hotels not being able to supply meals to suit various dietary requirements.,Breakfast was the same each morning, a variation of beans and salad. Meat eaters can enjoy much more exciting treats such as fish, hamburg steak and an egg, but servings are still small and lack fruit or meaningful portions of vegetables. The hotel I was at allowed for food to be delivered by services such as Uber Eats, but these services aren’t available at every quarantine location. Plus there are rules about what items can be delivered: No raw food, frozen food, alcohol or anything that may cause a fire.,The six days of quarantine weren’t so bad. Time passed. I had to do another spit test on days two and six; I also had to complete location check-ins and health check-ups, and take automated video calls from the MySOS app.,The internet connection was decent, so I was able to catch up on some Netflix viewing (bring an HDMI cord in case you don’t get a smart TV). There was enough room for exercise and, although the window in my room didn’t open, the view kept me sane. I watched people and boats below, gazed at the industrial landscape of Kawasaki in the distance, and on clear days Mount Fuji even made a dazzling appearance.,For me, the fourth day was the hardest. It rained all day and my dinner was really small and bland. Staying positive is vital: Remember that this will not continue forever and that you will get out. Don’t let frustrations and anger take over, instead make sure to move your body, if just for some stretching, shower, get dressed each day (even if it’s just loungewear) and keep in contact with family and friends. It all helps.,
,Eventually, after the final COVID-19 test, you leave your hotel room behind. My test came on the sixth day, but from March that test will happen on the third day of wherever you are quarantining from. I also didn’t have the convenience of using public transport to make my way home, another condition that will change from March as trains, buses and taxis are once again options for new arrivals.,The options in front of me were renting a car, getting someone to collect me, taking a free shuttle bus into Tokyo or booking a private transfer. I chose to take the shuttle, thankfully it made a stop that was a 40-minute walk from my home. I stashed my hefty suitcase at a coin locker near the station, and came back for it the next day when I was allowed to use public transport again. Free at last, my partner and I bought some beer and ordered pizza for our first dinner out of quarantine and back in Japan. Just as every situation is different, so is everyone’s reward.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bold black Kampei and his more reserved counterpart, the ginger Sushiro, came from totally different backgrounds and different parts of Japan. However, they are now an unstoppable pair.,Three-year-old Sushiro was rescued from a Gunma hoarder and, having received very little attention, was so timid that he spent his early days at ARK hiding. But Kampei, an abandoned Osakan orphan about 2 years old, started to work his magic on Sushiro the moment they met.,
,Soon, shy Sushiro was asking to be picked up and started craving the attention he had never had. He is now in love with a good lap to snuggle up in. Kampei is truly fearless and despite looking like a panther he doesn’t have the agility of one. He is quite the socialite, chatty and always eager to get involved. Just like Sushiro, he is also an avid fan of laps.,Weird and wonderful, this duo would be a hit in any home.,
,Six-year-old Valiant was rescued as a puppy from the wilds of Gifu Prefecture. Wild in that he came from a place where the dogs pretty much had to fend for themselves. His senile owner had little idea of how many animals were roaming around his property, and even less about any of the dogs in particular.,With danger and uncertainty all about, Valiant was a very fearful puppy. In the years since, however, he has learned that it is possible to have trust in people and in his surroundings. Valiant is now more confident and his sweet nature has blossomed because of it.,A strong dog, he loves walks and dog runs, but is still wary around crowds of people or cars. He knows the instructions “sit,” “down” and “high five,” but his favorite is “give me a kiss.” It’ll melt your heart. Brushing will melt his.,Valiant has learned to trust, and now we’re hoping he can finally have the love and attention only a proper home can provide.,
,Rescue is nearly always a concerted effort in animal welfare, but the compassion and hope that saved these two cats came from some of its first-chair members.,The spring flood of kittens last year had gas chambers packed, but Heart Tokushima’s Susan Mercer pulled these two lucky ladies out in the desperate hope she could find other groups to take them. ARK answered the call for help, and four kittens came to Tokyo.,In the hopes that they would complement each other, Mercer had paired the colorful, friendly Mimosa (born in May) with the shy, black Pina, one month her senior. Due to earlier colds and the pandemic, the young ladies have had little exposure to prospective parents — but they are a dynamic duo.,“Mimosa is bouncy and forward, and adores people, cats, toys or whatever is at hand,” say ARK staffers. Though Pina was timid at first, she has blossomed into her own, with a rich purr that allows full expression of her deeply affectionate nature.,Though their wild antics may be more at home in a circus than an orchestra hall, these two are nonetheless “an incredibly entertaining pair.” They are sure to bring the house down.,
,Nao is a sweet little lady in Tokyo who, at the age of 14, is hoping to get a chance at more of a life than she has had.,For many years, Nao lived with an elderly woman whose caring was limited to giving the dog food. She didn’t take her on walks, she never saw to her medical care, and Nao was given no affection. When her situation came to the attention of a kindly British woman and then to the staff at ARK, her owner was happy to give the dog up.,Nao was in very bad shape at the time — horribly infested and her fur falling out in handfuls. She had almost “no visible musculature,” but that has is all changing. Now with a coat that has been shaved and is growing in nicely, she is gaining weight (up to 16 kilograms when last checked) and getting out into the fresh air for walks under open skies.,This change shows a lot of bravery and progress on her behalf. She is still a little bit nervous when touched, but she loves being near people and loves to eat. She is a gentle and healthy, fine with cats and other dogs, and she’s hoping for a home … a real home.,
,Toi came to ARK in June 2014. He’d been found abandoned in a box with his mother, who was fiercely guarding her kittens. It has been quite some years since then and, most likely to due to his timid nature, Toi has never found a home.,We’re hoping “never” can be a thing of the past, though, and that the Year of the Tiger will be Toi’s time to roar … in his own quiet way. There isn’t an ounce of aggressiveness in him. He allows his nails to be trimmed and his ears to be cleaned without putting up any fuss, and is far more comfortable with humans than before. He’s a good big brother to the newcomers, and really does want to get closer to people, but the shelter’s ruckus and general unease don’t help.,That doesn’t stop Toi from trying to get this message across though, and sometimes his purr is so loud you can hear it from a distance. Toi is handsome and has a heart of gold. All he needs is a home.,
,You may think Safe the dog gets his name from a sense of security. Unfortunately, his origin story provides a different explanation.,A safe is where this guy was kept —in a state of extreme neglect in an actual vault in a building. He was rarely fed, and in late November the owner, likely prompted by complaints, brought Safe and two other dogs to ARK. It was an act that most likely saved their lives as they were down to bare bones.,Safe is believed to be 10 years old, but he could be younger. Now weighing in at around 15 kilograms, he has filled out considerably.,Built like a Hokkaido breed or a solid Shiba, Safe is sprightly and calm and surprisingly friendly. He rarely barks and isn’t aggressive. Intelligent and trainable, Safe is very happy around people, and he’s the perfect size for those who like big dogs but need something a bit smaller. Smart, quiet, healthy, a great size — Safe gets a 10 out of 10 for being the perfect dog.,
,A hefty, yet handsome, one-eyed cat, Botamochi lost his home in mid 2020 and was first featured here in the Adopt Me! section a few months later.,Fortunately, the search for a new home didn’t take long, as only a few months later the Sato family of Osaka scooped this gem up after they lost one of their other two cats.,Now rechristened Popo, Botamochi is the third cat from ARK that the Satos have picked up.,“We found Popo when we went looking for a friend for Tama,” says father Shintaro, in reference to the family’s other cat. “We heard there hadn’t been much interest in Popo so we decided to adopt.”,The family’s kindness paid off, as Tama and Popo became friends within a week.,“We can hardly believe how well they get along,” Shintaro says. “They get really excited before dinner and groom each other like crazy. We think they are a really good match.”,Popo would most likely agree that it is indeed a fantastic match.,“Popo weighs nearly twice what Tama does and loves food, so he happily cleans up any of Tama’s leftovers,” explains Shintaro, who says the newcomer is also something of a guru. “He teaches us about relaxation by lying stretched out in a sunny spot. We simply love the sight of Popo and Tama relaxing together.”,It seems like this adoption was truly meant to be. “Thank you, Popo for coming to live with us!”,If you are interested in adopting one of these pets, email ARK at Tokyoark@arkbark.net or call 050-1557-2763 Monday to Saturday (bilingual) for more information. Tokyo ARK is an NPO founded by Briton Elizabeth Oliver. It is dedicated to rescuing and rehoming abandoned animals. All animals are vaccinated, neutered and microchipped. Prospective owners are requested to undergo a screening process.

			,Contributing writer,The end of February means an end to this year’s Black History Month, but that only has me thinking about its beginnings.,The annual observation of the triumphs and struggles of Black Americans hasn’t always been a month long. I can still remember it being Black History Week when I was in school — which itself was an achievement considering the attitudes of many of the white Americans in power.,
,In 1926, Carter G. Woodson, who has been called the “Father of Black History,” launched Negro History Week in the United States. He chose the second week in February to coincide with the birthdays of both President Abraham Lincoln (Feb. 12), who signed the Emancipation Proclamation that freed Confederate slaves in 1863, and Frederick Douglass (Feb. 14), an enslaved American who escaped bondage and became an orator and abolitionist. Douglass is also credited as the man who pushed Lincoln to see the better angels of his nature and allow Black men to fight for themselves in the Civil War as well as making the abolition of slavery central to the conflict.,Fifty years later, as America celebrated its bicentennial in 1976, Black educators and students across the country appealed to then-President Gerald Ford’s better angels, and the result was the expansion of Black History Week into Black History Month.,“In the bicentennial year of our independence, we can review with admiration the impressive contributions of Black Americans to our national life and culture,” Ford said on the occasion, urging Americans to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”,While we’re all aware of this historical moment now, in 1976 my friends and I hardly noticed a difference in our classrooms at Brooklyn’s Uhuru Sasa Shule, which is Swahili for “Freedom Now School.” The idea of honoring the “too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans” was etched in our school’s founding documents, and from kindergarten into my teens I attended the kind of private educational institution that Woodson could have only dreamed of.,You see, my school was founded in 1970 with the express goal of de-Europeanizing the minds of Black children by removing from us any inkling of white supremacist thought, instilling in us, instead, an abiding adoration and respect for all things of African and African American origin.,The day the expanded holiday was announced in my class, I remember the teacher explaining that the Black kids in the white-run public schools across the rest of the country only learned white American history, with mentions of non-whites here and there, and so they needed a Black History Month.,My classmates and I were all shocked to hear this. We assumed school was the same everywhere and knew that there were barely enough hours in the year to learn about all the Black heroes, mathematicians, scientists, doctors, lawyers and community leaders that populated our textbooks. We even learned about the kings and queens of African nations dating back to Songhai, Zulu, Kush, Egypt, Nubia and Ethiopia. How could all of that history possibly be squeezed into one month, let alone one week as it previously had been?,My teachers, all leaders in the Pan-African and Black Power movements, knew as Woodson did when he conceived of the holiday in 1926 that Black Americans needed a history to be proud of and to ensure that, in Woodson’s words, “the world see the Negro as a participant rather than as a lay figure in history.” I only fully understood this need when I came to Japan.,When I arrived in Tokyo to teach at an eikaiwa (English conversation) school in Nakano Ward, I took a look at the curriculum and realized it was what the teachers at Uhuru Sasa were afraid of. The lessons I was presented with focused almost entirely on positioning white people front and center. Things didn’t get much better when I moved to an assistant teacher position in Yokohama. By and large, the Black people in Japanese textbooks were the occasional athlete or some hapless kid in an underprivileged school in some destitute nation that was meant to represent all of Africa — or that one lesson on Martin Luther King, Jr. Meanwhile, the white people were well-represented in all areas: science, math, music, inventions, leadership and so on. Here was proof, right in front of my very eyes, of how the white supremacist version of American history had been exported abroad.,I did everything within my limited sphere of influence to rectify this problem. I pushed back against any stereotypes presented in the textbooks and whenever I had the opportunity to produce my own lesson materials, I’d make every effort to expand the students’ perspective of the Black world. I inserted Blackness into every lesson, putting Black people in roles that my Japanese students may have been trained to think were exclusively white.,For example, if the lesson was on occupations, and the textbooks were filled with whites in all the “brainy” jobs and blacks in all the “brawny” ones — as is too often the case — I’d rectify that by using my own pictures so that the students could see Black people in all kinds of occupations, as indeed is the case in the real world. When it came time for a holiday lesson, I taught all those children dreaming of a white Christmas about Kwanzaa, an African American holiday that was created by Maulana Karenga in 1966.,I didn’t hesitate to push back against my Japanese colleagues, either. Most of them were raised on and whitewashed by the same textbooks with similar — and sometimes worse — distortions or misrepresentations of Blackness.,The point is, even though Black History Month is coming to an end it doesn’t mean that we as educators need to stop inserting its spirit into our teachings. Every day of the year is as good as any day in February to learn the historical contributions people of African descent have made in the world, something I learned from my time at Uhuru Sasa.,When it comes to Japan, it’s probably even more necessary to expose our students to the different histories of the world — not just Black but Ainu, Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese, too. Make an appeal to the better angels of Japanese nature and do your part in fostering a generation that has empathy for those who look different.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The origin story of , has a familiar ring to it: A couple with a vision, toiling away in their spare bedroom with dreams of taking a killer product to market.,Fast-forward 12 years, and the educational resources platform has unspooled from its initial customer base in England to now serve 200 countries worldwide — with Japan as one of its focal markets in Asia.,
,Twinkl was founded upon a self-explanatory motto: “We help those who teach.” Its resources cover a wide range of disciplines, from English and computing to art and physical education. And while much of its content has been built around the British education system, many of those resources can double-up as English-language study materials. Alongside more ad hoc English study tools, such as phonics and alphabet practice, resource flexibility could be the key to unlocking the door to Japan.,Even before the pandemic, Japan’s ESL (English as a second language) teaching market was in rude health: English teaching has long been one of the most common jobs among Japan’s approximately 1.7 million foreign workers, especially for native speakers. According to their websites, major employers Aeon and ECC have more than 250 and 180 schools across the country, respectively. However, strict border pandemic protocols have made it difficult for schools to recruit new foreign teachers since spring 2020. Even the government-subsidized Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme , with the number of candidates believed to have fallen to around 4,000 in 2021 (including reappointments) compared with the 5,761 registered in fiscal 2019.,But there remains a clear demand for English education. Japan’s mid-January standardized university entrance exam has an annual participation of about 500,000 hopefuls, 99% of whom were assessed on their English proficiency last year.,Furthermore, starting in April 2020, English education was made mandatory at elementary schools for third-graders and above. This was likely a response to Japan’s poor English proficiency ranking in Asia the previous year: ,, ahead of only Laos and Tajikistan.,This suggests that the quantity of English teachers hasn’t always guaranteed quality lessons. English education resources in public and at , (English conversation) schools are often designed in-house to meet the specific objectives of a given course, with few auxiliary add-ons.,Resources can also remain in use for years with little or no updates — with some practice dialogues referring to anachronistic items like pagers and DVD players — and often need teacher guidance to have any real practical application outside the classroom. Moreover, English teaching companies in Japan often operate on a revolving-door model of recruitment, with willingness deemed more important than experience in the hiring process — a fact that highlights the importance of having good resources at a teacher’s disposal.,
,Twinkl doesn’t market itself as a wholesale replacement for the teaching materials already in use — though it can function for standalone learners — but rather offers a continuous update of complementary side dishes to accompany teaching frameworks. In England, Twinkl runs alongside the national curriculum, and the primary view to Japan is to have it coordinate with the areas of study taught at ESL schools.,“Everyone who works on the design team at Twinkl is either a former teacher, or is still teaching, and working at Twinkl as a secondary job,” says Lian McGillycuddy, manager of Twinkl’s Japan team. “They make resources that teach the same concepts that students will be learning at the same time.”,This process applies to creating resources for Japan’s ESL market, too. McGillycuddy and her team communicate resource ideas to the design team, based on what the Japanese education system expects of students at a given level, after which the in-house illustrators and content writers make the vision a reality.,Twinkl has demonstrated an ability to expand operations over the past decade, growing exponentially from its humble 2010 origins. Now in its 12th year, it has more than 12 million sign-ups worldwide, including 2.8 million new additions in the past 12 months alone. Twinkl creates an average of 13,000 resources each month, with the past 12 witnessing over 268 million resource downloads, partially fueled by a huge uptake in pandemic-enforced home schooling.,In spite of these figures, Twinkl’s presence in Japan is still small, where it competes with other such online learning platforms as ,, , and ,. There are currently only 18,550 registered users in the country, including free members and subscribers.,“We are trying to show Japan how popular Twinkl is, but because we don’t have as big a presence in Japan yet, it’s a little more difficult,” says McGillycuddy. “But I think if we keep showing how good the resources are, the word will spread.”,McGillycuddy is hoping high-profile collaborations can help Twinkl’s expansion. Current collaborations include cartoons “Peppa Pig” and “Numberblocks”, both of which appear on TV screens in Japan and are aimed at the largest segment of Twinkl learners: children.,She adds that the company is currently looking to collaborate with Japanese television shows, too. “It would be great for Japanese people to see something that’s familiar to them in our resources.”,
,
,Twinkl also has ambassadors scattered throughout the country, such as Michelle Nomura, an English tutor at ABC Club in Fukuoka who started using the platform in 2016.,“Twinkl has helped me a lot, not only for my lessons, but also for personal use raising my bilingual daughters,” she says. Nomura cites Twinkl Create, a program that allows users to design their own resources, the Twinkl app, which features in-built 3D and augmented reality functionalities, and Twinkl eBooks as resources that “really make life easier.”,Lea Takaiwa, a teacher at English Adventure Academy in Shiga Prefecture, echoes Nomura’s sentiment. “Twinkl is really an amazing educational site for English learners and teachers,” she says. “It is introducing me to different places, countries, cultures and many more that I can share with my students so they will be familiar with the outside world.”,But while Twinkl’s most obvious application in Japan is to the ESL market, it’s reluctant to pigeonhole itself. Part of the Japan team’s responsibilities is to localize resources that can be used by educators in the country’s public schooling system. Increasing Twinkl awareness through weekly newsletters and social media posts in Japanese is integral to achieving this ambition.,“(Twinkl) has been received very well,” says McGillycuddy. “We’re just trying to get the word out to more Japanese teachers and parents that we are here.”,For more information, visit ,.,

			,Contributing writer,A man, visibly agitated, walks into ,, a cafe opened by Vaughan and Rie Allison in the spring of 2020.,
,Vaughan greets him, like he does with all his guests. The man responds with pleasantries; he then gets to the reason for his unease. “My wife is pregnant,” he says. “She just went into labor at the hospital.” Because of COVID restrictions, he is unable to be there with her, adding, “I can’t be at home. I’m a bit nervous.”,He then asks, “I’m here. Is that all right?”,“Yes,” Vaughan responds. “You stay here.”, He has sculpted features framed by neatly trimmed facial hair and a large mouth, perennially curled into a smile. Speaking to him via video chat, he sits at the end of a long table in ,, a gallery owned by the Allisons that’s just a stone’s throw from Mia Mia. He’s dressed in a white sweatshirt that hugs his body, a dark green hat made of a woven fabric, and black-framed glasses tied with a strap that dangles near his ears. His long brown hair hangs around his head.,
,
,“What is hospitality?” he asks in a thick Australian accent. He’s serious, but his grin is still noticeable. “The other day, we had a training session with the staff, and I said, ‘OK, let’s look it up in the dictionary.’” Vaughan straightens his glasses and pulls out his phone. He rereads the definition — the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers — before asking me, as he asked his staff, “How much of making the best coffee in the world is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers?” The staff answered him with a list of 100 tasks and practices: cleaning the streets in front of the cafe, greeting pedestrians walking by, taking customers’ coats when they enter the cafe.,Hospitality is, he says, about creating “a space where people feel welcomed.”,Our conversation goes on for two hours, traversing a range of topics — Vaughan is well-versed in just about any subject. I ask him how he became this way: interested in each person he meets, engaging with them on anything from the banalities of Tokyo life to its more defining moments.,“It’s in the DNA,” he responds. “I get it from my mother.”,Vaughan grew up in Melbourne, Australia, pulling espresso shots from the age of 10 at his family’s theater restaurant. He recalls how his mother would roam the dining room, speaking with customers to learn “something beautiful” about each one before committing those stories to memory. Then, she would share them on stage during the intermission of whatever production was being presented.,“If it was a 50th anniversary, OK, what’s the secret to 50 years?” Vaughan says his mother would ask from the stage.,Rie, ,, also grew up around hospitality, working, as a teenager, in her family’s , (tavern) near a pilot training school in the southern coastal city of Miyazaki. She became close with the pilots, many of whom attended her and Vaughan’s wedding in Tokyo in 2011., As the crowd of regulars and first-timers grows, fueled by coffee, the expectant father checks his phone, waiting for word on the birth. Vaughan orchestrates conversation among the customers: “This man,” he says, “is just about to be a father. He needs some advice.” There’s no shortage of suggestions — “Stay calm.” “Good luck.”, 5 p.m. The after-work crowd arrives. The sun begins to set and the customers at the cafe are beginning to get anxious for the soon-to-be dad.,
,
, , (pronounced “my-a my-a”) mean a communal and temporary shelter in Wadawurrung, an Aboriginal Australian language — and this 30-square-meter location, within walking distance from Higashi Nagasaki Station on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, is similarly a space for people to meet and collaborate.,Rie chimes in from off camera on the need for spaces that facilitate creative partnerships. “Everyone wants to do something,” she says, “but they’re not sure if they can do it.” She comes into view, pulling up a chair next to Vaughan. She has short black hair and wears a bright, multicolored sweater. Her voice is quiet, but firm. “Let’s not say no to anything,” she says, explaining how the couple has fostered their community. “Just say yes. And think afterward.”,In front of the gallery, the Allisons have built a small garden out of layered boxes filled with dirt and sprouting plants, to draw passersby to aid in its care — the building blocks of a communal space. Around the garden, Rie has designed benches, long and welcoming, with compost for coffee grounds inside. A small wooden box, filled with shelves for books to take and to leave, rests on the sidewalk. Recently, it was filled with children’s books, and days earlier, they found an anonymous letter inside. “As I was taking my morning walk, I discovered the book post,” it said, handwritten in pen on floral stationary. “I am very happy that there is such an interesting place in the neighborhood.”,
,
,Vaughan walks outside with laptop in hand, near the garden and benches. An endless stream of schoolchildren in orange hats walk by as he stands on the street. He waves and bows. An older man approaches with a plate of food in hand. They exchange greetings, and Vaughan introduces him as the owner of a restaurant down the street. Vaughan laughs and says, “It’s very difficult to do work here because conversations happen with all the people that walk past.”,The Allisons have helped put the area around Higashi Nagasaki Station on the map. This sleepy stop in between the central hub of Ikebukuro and the capital’s bedroom communities is now known as a destination for food and coffee. Several Japanese magazines have left their usual downtown haunts to feature the neighborhood, with Mia Mia front and center in the coverage. This is partly due to Vaughan’s own media savvy, having worked as a model and in the music industry. He has also created , — a website, an event, a shop — that aims to shine a spotlight on top coffee shops and support the cafe community. He’s serious about his craft, citing Eiichi Kunitomo of the renowned , as something of a mentor, boasting that Mia Mia is the only cafe in the world to purchase Kunitomo’s beans wholesale.,Vaughan pulls out a small white pamphlet, its cover printed with an illustration of Mia Mia, crowded with a mess of locals and cafe regulars. Inside the pamphlet is a map of Higashi-Nagasaki with meticulous illustrations by Hikaru Yamamoto of local shops, small blurbs and a short lyrical ode to the neighborhood written by Tokyo Weekender editor Paul McInnes, himself one of the cafe’s regulars. The small map is both a guide to the area and a neighborhood manifesto — foldable, physical evidence of the benefits of community building., Vaughan has kept the cafe open after hours for the crowd of around 20 customers — many strangers until that day — eager to see this story to the end. The man receives word that his baby, a girl, has been born. There’s a collective sigh of relief and a round of congratulations for the new dad.,“There were tears from everyone,” Vaughan recalls, smiling. “It was a magical moment.”,

			,SPONSORED CONTENT,When offices closed down due to the pandemic in early 2020, workers had to figure out their minimum needs — the basic equipment, space and environment for them to continue to be productive. Yet it did not take long for some to realize the goal should not be to reproduce the traditional office environment as closely as possible, but to create spaces and practices that could make work and even life in general even more fulfilling.,Hidaiiyo Co. has taken up this challenge, and with its new coworking space Trace it is taking a big step toward creating a work-life environment that nourishes mind, body and soul.,Trace is situated in Hida, Gifu Prefecture, an old castle town in the heart of Japan’s Northern Alps. It is a short drive from Takayama, the popular tourist destination renowned for its traditional architecture, particularly the steep , thatched-roof farmhouses in the village of Shirakawa. Hida, on the other hand, boasts a historical commercial district populated by elegant wooden , (townhouses), Trace now occupying one of them.,The name Trace comes from the Japanese word ,, which is also used to mean trajectory or path, and is intended to evoke the journeys and adventures of the people and companies that spend time there, hopefully stimulated and facilitated by the environment it provides.,Hidaiiyo’s goal with Trace and its other endeavors is to not only provide a functional space for office workers to get their work done away from home, but also to integrate all the aspects of the surrounding community to create a synergistic effect that fosters creativity and fulfillment.,Inside Trace itself are comfortable shared workspaces, private rooms for meetings and a kitchenette. Individual memberships are priced at ¥25,000 per month and ¥40,000 monthly for corporate memberships.,In addition to the workplace amenities, use of the facility’s sauna room can be added to a membership. There may be no better way to relax and reset after a day spent focused on work. It may not be a typical office practice, but could a lunchtime sauna help boost afternoon productivity? This is the place to experiment.,The surrounding area is also part of the concept. Trace is on Shirakabe Dozogai street, a historical district of traditional warehouses and townhouses with a small canal teeming with colorful carp from spring to autumn. The refined elegance of this neighborhood is a world away from typical business districts filled with traffic, advertisements and crowds of people focused only on their destinations.,Zooming out encompasses the greater region — Hida’s narrow valley with its rivers and farms, the forested hills that surround the town on every side and to the west the impressive peaks of the Northern Alps, all of which can be made part of the experience of working and staying here.,The concept even extends to after work. Hidaiiyo also runs Iori Stay, a “distributed” hotel that consists of separate townhouses that are rented out individually. There are four Iori Stay locations in Hida and several more in nearby Takayama. All the Hida locations are just a few minutes’ walk to Trace. Absolutely no crowded trains or traffic jams here. The townhouses have been renovated in a style that combines traditional elegance and beauty with modern comfort and function. Guests can also choose from a variety of experience-based tours and activities designed to deepen familiarity with the local community and its traditions.,The Trace experience can be used for short “workations,” corporate training camps, as a second office away from more urban headquarters, or as a permanent base for businesses that are fully remote or locally focused. The world is changing and the time is right to create a new work-life balance focused on inspiration and health.,For more information, visit ,The Japan Times LTD. All rights reserved."

			,Contributing writer,Conversations about nonfungible tokens and their role in fashion appear to be running out of steam on the world stage. The arc from initial NFT excitement to eventual burnout has been remarkably short, and in the context of fashion — where the production run of a particular design sometimes tallies less than 100 items — the industry doesn’t need to introduce any artificial scarcity when it has the real thing.,Still, it is probably best not to abandon NFTs just yet, with some of the biggest names in Japanese retail recently announcing plans to engage in the world of digital assets. BEAMS fired the first shot on Feb. 25 by partnering with Rakuten’s NFT marketplace, followed by Shibuya 109’s March 2 announcement of a collaboration with Hong Kong-based digital platform The Sandbox. While both brands have always adjusted their image to remain in sync with the times, both are enduring tastemakers who rarely put a foot wrong when it comes to engaging with young people looking to express themselves.,
,The late start might make you think that these brands have missed the boat, but what we are seeing now in terms of fashion is a potential long-term strategy. The first wave of NFTs has been characterized by booms, busts and get-rich-quick schemes for the digital age that mimic hyped streetwear drops (the NFT connoisseur’s wardrobe of choice). Such customers are of little concern to a second wave of corporate NFTs, which target younger people whose greatest investment to date is probably their smartphone.,In the case of ,, the one-time mecca of the , subculture of the late 1990s, the focus is less on NFTs as an investment than as status symbols and digital modes of expression. Shibuya 109 is also quick to stress that consumers will be able to earn NFTs through online games free of charge — the perfect price point for a generation used to grinding for rewards on smartphones.,It is also part of Shibuya 109’s endeavors to reach international tourists who have been locked out of the market. For many young women — especially those living in East Asia — the iconic building is a destination synonymous with the “Tokyo fashion look,” a reality for a domestic market keen to be taken seriously on the world stage, but one that should have been capitalized on in earnest decades ago.,
,
,That said, it is hard to know what to expect from the recent announcements by BEAMS and Shibuya 109. The virtual worlds where these NFTs exist are still in development and the proof-of-concept visuals are a little underwhelming — a cardinal sin in the world of fashion. While BEAMS and Shibuya 109 have telegraphed their NFT ambitions, it is difficult to get overly excited about the final form of the asset — somewhere between “entertainment” and “online avatar” — until more is revealed.,But this is all to frame these developments from a consumer’s perspective. From a retailer’s perspective, this burgeoning metaverse offers an advertising-supported platform to target youthful shoppers. It’s based on an assumption that young people will actually visit these locations in the first place, but for brands whose cultural relevance is everything, it is a cultural turn they need to be part of. Of course, seeing the emerging metaverse as yet another place that is going to support advertising saps even more enthusiasm out of the experience, but it is probably worth reserving judgment until some practical applications are actually ready to showcase.,Having the support of established and experienced companies like Rakuten and The Sandbox is clearly the strategy to avoid the inevitable growing pains that emerge when brick-and-mortar fashion retailers engage with digital real estate, and starting fashionably late allows companies to bet on a metaverse that is already successful.,How successful, you might ask? As a case in point, a plot of land in The Sandbox’s flagship virtual world recently sold for nearly ¥500 million, a sum that would go a long way in buying a physical property space in central Shibuya.,Those looking to visualize this unknown territory can take a look at a new app from 1SEC, the company behind Japan’s first fully digital fashion label 1Block. The app, , (“drip” being the current slang for haute fashion), allows users to try on NFT clothing using augmented reality technology. Crucially, users can only try on clothes they own as NFTs, and it goes without saying that the NFT must also be compatible with the app for the digital clothes to be rendered.,It is somewhat sad to see brands replicating models of scarcity in a virtual world where true abundance is possible. However, what we are seeing now is only something early adopters can play around with. Once such technology reaches the average customer at Shibuya 109, then we will have really turned a corner.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The humble yet versatile , (carrot) is thought to have arrived in Japan via China at some point in either the 16th or 17th century. The Japanese originally called it a “,” (celery carrot) since, back then, the word “ninjin” was used to refer to ginseng root, which the carrot somewhat resembles.,However, the type of carrot that was grown here up until the Meiji Era (1868-1912) is now known as the red or Oriental carrot. Unlike its Western counterparts, the red carrot has, as its name suggests, a dark red color and is sweeter. It’s also harder to grow, which is why the orange Western types are what’s mainly consumed in Japan these days.,
,Carrots appear in all kinds of dishes that are popular in Japan, and the recipe featured here is a traditional one from Okinawa known as , (shredded carrot). It’s said that everyone in Okinawa has their own recipe for ,, so consider this to be just one variation. The word “shiri-shiri” is Okinawan for “,” (shredded) and there’s a theory that it is an ideophone derived from the “shiri shiri” sound that the carrots make on a shredder. It is a colorful side dish that works well in bento boxes, or you can increase the egg count and have it for breakfast instead.,
,
,You can use vegetable oil instead of the sesame oil and omit the sesame seeds if desired. Also, try using canned luncheon meat cut into strips instead of the tuna. You can also leave out the tuna and add a teaspoon of dashi stock granules for extra umami.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Deep-fried breaded meat dishes are enjoyed in many parts of the world: South American milanesa, Central European schnitzel and decadent chicken Kiev. In Japan, appetites are similarly sated by ,.,A compound of the words “,” (pork) and “,” (short for , [cutlet]), this dish is one of many Japanese takes on , (Western food). The dish ,, and others say that a , (pork cutlet) served with shredded cabbage popped up on the menu of Ginza restaurant , four years later — where it remains to this day.,
,Farther north, in Kanda, is ,, the restaurant that is credited with serving the first actual tonkatsu in 1929. Tokyo’s , (downtown) area witnessed a boom in places that served tonkatsu around the 1930s, remnants of which can still be found in districts like Jimbocho. The popularity of the dish is now widespread, from Michelin-recognized restaurants nestled in the capital’s downtown to the chain restaurants of the suburbs — the first of which, Wako, launched in 1958 and has since expanded overseas.,This list could easily be a top 50, but what follows are five prize-fighting tonkatsu specialists in Tokyo chosen for their renown and reasonable prices. So grab some hot mustard and shredded cabbage for your sides and tuck in.,
,
,In explaining the reason for conferring a Bib Gourmand accolade on ,, close to Musashi-Koyama Station, the Michelin Guide cites the restaurant’s use of light batter and comparatively less oil than your average tonkatsu joint. It’s a recipe that has impressed customers and made it pretty tough to get a seat at the nine-chair counter. Reservations will be necessary.,If you’re able to get in, what awaits is a world of sophistication, where classical music plays with the percussive accompaniment of breaded pork gently bubbling in a bronze cauldron of oil. Experiencing the symphony play out from your seat is part of the fun.,The , (loin fillet) set (¥1,600) gets you tea and chunky , (pickled vegetables) so fresh it’s like they’ve just been made; warming , (soup with daikon, pork and ,); a bowl of rice; and the main event itself, encased in pale gold panko.,The word “mochi” in the shop’s name seems more than appropriate when you take your first bite, the fillet gently tenderized beforehand for optimal chew. Take a close look and you can almost see it falling apart. The meal also comes with a mound of , (shredded) cabbage that is best experienced with a dab of the Chinese-style dressing. For cabbage fiends out there, your first refill is on the house.,Koyama 3-22-7, Shinagawa-ku, 142-0062; 03-3786-1464; takeout available,
,
,Make your way to Gakugei-Daigaku Station in Meguro Ward and you’ll be within walking distance of one of Tokyo’s more relaxed tonkatsu shops. Katsuyoshi’s homespun interior features vintage beer advertisements, chunky wooden furniture and the hum of nocturnal jazz spilling into the space. The main attraction, the rōsu-katsu set, costs ¥1,830. If you’re not looking to spend as much, though, the regular tonkatsu set is priced at just ¥1,100 and still tastes divine.,The loin cut here is covered with a thick batter unpunctuated by panko; it’s barely used. It’s something of a rarity and results in more of a chew than a crunch. The cut is also huge, a juicy monster of a fillet that will allow for ample time to soak up the atmosphere as you work your way through it. The set comes with tea, extra-salty miso soup, pickles and rice. Truthfully, Katsuyoshi represents any number of genuine , (neighborhood) tonkatsu joints: Unhurried, unfussy and unhyped.,Chuo-cho 1-17-11, Meguro-ku, 152-0001; 03-5704-2110; takeout available,
,
,If you’re in Daikanyama and looking for a wholesome lunch without the high prices that the neighborhood is known for, direct yourself to Genta. This subterranean dining spot features a friendly atmosphere with both table and counter seating. The lunch menu is a trove of delicious bargains, with the tonjiru tonkatsu set clocking in at just ¥1,100. If , (minced pork cutlet) is your jam, then you’ll only be set back ¥1,045 for the pleasure.,The crunch factor is strong at Genta, whose cooks deliver a masterclass in deep-fried texture, even if the measure of the meat is fairly modest. The cuts are leveled up when slathered with the shop’s zingy katsu sauce or some , (seven-flavor spice). Paired with rice, pickles and washed down with a soup so chock full of veggies that it’s like a meal in itself, lunch here is affordable and filling.,Sarugakucho 24-7, Shibuya-ku, 150-0033; 03-3496-4192,
,
,For more in the realm of affordability, check out the deep-fried lunch served at Tonkatsu Enraku in Ota Ward. You’ll almost certainly need to line up outside and wait for a seat, but you can watch the master at work in the meantime — the flames licking the side of the scorched, shining pan he uses while tending to the various breaded fillets within. Using bare hands all the while, his skin must be made of stronger stuff than most. At only ¥1,000, lunch is incredibly cheap.,The 90-gram rōsu-katsu is pliable and succulent, covered in craggy panko that is submerged in lard oil and fried to perfection. Naturally, it comes with cabbage — fresh cut for each order — soup populated with almost unending little pork morsels, carrots and daikon, a plate of rice and a surprise helping of homemade potato salad adding creaminess to the proceedings.,Enraku is another shop that has earned Bib Gourmand status from the Michelin Guide and there’s no surprise why: Eating this well for so little seems almost too good to be true.,Ikegami 6-1-4, Ota-ku, 146-0082; 03-3754-8243; takeout available,
,
,Another spot that’s sure to have a line outside, , in the Takadanobaba area goes the extra mile to extend its hospitality to those waiting. When it is raining, staff will ferry out tea to customers huddled beneath umbrellas and poring over the menu. Once inside, Hinata delivers a close-quarters affair at a long counter complemented by elegantly simple interiors and stylish hexagonal floor tiles.,Lunch, as per this working city’s custom, is normally a big deal. But here, it is a revelation. You have the option to choose between two different types of pork: ,, pigs with “three origins” (usually a cross between Berkshire, Duroc and Landrace breeds) fed on herbs used in Chinese traditional medicine, and , (Berkshire pig). Once you’ve decided on either the 130-gram regular cutlet for ¥1,000 or the , cutlet at 190 grams for ¥1,500, sit back and soak up the ambience. Both come served with the usual katsu sauce, but the sea salt provided for dipping makes this a bit redundant, albeit delicious.,Additionally, bigger spenders can also book a spot for Hinata’s evening , (eat and compare) course, involving different cuts of pork from tenderloin to rump, for ¥3,900 per person.,Takadanobaba 2-13-9, Shinjuku-ku, 169-0075; 03-6480-2424; takeout available,
,If you’re up for spending a little bit more, , is very much a treat. Located in Suginami Ward’s Minamiasagaya neighborhood, Narikura’s tonkatsu set offers up either two (¥5,000) or three (¥6,200) cutlets — including , (special loin), , (rib-eye) and , (millefeuille) style — though regular menu items are also available. The cooking style here is low and slow, resulting in a pale tempura-esque panko coating coupled with meat that melts in your mouth. Understandably, the menu has nabbed some awards.,Similar accolades go to the equally not-so-wallet-friendly , in Yotsuya. Again, the panko here is light and deliciously crispy, but the preparation is different, with whole loins cooked and sliced into meaty medallions for seriously tender results. Though the menu here features ¥4,000-plus items, more affordable options are available such as the rōsu-katsu set at ¥2,197.,Steps away from Chawanbu is the friendly ,. They use 100% lard oil for frying here and it’s their , (cutlet on rice with egg; ¥1,300) that is the star of the show.,If you find yourself in the Akihabara electronics district and you’re hankering for some tonkatsu, swing by the shitamachi-style Marugo. The lines can be enormous (avoid the place on Sundays) but your patience will pay off once you’re inside another of the city’s acclaimed shops. The special rōsu-katsu set (¥2,200) is fairly easy on the budget and very easy on the taste buds.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer, In 2008, I volunteered to help jobless people at , following the “Lehman shock.” It was my first experience with activism and I met people from Posse there.,
, Poverty in Japan tends to be hidden. I went to a university seminar about it and realized how serious it is. In my search for solutions, I volunteered and found Posse., We had slightly more men in our group before the pandemic started, but now around 80% are women. Most of them are students in their teens or 20s, some have full-time jobs. Many of our members are also minorities in some way: women, mixed race or LGBTQ., Poverty is increasing and I think it will increase further if we don’t change. One barrier is the , (self-responsibility) mindset in Japan that results in people being less empathetic toward others., The number of consultations concerning mistreatment in the workplace increased from 2,000 cases a year to around 5,000 cases in the first year (of the pandemic)., Actually, the laws themselves are pretty decent. The problem is that companies don’t follow these laws, and the penalties aren’t strong enough. For example, the law says people should not work more than eight hours a day and up to 40 hours per week. If they work more, they should be paid 20% to 50% more for the overtime., Women and foreign workers who are non-regular employees, who are themselves the most vulnerable as many of them had jobs that were affected by the pandemic., For a long time, female workers have been treated as people working for extra money because society expected them to have husbands who would provide for them. Of course, this is not the case., One solution could be that we value care work more. Right now, care work is treated like something anyone can do and the pay is low. That’s not the case, it is quite difficult and payments for it should increase., No. Elitism is a huge problem in Japan and I used to think that I could only spark change by becoming a part of the system. However, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders showed us all that by amplifying the concerns of smaller social movements you can rally the youth. We need that in Japan.,
,
, Young people in Japan aren’t taught they are capable of affecting change. Posse wants young people to know that they can make change through activism. The first step is education., Yes, there are a lot. , where we helped a high school sophomore through the collective bargaining process and, as a result, got him two years of unpaid overtime at his job. That action also resulted in payments to the 70 other employees of the company. He was the only one to stand up to the company, but it resulted in justice for the rest of his coworkers., Jiko-sekinin, they feel like they are on their own. People, especially young people, feel trapped in this capitalist competition so they don’t want to disadvantage themselves by speaking up (and being seen as complaining). If they fail, they simply blame themselves., According to the polls, young people are becoming more conservative. However, I don’t think it’s that simple, we just don’t want our situations to become worse. The pandemic has made a lot of us passive, but there is also a sense that we are trapped in our current situations. So to answer the question, I think we have to clearly show to young people a vision of how things can be. If there is no vision, there’s nothing to work toward., I enjoy reading science fiction. Ken Liu (“The Paper Menagerie”) is one of my favorite authors., It allows me to escape reality for a little while, but also helps me think outside the box. That way of thinking helps when I return to reality., Yes, I’m interested in “solarpunk” (a genre that envisions a future where humanity has solved problems like climate change) and “ecopunk” (a genre that focuses on how humans interact with their environment) because they explore the role of activism, but that stuff hasn’t been translated into Japanese yet., One idea that has stayed with me is from science-fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin who believed that the role of a writer is to fuel imagination. I need imagination because I am a Japanese man who lives in Tokyo. Books allow me to see different perspectives and different lives., Yes, because we need to think about what comes next. Abroad, activism is performed in imaginative ways, but we aren’t at that level in Japan yet., I’d like to make a project that could help others visualize a new kind of society that isn’t centered around money but is based on valuing people. If we use our imaginations, we could really blossom in that way.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady said Sunday he has changed his mind about retirement and will return to the NFL next season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.,Brady won six titles in 20 seasons with the New England Patriots then moved the Bucs in 2020 and led them to a Super Bowl title.,
,Tampa Bay lost to Los Angeles Rams, the eventual champions, in the playoffs in January and Brady announced his retirement last month.,Now the superstar quarterback, who turns 45 in August, says he wants at least one more chance at a championship.,“These past two months I have realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,” Brady said in a social media post. “That time will come. But it’s not now.,“I love my teammates and I love my supportive family. Without them, none of this is possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa.,“We have unfinished business.”,Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians was thrilled to welcome back Brady.,“Tom Brady loves to play football as much as anyone I’ve ever been around,” Arians said.,“He’s still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season. We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship.”,The Buccaneers simply posted a video of Brady on Twitter with the message: “He’s baaackkkk.”,The move comes in time for the team to adjust its free agency and draft plans to allow for the legendary signal caller to be back in uniform in the upcoming season.,“We’re thrilled that Tom has decided to come back this season,” Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said. “We said we would leave all options open for him should he reconsider his retirement and today’s announcement is something we have been preparing for in recent days.,“Bruce and I have had plenty of conversations with Tom recently that led us to believe there was a realistic chance he’d want to come back.,“Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level. With this decision now made, we will continue to move forward with our offseason plans to reload this roster for another championship run.”,Brady’s retirement lasted 40 days.,After speculation and reports Brady was going to hang up his cleats for the last time, he confirmed his retirement plans on Feb. 1, saying then he no longer felt he could commit to the sport.,“I have always believed the sport of football is an ‘all-in’ proposition — if a 100% competitive commitment isn’t there, you won’t succeed,” Brady wrote last month. “This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore.”,Brady, however, has found he’s ready to handle the hours of workouts in order to prepare for another title quest with the Buccaneers.,Among the most excited people to hear about Brady’s return was Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who had been the defender Brady victimized for his final career touchdown pass. Now other defensive backs could face that fate.,“THANK YOU,” Ramsey tweeted, “throw that last touchdown on somebody else.” Brady, a five-time Super Bowl MVP and three-time NFL MVP, already has a record 243 regular-season victories.,Brady will be rewriting the NFL record book every week. He already owns NFL career passing records with 7,263 completions on 11,317 attempts for 84,520 yards and 624 touchdowns.,The record he wants to erase the most is the one he holds as the oldest player to play in and win a Super Bowl, a stage he graced no fewer than 10 occasions.,His legacy includes a dramatic rally in the 2017 Super Bowl, when he led New England from a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons in the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.,Brady said last month he would recall his career as a “thrilling ride” and would “remember and cherish these memories and re-visit them often,” saying he felt like “the luckiest person in the world.”,For all the accolades Brady received from sports stars around the world, he actually took the advice of retired NBA icon Shaquille O’Neal, who tweeted last month that Brady should “Get your butt up and do one more year.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

Stage,,Rena Matsui tackles Shakespeare in an all-female 'Julius Caesar',"

                    Thank you for supporting our journalism.
                    ,13,M/CLOUDY,
				,
			,Contributing writer,Rena Matsui always knew she wanted to enter the acting world, and launching her career by performing in idol-pop groups was all part of her plan.,She started out as a member of the Nagoya-based SKE48 in 2008 before joining Nogizaka46 in Tokyo, becoming one of the top stars of Japan’s many all-female singing and dancing troupes. In 2015, she left both groups to dedicate herself to acting.,
,“I was determined to be an actor, so I decided to be an idol in order to get that chance,” she says in a recent video call.,Growing up in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, Matsui developed an early interest in stage performances through her mother’s love of the Takarazuka Revue, a long-running all-female musical theater company.,“Then, when I watched a DVD of (playwright and director) Koki Mitani’s musical ‘Okepi!,’ which shows the goings-on and gossip between musicians in an orchestra pit, I was amazed by how great it was to explore the entertainment world by focusing on people who aren’t always in the spotlight,” she says.,“I realized that theater has room for unconventional ideas, and I wanted to be an actor who uses their own rich imagination to express intangible things on stage.”,Now Matsui, 30, is taking her acting career to new heights by tackling her first Shakespeare play, an all-female version of the Roman tragedy “Julius Caesar.”,
,
,In this production — running through Oct. 31 at the Parco Theater in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, ahead of a nationwide tour till Nov. 28 — Matsui plays the pivotal role of Mark Antony, a general and follower of Julius Caesar (Sylvia Grab), the charismatic leader of the Roman republic.,Rather than staging the play’s battle scenes, however, director Shintaro Mori has condensed the original text to focus on the tense verbal disputes that arose among Rome’s ruling classes before and after the assassination of Caesar on March 15, 44 B.C.,The play opens days before the deadly deed, with two of Caesar’s erstwhile supporters, senators Cassius (Kio Matsumoto) and Marcus Brutus (Yo Yoshida), agonizing over their leader’s abuses of power. To preserve the republic, the pair hatch a plot to kill Caesar, which soon gains wide support.,After completing their mission — with numerous assailants stabbing Caesar 23 times — Cassius and Brutus stay in Rome to defend their actions. However, when Antony addresses the public, calling for compromise and the conspirators to be spared punishment, his speech subtly turns the crowd against Cassius and Brutus. While his eloquent oration — which famously begins with the lines, “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him” — heads off an uprising against Rome’s aristocrats, it also effectively nixes the rebels’ calls for reform.,“This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays because I saw a great version by the Kaki Kuu Kyaku theater company in 2013. That, too, was performed by a cast of women and they exposed the Roman power games in a high-tension, high-speed production… (their version) was enjoyable and easily intelligible, too,” Matsui says.,“Another reason I love this play is that it follows several ambitious characters, whereas many classic plays focus on one protagonist. I think it’s exciting as the story changes quickly in a way that is very contemporary.”,Meanwhile, she says the all-female cast didn’t feel strange about playing the roles of male aristocrats.,“We don’t speak in low voices to pretend to be men, and we don’t wear trousers, but simple dresses. So we look (and sound) like women — but speak as male characters — and it seems very natural to me. It’s my first experience with this kind of casting, and I actually feel as though I’m acting like a human being, not particularly like a man,” Matsui explains.,She adds that she enjoys hearing how the characters change their voices depending on who they’re speaking to, revealing the power dynamics between the four leads. She was especially amused by how Cassius implemented different voices for various purposes when talking to Brutus. “I almost laughed when I first heard that,” Matsui says.,While the actress says this production is a “genderless drama,” she recognizes the ways in which the all-female cast affects the staging. She points out, for example, that the mood of the masses — played by a female chorus — “changes in harmony” as a result of “womanly conformity” rather than “manly dominance.”,As for her own role, Matsui says it was difficult to play Antony, who cleverly sways the crowd to ostracize Brutus and Cassius, in a bid to take over Rome himself.,Matsui observes that many characters in the play say what they believe and act accordingly. When Brutus kills Caesar, for instance, it’s because he wants to protect Rome and he fears that Caesar is becoming a tyrant — even though he truly loves and respects him. Afterward, he does not flee the scene. “So Brutus had an unshakable belief that he lived by,” Matsui says.,Antony’s true intentions, however, are not as clear. Matsui says she wonders whether Antony was really distressed about Caesar’s death, or if his display of sadness was actually a performance for the Roman citizens.,“It’s very difficult to understand Antony’s mental state, and my initial interpretations kept changing.,“Then the director advised me not to overanalyze it, and just to say the lines again and again. He said that if I repeated the lines every day, I would be able to ride the waves of the role, like mastering surfing. Now I’ve reached that moment and I’m having fun being Antony.”,Keeping Mori’s advice in mind, Matsui says she connects with the Roman general’s feelings through her movements on stage as well.,“If I had made a concrete acting plan for Antony’s speech in advance, the scene would have become superficial and rigid. So when I stand at the rostrum, in my mind I’m just speaking to each member of the public listening to me. That way, I sense the energy of the masses gradually building until they finally connect to Antony’s words, enabling them to stand firm against the conspirators.,“However, it’s technically very difficult because I can’t make eye contact with every individual.

			,Contributing writer,For his first foray into the realm of opera, dramatist Toshiki Okada is tackling Ikuma Dan’s one-act “Yuzuru” (“Twilight Crane”), a Japanese classic that has been performed here almost 1,000 times since its premiere in 1952.,It is certainly not the first time that the 48-year-old Okada, who is the founder of Tokyo’s globe-trotting Chelfitsch theater company and winner of many of Japan’s top drama awards, has sought to expand his creative horizons. From 2016 to 2019, he held the position of director of repertoires at the Munich Kammerspiele in Germany, and in June he presented his self-penned contemporary noh play, “Unfulfilled Ghost and the Monster: Zaha/Tsuruga,” which questions both Japan’s nuclear power policy and the discord among Olympic organizers that resulted in one scandal after another in the lead-up to this year’s Games.,
,The opera “Yuzuru” is based on a 1949 play of the same name by leading postwar playwright Junji Kinoshita, which draws upon a folk story about a poor farmer named Yohyo (Takumi Yogi) who saves an injured crane that later transforms into a beautiful woman named Tsu (Sara Kobayashi) and marries him.,As a sign of her gratitude, Tsu uses her feathers to weave beautiful fabric for Yohyo to sell, but she asks her husband to promise he will never watch her at work. Yohyo agrees, but goaded by his money-grubbing friends Sodo (Hirohisa Sannohe) and Unzu (Koji Terada), he urges her to weave more and more, leaving Tsu wondering why he isn’t content with a simple life together.,One night, Yohyo peeks into her room and sees an ailing Tsu in her crane form, busily weaving. When his wife discovers that he has broken his promise, she flies away into the night sky and leaves him forever. It is then that Yohyo realizes he has lost a love that no amount of money will ever make up for.,At a press conference ahead of the opera’s opening, Okada seemed undaunted by staging such a well-known piece, saying, “I’ve never had much to do with opera before. But as I got this great opportunity, I wanted to find out what exactly a director does in opera.”,Bringing his wealth of experience in dramatic theater to “Yuzuru,” Okada said he “discovered the point of my role” after roughly a week of workshops and rehearsals with the conductors and singers.,“Before this project, I understood music as a rather abstract art form far removed from stories and meanings, but I now newly realize that opera music expresses the story and the characters’ feelings in every way,” he said. “Therefore, opera directors don’t need to be involved in such things as creating the characters during the rehearsals. So, I am going about this in a different way from my usual theater approach.”,And yet, soprano Kobayashi said that she was surprised that Okada spent such a long time discussing the opera’s content with the cast — adding that is “very rare in conventional opera rehearsals,” which mostly focus on the actors’ singing.,Tenor Yogi agreed, saying, “We are having discussions about everything together. Okada decides each movement based on our communal understanding after listening to everyone’s opinions. Even if a scene doesn’t relate to me, he asks for my opinion, and inevitably that makes me become more interested in the other characters.,“I was never like that before. It’s entirely new for me and I am so excited about this new method.”,Okada’s democratic way of working is not the only aspect that makes this production of “Yuzuru” different from past stagings. Instead of presenting a love story centered on a tragic female character, the director said his contemporary version will focus on “the damaging influence of capitalism,” critiquing how irreplaceable assets are mindlessly wasted for short-term gain in the modern world.,“Of course, I won’t change the music or lyrics. That’s out of the question,” he said, adding that what he envisions is “a vivid production that viscerally connects with today’s audiences whose lives have been captured by capitalism.”,To further modernize his opera and make it relatable to each audience member, Okada said, “I have changed Tsu’s character from being folklore’s image of a pure and innocent victim to that of an individual rejecting the temptations of capitalism and asking whether our values based on it are really right or not.”,As Kobayashi put it, “I first saw the play ‘Yuzuru’ when I was a junior high school student and Tsu became one of my dream roles. Since then I’ve seen many versions by different directors, but now I’m thinking I need to reset my image of this heroine and start to create an entirely new Tsu from scratch.,“So the challenge is how to present Okada’s new concept of ‘Yuzuru’ to the audiences. That’s what I’m wrestling with.”,“Yuzuru” will be performed on Oct. 30 at Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre in Toshima Ward, Tokyo. It will then play at Kariya City Hall in Aichi Prefecture on Jan. 30 and Kumamoto Prefectural Theater in Kumamoto Prefecture on Feb. 5.

			,Contributing writer,After its premiere at north London’s Almeida Theatre in 2019, Robert Icke’s “The Doctor” earned glowing reviews and plaudits, most notably Olivier Award nominations for best new play and best actress. However, just as it was set to take on the West End, the production was shuttered by COVID closures.,Thankfully, in Tokyo, theaters have resumed business as usual after a grueling 18 months of multiple state of emergencies, and this latest work by Icke is running now through Nov. 28 at the Parco Theatre in Shibuya. Taking on the title role of Dr. Ruth Wolff, a Jewish physician, is actress Shinobu Otake, under the direction of seasoned veteran Tamiya Kuriyama.,
,“I had a chance to see the play at the Almeida, and although I couldn’t understand everything, I was able to grasp the characters’ relationships and the story,” Otake, 64, says. “I especially enjoyed the characters’ arguments, which had a brilliant rhythm and tempo. I was also greatly impressed by the main actress Juliet Stevenson. Her acting was truly realistic, and she was so energetic and cool.”,Otake, an acting veteran with three Japan Academy Film Awards under her belt, says that while she was enthusiastically applauding the show from the front row of the cozy theater, it never occurred to her that she would be performing the lead role in Japan a couple of years later.,For “The Doctor,” Icke freely adapted Viennese author Arthur Schnitzler’s 1912 play “Professor Bernhardi,” setting the story in the modern age with a female protagonist. Ruth is the founding director of a prestigious institute specializing in Alzheimer’s disease, and one day, a 14-year-old girl comes to her needing emergency care after a self-administered abortion. When the patient’s condition becomes dire, Ruth refuses to allow a Catholic priest (Toru Masuoka) to perform last rites, on the basis that they’re unsure of the young girl’s religious beliefs and that she should be allowed to die in peace.,Soon the priest’s side of the incident goes viral on social media, putting Ruth at the center of a scandal that reveals the contending values and sexist and racist attitudes of those around her as well as the general public.,Otake says she was surprised when she read the play in preparation for the Japanese production, as the story touches upon multiple weighty topics, such as gender, religion, degenerative disease and medical ethics.,“I understand that Ruth is an intelligent, strong and independent woman, but she definitely has a weakness that doesn’t usually show at her workplace,” she says. ”It’s normal to have different versions of yourself, and I realized anew that people shouldn’t be quick to judge others because they usually have several different personalities within them at the same time.,
,
,“I suppose Ruth has confidence in herself to always make the right decision. However, even though she doesn’t intend to, she hurts people without noticing. I think that those kinds of human contradictions, namely, that people are not able to be perfect 100% of the time, is one of the very interesting points of this play.”,Although the play takes place in England and discusses issues related to race and religion that may be less familiar to Japanese audiences, Otake insists that contemporary theater provides an important opportunity for viewers to become aware of other countries’ values, lifestyles and current affairs.,“Many people in Japan today live without experiencing conflicts over religion and race,” she says. “However, through our staging of this English drama, which intricately weaves in sensitive issues such as Jewish-Christian relations, I hope audiences realize what is happening outside Japan and see how the issues of other countries are relevant to them.,“That’s why it is important to stage non-Japanese dramas, and why I want many young people to see this play.”,Otake says the key to the English production’s success was that it is grounded in reality. When she saw the play in London, she felt as though the actors were having real debates in front of her eyes. So how will she and the rest of the cast create such a realistic experience here?,“When I act as Ruth during rehearsals, I become sensitive to how the other characters react. Though someone may try to hide their real intentions, they can’t do it well instantly. So, even during the quick and aggressive conversations, I carefully observe the other person’s first and most honest reactions.,“These are the very delicate and detailed things that actors need to worry about. So I carefully pay attention to each word. Which particular word do I need to react to or be angry about? I must make that point as clear as possible to tell this story.”,In the final scene, after she has been put through the wringer, Ruth meets the priest again. He speaks to her calmly, saying, “It’s difficult to hear each other over all the history crashing around us like waves.” Ruth responds, “I feel things are ending. The postwar institutions, the postwar ideals…. (They’re) starting to crack.”,To Otake, Ruth’s words are dark but true. Although modern society is changing, it’s not necessarily for the better. “On the other hand, I believe we should find hope during dark times,” she says, referring to how the pandemic revealed society’s need for change. “Always having hope for the future, that may be our salvation.”,The best way for audiences to understand this sentiment, Otake says, is by coming to the theater and seeing the live performance.,“During the pandemic, many theaters had to move their productions online. But I want to say in a loud voice that theater must be a live performance. … ‘The Doctor’ is a very thrilling conversational drama and you may laugh at seeing humans’ twisted ways of thinking.,“I hope many people will enjoy our verbal machine-gun battle as I experienced it in London.”,“The Doctor” runs through Nov. 28 at the Parco Theater in Shibuya, Tokyo.

			,BLOOMBERG,Stephen Sondheim, whose quick-witted lyrics made Broadway audiences sit up and listen in the 1950s and whose cerebral, ground-breaking shows from “Company” in 1970 to “Merrily We Roll Along” more than a decade later thrust the American musical into the modern era, has died. He was 91.,His death was confirmed by Broadway publicist Rick Miramontez. Sondheim died in his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, the New York Times reported, citing his lawyer and friend F. Richard Pappas. Sondheim had a Thanksgiving dinner with friends the day before, the paper said. Pappas couldn’t be immediately reached in his office in Austin, Texas.,
,Coming of age between the post-World War II era dominated on Broadway by Rodgers and Hammerstein and the post-Vietnam British invasion epitomized by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sondheim created shows around urban sophisticates, a murderous barber and single-minded obsessives.,Broadway productions for which he was both composer and lyricist that won Tony awards for best musical included “Passion,” “Sweeney Todd,” and “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.” His “Sunday in the Park with George” won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.,A student of the composer Milton Babbitt and protege of the romantic lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, Sondheim wrote shows that shimmered — and sometimes shivered — in the crawlspace between sentiment and existentialism. He was, as one of his most famous lyrics put it, the quintessential “Broadway baby,” able to please an audience with rousing anthems and plangent ballads.,“One of the brightest lights of Broadway is dark tonight,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a tweet, calling Sondheim a “legend.”,He was also Broadway’s most fearless innovator, constantly staking out new musical territory, whether or not the audience could be cajoled into joining him on the journey.,Neither as popular as Rodgers and Hammerstein nor the Gershwins, and not a box-office sensation like his younger contemporary, Lloyd Webber, Sondheim nonetheless set the standard for contemporary American musicals.,“Send in the Clowns,” from 1973 Tony winner “A Little Night Music,” was arguably the only standard in his vast catalog of songs. Renditions by Judy Collins and Frank Sinatra became hits.,Others, from “The Ladies Who Lunch” (“Company”) to “I’m Still Here” (“Follies”) and “Move On” (“Sunday in the Park with George”) became mainstays of cabaret singers.,Singer Barbra Streisand, who had a Broadway album based on many of those songs, said she was grateful for the time Sondheim had to work on his music.,Sondheim also wrote songs for several films, including “Reds,” “Dick Tracy” and “The Birdcage.”,Trained as a composer, he earned his first Broadway billing as lyricist for 1957’s “West Side Story.” His far more experienced collaborators were Leonard Bernstein, who composed the music; Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book; and Jerome Robbins, who staged and choreographed the landmark show.,Two years later, he collaborated with composer Jule Styne on “Gypsy” and the result was another high point in the pantheon of Broadway musicals.,With “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” Sondheim finally got billing as both composer and lyricist. A giddy travesty of comedies by the Roman playwright Plautus that was also staged by Robbins, the hit starred Zero Mostel as a slave desperate for freedom and sex, not necessarily in that order.,But it was Sondheim’s decade-long partnership with producer-turned-director Hal Prince, beginning in 1970 with the musical comedy “Company,” that solidified his place in the first rank of Broadway visionaries.,Based on writer George Furth’s stories about a swinging single and the married couples in his life, “Company” lacked a conventional plot. Instead, it focused on the ambivalence of Bobby, the central character, as he observes the marital discord all around him.,Paradoxically, “Company” also first saw the critical divide between those who found Sondheim challenging and insightful and those who dismissed him as too intellectual for a general audience.,Still, he inspired a new generation of artists.,“Every so often someone comes along that fundamentally shifts an entire art form,” actor Hugh Jackman said. “Stephen Sondheim was one of those.”,Movie and Broadway star Idina Menzel said “we will spend our lives trying to make you proud,” while Broadway performer Lea Salonga said “we shall be singing your songs forever.”,Stephen Joshua Sondheim was born March 22, 1930, the son of Herbert Sondheim, a dress manufacturer, and his chief designer, the former Janet Fox. They lived on Manhattan’s Central Park West, until the parents divorced when he was 10.,As a youth, Sondheim became friendly with Jamie Hammerstein. In Jamie’s father, Oscar, he found a lifelong mentor. Oscar Hammerstein’s principles of lyric writing would later take on biblical significance for Sondheim even as he rebelled against the form that Hammerstein and his last great partner, composer Richard Rodgers, had themselves redefined for Broadway audiences.,Sondheim briefly attended the New York Military Academy in Cornwall, New York. At Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1950, he began studying music in earnest. Babbitt, who taught at Princeton University, later took him on as a private pupil even though he knew Sondheim wasn’t interested in becoming a “serious” composer.,Only Hal Prince was as important as Hammerstein in focusing Sondheim’s vision. Both were interested in offbeat subjects. But where Sondheim saw private little sagas, Prince saw major statements.,The sometimes fitful merging of those two intellects and approaches resulted in a new kind of “concept musical,” beginning with “Company” and extending through “Follies,” “A Little Night Music,” “Pacific Overtures,” “Sweeney Todd” and “Merrily We Roll Along.”,The commercial failure of 1981’s “Merrily We Roll Along” led to a split with Prince, who died in 2019. Sondheim’s next important collaborator was James Lapine, a young director and writer influenced by Jungian psychology and the influence of dreams.,Together they wrote “Sunday in the Park with George,” in which Sondheim acknowledged the isolation of the artistic process by telling the story of the French Pointillist painter Georges Seurat, and his muse, Marie.,They also collaborated on 1987’s “Into the Woods,” a freewheeling mash of fairy tales that became one of Sondheim’s biggest box-office successes.,“Side By Side By Sondheim” and “Putting It Together” were just two of the many shows built around Sondheim’s songs. Although he was always working on new material, Sondheim spent his last decades encouraging the growth of young artists, founding the Young Playwrights Festival.,His last new Broadway musical, also written with Lapine, was 1994’s “Passion,” based on the novel “Fosca” by I.U. Tarchetti and the subsequent Ettore Scola film, “Passione d’Amore.” The musical concerned a handsome military officer with whom a sickly woman falls all-consumingly in love.,For decades, Sondheim had stood accused of a certain aloofness and ambivalence toward love that derived from his solitariness, his homosexuality, his perfectionism and his literary conceits. “Passion” was an attempt to address that criticism.,But like so many of his shows, “Passion” left the critics, and the public, deeply divided. Despite winning the Tony, it struggled for a few months and closed without earning back its production costs.,Yet those who saw it will never forget it. That seemed to be Sondheim’s fate.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,After 15 years of entertaining audiences in Japan and abroad, the actors of Saitama Gold Theater will take the stage for the last time with “Mizu no Eki” (“The Water Station”) this month.,“I’ll miss it a lot and I’m sad that the troupe is ending, though I don’t see any alternative because we’ve all simply become much older,” says Mitsuyo Obuchi, 75, in a rehearsal room at Saitama Arts Theater in Saitama.,
,Fellow actor Toshiko Tsumura echoes that sentiment, saying, “I’m 86 now, and I think I’ve reached my personal time limit, but I feel sorry for younger members who joined when they were 55 and are only in their early 70s now. They could still do so much more. I wish we could continue, but Saitama Arts Theater has decided now’s the time to wind down the company.”,Saitama Gold Theater was founded in 2006 by renowned theater director Yukio Ninagawa, then the artistic director of Saitama Arts Theater. From the outset, his vision was to create a troupe with players aged 55 and over. Ninagawa held open auditions that attracted 1,226 applicants from across Japan, with ages ranging from 55 to 80. From there, 48 people — with an average age of 66.7 — were selected to join the company and pursue their dreams to perform as stage actors.,Obuchi remembers those early days fondly. “I thought we would be guinea pigs for an experiment by Ninagawa to get an inner circle of oldies to study theater,” she says. “I never imagined we would be the leading players in proper performances that people would pay to come and see.,“But ever since Ninagawa summoned the media to announce Saitama Gold Theater’s launch, I’ve spent the past 15 years with my mouth wide open in surprise.”,The company has indeed had an exceptional run. Besides performing throughout Japan and collaborating with leading dramatists such as Ryo Iwamatsu, Keralino Sandorovich and Shu Matsui, it also received glowing reviews and packed audiences in cities around the world, including Paris, Hong Kong and Craiova, Romania, where they performed at the International Shakespeare Festival in 2016.,However, all the accolades can’t hide the fact that many of Saitama Gold Theater’s remaining 33 actors — who were all in the original cast — are now over 80 years old. Therefore, the decision to make “Mizu no Eki” the company’s swansong was hardly unexpected, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,From Dec. 19 to 26, four men and 14 women will perform Shogo Ota’s nonverbal 1981 masterpiece, which his theater company Tenkei Gekijo toured in Australia, the United States, Canada, South Korea and several European countries before his death in 2007. Saitama Gold Theater’s staging of the play has been entrusted to rising director Kunio Sugihara, who will be working with the troupe for the first time.,“When I got this chance to direct ‘Mizu no Eki,’ I didn’t know it would be Saitama Gold Theater’s final production,” says the 39-year-old dramatist. “In fact, I wondered if I was the right person for such an important event because I was just a fan of Ninagawa’s great works.,“Then I remembered that when he founded the company he said he wanted to make a new place where mature older people could find new faces and perspectives through physical expression. Since this nonverbal play is the ultimate form of physical expression, I believe it will be appropriate for their grand finale.”,As for working with a cast of older actors, Sugihara says he’s had a positive experience and the company itself is unique.,“Saitama Gold Theater may look like a rowdy troupe of oldsters, but they are very charming and — more importantly — they’re straightforward and honest. So, even if I get tired of having to speak in a loud voice because some of them have difficulty hearing, it’s very enjoyable,” he says with a laugh.,Although the cast members are now all veteran performers, there were still some difficulties in staging a nonverbal play.,“Right from the start till the very last moment, doing a nonverbal play has been a hard challenge,” Obuchi says. “It’s actually a very fitting way to mark the end of the era of Ninagawa’s pioneering Saitama Gold Theater.”,Tsumura chuckles and adds, “Of course, I thought it was lucky this play is nonverbal because I didn’t need to remember lines. Then I realized it’s more difficult to express the story silently just with my movements.,“When the rehearsals started we repeated walking very slowly over and over. Since we’re old, it’s difficult to walk for a long time … our legs are shaky and our bodies wobble.”,“But walking is the basis of any acting,” Obuchi says, “and I am excited to be learning such fundamental things even now.”,When asked what this wordless work is about, Sugihara says it has a rough plot in which people — a girl, two men, an old lady, a man and a woman, among others — approach a dripping tap and touch or play with the water before leaving one after another.,That’s basically it. Some of them fight, others put their legs under the water and rest, and a few — including Obuchi — appear to be carrying dead bodies.,“People get to the tap to drink water and charge themselves with energy to live until tomorrow,” the actress says. “So the play is about the nature of living and sensual connections. But I think it’s also about death, and my role is to face death.”,Since the entirety of the play is expressed through mime and there are no explanations about the characters’ backgrounds, the audience members have to figure out what is going on for themselves. Although he doesn’t give away much, Sugihara offers some additional insight: “The play is about people with a sense of despair and hopelessness inside, but they get inspiration and energy from touching the fresh water.”,However, Ota is on record giving a more specific explanation of his play, saying that the work depicts the sight of returnees from Japanese-occupied China. The dramatist himself was one of those returnees, having been born in Jinan in 1939 and coming to Japan after the end of World War II.,Despite that context, the director expects this staging to be different from the production he directed with actors around his age two years ago.,“Inevitably, the despair of young people and seniors is different”, he says. “For young people, it is a craving of the heart, but when the Saitama Gold Theater actors go to the tap I can see the chronicles of their entire lives and long-term yearnings in their appearance and way of moving. I’m not making value judgments, but they’re definitely different.”,Sugihara also says he has made adjustments from Ota’s play.,“For example, I changed one scene from being a man and a woman to a female couple,” he says. “That was partly because of the gender balance of the company’s current members. If I’d done the same thing with a younger cast, it would have come across as two regular lesbians. Looking at the couple played by older actors, though, I can see their agony as a social minority whose love for each other when they were young would’ve been such a taboo, and I can imagine the hardships they would’ve gone through.”,Now, as the final curtain call draws near and Ninagawa’s great project comes to a close, the sprightly Tsumura remains positive as ever and has no intention of giving up the stage completely.,“Once, I grumbled about my performance to a friend but she urged me to keep going. She told me, ‘You are my idol’ — so I think I should keep on and do a bit more performing with the local community,” she says with a smile.,Saitama Gold Theater’s “Mizu no Eki” (“The Water Station”) runs Dec. 19 to 26 at Saitama Arts Theater in Saitama City.

			,Contributing writer,A lot of us know what it’s like to clock in for work each day and think, “I don’t know if I can make it through another day here.” Needless to say, this is a good sign that it’s time to consider finding a new job.,For the mid-career professional, however, deciding to job hunt again can be a hesitant choice. Combine that hesitation with being a non-Japanese resident during a global pandemic, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for some serious anxiety.,
,This list is designed to help you organize your thoughts if you have recently been thinking about changing jobs in Japan., This is an important question if the reason for your job change is a dislike of the industry you are currently in. However, although not impossible, reinventing yourself is easier said than done. Companies in Japan don’t often take hiring risks, which leads most job changers to keep doing what they are doing — just for a different employer. Still, you need to know the source of your dissatisfaction in order to make the right choice for your life, and it could be your current field.,However, horizontal moves to other job fields can be more difficult than moving vertically in the company or field you’re already in. So, if you’ve spent seven years as an English teacher but recently took a coding course, the Japanese job market is likely to disappoint you if you’re wanting to move into IT — ,.,The takeaway here is that you should understand your market value and understand your limitations. Be patient when seeking employment outside of your current career track., During the pandemic we’ve seen reports saying Japan’s job market is , and ,, only to later read that , than was previously hoped. This may have you wondering when the best time would be to enter the job-hunting market.,Worrying about “when” is far less important than educating yourself about “what,” however. Scanning job boards, filling out spontaneous applications, taking casual interviews in your free time and asking around your network for job leads are entirely harmless, and experts say they’re actually a healthy part of having a professional career. Always having an eye open for the dream job is the only way to spot it. “Now” is always a good time to look., If you’ve been in Japan for a while as a professional worker, you know that when engaging in , (changing jobs), ,. The human resource offices of thousands of top companies have deeply entrenched relationships with recruitment agencies in Japan, and for high-skilled, experienced, fully bilingual workers, recruiters can bring you job opportunities on a silver platter.,However, many workers naturally fall outside of many recruitment firm’s coverage, usually by being a professional in a creative or artistic field. It may be less beneficial for musicians, artists, journalists or actors to ring up most recruitment agents in Japan. These kinds of professionals tend to rely on traditional networking and want-ads on the many Japanese internet job boards, which, when used correctly, can be just as effective in seeking new employment. They include: ,, ,, ,, , (best for Japanese natives), , and ,.,Consider what is right for you., The reason you may not be feeling good in your job might be that you’re just not that into Tokyo anymore. Depending on your industry, and your financial means, it can be entirely possible to relocate to the countryside as a remote worker, and the government even ,.,Beyond remote work opportunities, ,, it’s common for English-language teachers and mechanical engineers to be able to find work in the far flung regions of Japan that need foreign-language education personnel and industrial professionals to help their shrinking communities stay relevant in the ongoing Japanese migration to urban areas., This is a difficult question for many of us. If you have lived here for a long time then you will likely find it hard to entertain the idea of leaving. For some of us, though, Japan has a shelf-life. If you are miserable at your current job and struggle to find many other job opportunities in Japan — particularly if it’s because of your language skills — then it may be the case that an overseas company can offer you the next step in your career.,Sure, deciding to leave Japan comes with its own headaches: moving during a pandemic with all the new regulations that entails, sorting out your visa, pension, taxes, apartment, bills and potentially much more. Changing jobs is a serious life choice with lasting implications for your future, so these headaches could be worth suffering though if it makes the most sense for your career. When considering a job change, the question of leaving Japan should always be on the table.,And, it’s not out of the question that you’ll be able to return. Many expats come back to Japan after some time abroad and a lot of them tend to appreciate it even more after they’ve been away for some time.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Japan is often touted as an expensive place to live. With a high quality of living, national health system, vibrant cultural scene, admirable levels of education and safety — it’s not hard to understand some of the reasons why people want to call it home. These desirable factors come at a cost, though.,The nation’s capital was recently revealed as the world’s third most-expensive city to be an expat in, according to the ,. It ranked just below Hong Kong and Ashgabat. But don’t be fooled by big claims that living in Japan, or even Tokyo, will break the bank. Like any location around the globe, there are ways to cut down on living expenses without compromising your lifestyle.,
,The impact of COVID-19 on daily lives and the economy has also changed the way we spend. Many have had their livelihoods affected, with the tourism industry, entertainment and nightlife all but decimated; job losses due to the pandemic have led to many feeling the pinch. Saving money now is perhaps more important than ever.,Looking for ways to live in Japan on a budget is about being savvy with where you spend your cash. Here are some tried and tested tips and tricks to cut back on your expenses and get those yen working for themselves.,
,The price of food and everyday items varies hugely from shop to shop. Tokyu Stores might be right opposite (or even in) your station, but that is a convenience you pay for with steep price points. Similarly, the luxury of choice afforded by fancy stores like Precce and the admittedly more economical Aeon Style means paying handsomely for the privilege.,Buying the basics at cheaper chains can result in saving a pretty penny on your purchases. Popular budget supermarkets include Gyomu Super and Hanamasa; these may not be the sleek supermarkets of your dreams, but they’re relatively cheap and actually used by small restaurants to keep their stocks replenished. Because of this they sell international basics such as pasta and bread for a snip, as well as ingredients for Mexican dishes and curries — often in bulk.,But there’s a catch. Gyomu and its ilk often carry more expensive fruits and vegetables than the larger chain stores, and this is where shopping around comes into play. Basic items — your onions, carrots and potatoes — can be picked up cheaply in places such as Life and Aeon.,
,
,Don’t overlook local , (greengrocer) joints either. These mainstays of , (shopping streets) and suburban neighborhoods are a top spot for picking up fresh produce for low prices; since they specialize in fruit and vegetables you may find things that your supermarket is lacking, plus you’ll be supporting a small independent business. Be warned: Much like turnip prices in “Animal Crossing,” real life fruit and veg prices fluctuate on the daily in Japan. Around New Year’s and other seasonal breaks price gouging does occur, so it’s wise to plan ahead.,Take full advantage of evening reductions at supermarkets when sushi or , (side dishes) are marked down, sometimes at half the price or more. Work out the time your local supermarket starts reducing their freshly made meals and you’ll be in for a treat. Learn the kanji for half price, , (半額) which is often pasted on packaging or signs.,Living outside of the cities can also mean far fewer options in terms of supermarkets and yaoya. A tip I picked up when living in the , (countryside) was to get my groceries delivered weekly. This way I was able to save on the cost of transport and keep an eye on my spending by planning meals in advance.,
,Finding the extra cash you budget for entertainment isn’t always easy — the cost quickly adds up. Tickets for events can be expensive, as can meals in , (Japanese pubs), cinema tickets and weekends away, but treating yourself in your downtime doesn’t need to cost the Earth.,Museums in Tokyo and across the country usually have reduced-rate and free days throughout the year, some of them at least once a month. Check websites for when those are.,However, not all museums and art galleries charge entrance; there’s a whole selection of cultural centers where you can easily while away an hour or two free of charge. These include , and ,, an arts and cultural center set in a former junior high school. Similarly, city views can be found for free at observation decks in multiple skyscrapers across the land: there’s , (Setagaya, Tokyo); , in Bancho, Niigata; and the 16th-floor garden of , in Osaka, to name a few.,Festivals are another free activity that you can join in with. These happen throughout the year in towns and cities and can help you ingratiate with Japanese culture. For example, it costs nothing to join in at a ,, the cyclical dance at o-Bon festivals in summer. Also in the warmer months, parks and green spaces across the country become hangouts for people of all ages. Ease into the parklife: lay out a rug, bring a frisbee (or a book) and spend a free afternoon soaking up the local life.,Another option is to simply make the most of interesting historical sights and architecture by taking yourself on a walk; plan your route on a maps app and spend the day hitting up locations that pique your interest. Local councils will also often provide free maps with walks around interesting sites in the area, often along routes marked with signs or tiles. Being creative with the way you spend your money on entertainment can pay dividends.,
,Traveling around Japan’s urban areas is not cheap, but there are clever ways to streamline how much you pay for a trip.,Before you hop on a train, check Google maps for different routes. The cost of the trip is shown in yen for each route suggested; you can also change your search preferences to include cheaper routes. Sometimes, depending on where you’re traveling to, you can save tens or hundreds on a journey. It all adds up. If you have time on longer journeys, opt for slower local trains instead of shinkansen and save yourself thousands.,
,
,Riding the train is not always the best option. In fact, city buses can get you from A to B for a flat fare: ¥210 (¥206 with an IC card) in Tokyo can ferry you practically all the way across the city on some routes. Again, checking a maps app can help with planning. Traveling on the reliable , for long distances will also save you a whole stack of cash when compared to the shinkansen. Night buses can even save on accommodation for the night: the average fare for a night bus from Tokyo to Osaka, for example, is around ¥3,500.,For traveling locally, using pedal power will really save you time and money. Secondhand bikes can be picked up for a low rate, or , gives the option of using electric bikes to get around town.,
,Across the country loyalty schemes are king. Peek into anybody’s wallet and they’ll be crammed full of various plastic cards for different supermarkets, coupons for restaurants and loyalty cards for coffee shops. These money-saving tactics are a big deal in Japan and are well worth spending some of your time researching and investing in.,It’s possible to be deftly savvy. Using specific bank cards or prepaid chargeable point cards at the correct food joints and , (convenience stores) means you’ll tot up a healthy balance of T-Points, Nanaco points and a whole array of other points to get cash off purchases. Loyalty really is rewarded.,Don’t turn down stamp or , (sticker) cards at your local coffee shop or bakery, either. There are also coupons that will give you money off bowls of udon, free drink at cafes or half-price meals at family restaurants. Check online for the latest deals and see if you can save; download apps for your favorite haunts and open up a world of coupons.,
,One of the biggest expenses of any monthly budget is bills. Electricity, gas, water, internet, phone: There’s no getting away from it. In the winter months, electricity bills can soar as we all try to keep cozy in the cold weather. Using an AC unit is one of the most common but more expensive ways to heat your living space. However, you can cut costs by using eco mode, making sure the vents point down, keeping the temperature at 20 degrees Celsius and using a floor fan to move the warm air around. More energy friendly ways to stay warm include using a , or a heated carpet, both of which are some of the most cost-effective ways to stay warm: One study suggests that these cost an estimated ¥4.3 and ¥9 per hour, respectively, to run.,In the sweltering height of summer, air conditioning is a must. It’s also a surefire way to hike up an expensive energy bill. Try to use it only when it’s needed, and use tactical ways of staying cool like taking brief cold showers, strategic fan placement and opening windows when temperatures cool down. Use a timer for the aircon so it turns off once you go to sleep.,When it comes to drying clothes, hang them up to dry outside. Because of dry winter air and sunny days, clothes can dry outside during the freezing depths of Japan’s winter months; you’ll be saving a whole lot of money on energy bills and doing your bit to help the planet, too.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Clickbait headlines like “Get a free house in the Japanese countryside!” have popped up over the past several years — and while the idea of moving into an old home in bucolic rural Japan sounds amazing in theory, the reality is more complex. Nonetheless, a number of factors have collided recently to create unique opportunities in the housing market for foreign residents of Japan.,
,Japan’s slowly but steadily rising prices, openness to foreign investors, excellent architects and infrastructure for house building — and an increase of resources and agencies for acquiring ,, or abandoned, often ultra-cheap homes — have combined to make Japan an attractive environment for non-Japanese looking to acquire real estate, be it a primary home, secondary home or investment.,According to reporting on ,, Japan house prices increased 0.8% in 2020 year over year, a shockingly modest increase compared to other highly developed countries — for example, , in the U.S. in 2020. And while the pandemic has weakened demand overall, Alex Toyoda at ,, a Tokyo-based real estate company, says that while foreigners are scarce due to the pandemic, the market hasn’t changed much due to the increasing demands of wealthy Japanese.,“Shutting the borders completely closed off foreigners from entering the country,” Toyoda says. “But to our surprise, the market for expats has barely changed because of the increasing demand from Japanese. And where we’ve lost expats in the rental market, the buying and selling market has been very strong.”,Some buyers have turned toward searching for larger homes with an extra bedroom for an office or a pet-friendly apartment, but the overall market hasn’t drastically altered.,“Residential property lending has not skipped a beat and has been very healthy throughout the pandemic,” confirms Adam German at ,, a guide to Tokyo real estate.,On the other hand, COVID-19 has caused rents in the struggling hospitality, restaurant and retail industries to decrease, but most housing markets have remained largely unharmed by the pandemic.,“Housing focused on foreigners is a unique, high-end industry,” Toyoda says. “Most of the buyers are looking for their own homes, seeking a better environment. Most people are focused on Japanese housing not for the investment, but for themselves.”,Since implementation in 2012, the reflationary policies of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, known as “Abenomics,” have buoyed the housing market. As a result, the market has seen modest price growth, changing Japanese real estate from a deflationary asset to a growing one. The change has spurred investments in Japanese real estate from wealthy investors throughout Asia.,
,Japanese and specifically Tokyo real estate prices are very low compared to those of cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore and London, so buyers from wealthy countries have taken advantage of Japan’s relatively low real estate prices and high yields. A weaker yen has also encouraged foreign buyers. (Since 2012, one dollar has gone from ¥80 to nearly ¥110.),“Ninety percent of wealthy Asian clients buy as an investment,” says Mitsuo Hashimoto at ,, another Tokyo-based real estate firm. “There’s a lot of interest in high-rise buildings in central Tokyo. This central market used to be dominated by expats, but after the market crash in 2008, more wealthy Japanese started to move into the market, especially with stocks and prices increasing since 2012. It’s a healthy rise — not like a bubble.”,Hashimoto also notes that many foreign companies stopped paying moving expenses for expats after ’08 and turned to hiring foreign workers that were already based in Japan. This has led to more expats renting and buying outside of central Tokyo and moving further into the suburbs.,“I still recommend our clients to buy as central as they can, because those residences will appreciate the most in value,” Hashimoto says.,While prices and demand in the housing market have remained steady and slowly growing in recent years, residential construction has plunged, mostly due to Japan’s massive supply glut. An extremely limited supply of the types of housing preferred by many non-Japanese — larger, more spacious, open-plan homes — has further forced expat renters and buyers farther out of central Tokyo.,“The supply is very scarce for top-end properties, while there’s an endless supply of smaller studios,” Toyoda says. “Construction just isn’t fast enough to meet the demand.”,
,
,Still, the Tokyo market has managed to avoid some of the disastrous housing trends that have struck other major cities.,“If you look at New York, London and Singapore, you have foreign buyers paying very high prices, so prices in the central area go up because of foreign investors,” says Hashimoto. This trend has notably led to gentrification and displacement of locals.,But Hashimoto says he doesn’t see the same trend manifesting in Tokyo, even as more investors capitalize on Tokyo real estate. “Central Tokyo is very large compared to central Hong Kong or New York City. I think the market will still be dominated by local people in Tokyo.”,The current picture of the Japanese housing market is a lot of hustle and bustle around the top, high-end properties, and a massive supply glut for the rest. And while the focus of real estate companies remains at a high-income level — expats, Asian investors and wealthy Japanese — the supply glut presents opportunities for Japan’s large middle class, as well.,“The middle class has arguably been the least affected by recent real estate trends,” says Hashimoto, “since those employed at big companies have stable salaries and protection.”,
, are one such opportunity. With the population of Japan in decline, there is a surplus of abandoned homes around the country. The Japanese government has started to put some abandoned houses and apartments back on the market and, in 2017, , to make vacant homes available to rent, but the initiative failed to attract homeowners. Still, companies and services have emerged as of late to help prospective buyers take advantage of these homes.,“(Akiya) started as a quirky thing which was then proven viable, then somewhat desirable, then recently valuable with the onset of coronavirus,” says Matt Ketchum of ,, a real estate company focused on akiya and rural homes.,The biggest challenge, besides the state of disrepair that many of these homes have fallen into, is that often, akiya do not have updated legal heirs. If the title deed to a house shows someone who was born in the 19th century, chasing down their legal descendants and buying the property can prove to be practically impossible.,“The main reason why attractive akiya don’t move is because they’re locked away behind an anachronistic bureaucratic system that is generally impenetrable to the layperson,” Ketchum says. “So once we find you something that looks nice … engage professional services unless you are extremely confident in your ability to navigate rural real estate agencies’ idiosyncratic methods.”,Companies like Akiya & Inaka and government initiatives such as the Akiya Bank Program have started to turn akiya from an idea into a reality. Experts recommend using exclusively established listings to ensure that a house is actually available for sale and doing extremely thorough due diligence.,Ketchum says that the pandemic has further helped spark interest in these homes. Compared to the high expenses and long time frame of building a custom home, akiya can realistically come in at under ¥20 million.,“Then there are the health, financial, workstyle and lifestyle benefits of extricating oneself from the city center,” says Ketchum. As resources continue to increase for akiya, they appear to be a viable option for foreign residents with either lower budgets or greater flexibility, especially as support for purchasing them continues to rise.,
,For those with larger budgets or more specific requirements for their home, Japan’s expansive house-building industry presents exciting opportunities for foreign residents. Ryoma Katsura, CEO and founder of ,, a company that specializes in connecting foreigners with Japanese architects, says that the quality and flexibility provided by Japanese architects has made house-building an attractive option for foreign residents who are settling down in Japan for the long term.,“Clients are usually very satisfied with architects’ understanding of what they want and creativity and expertise in realizing it,” Katsura says. “People want to build their houses in Japan with all their wishes assembled together as places to live in that they love.”,, a retirement advisor focusing on foreign residents at ,, says that it is important for foreigners to differentiate buying a home from buying real estate for investment purposes.,“While land can hold its value, many homes end up worthless or with negative value,” Tanaka says.,However, he points out that Japanese financing options make buying a smart financial decision for people settling down in one place for the long term.,“Because of low interest rates, a mortgage will often be a lower monthly payment than rent, for a more comfortable/luxurious home. If you are able to live in the same home for decades … you will pay less and enjoy a higher standard of living. However, every time you move you will pay transaction costs of 5-10%, as well as seeing the value of the building go down.”,The Japanese housing market, while presenting unique opportunities, also has distinct challenges for foreign residents. For example, there is the ever-surprising key money for rentals, an extra fee that serves as a gift to the owner. There are also “right of residence” laws that heavily protect renters. These laws mean that owners tend to have extremely stringent requirements and background checks for renters, which has led to widespread housing discrimination against non-Japanese. In the buying market, those purchasing apartments should conduct thorough due diligence because , has shown that some real estate companies do not disclose information about land quality and severely underestimate the cost for repairs and maintenance.,Overall, slow but steady market growth and a wealth of resources make the current housing market attractive for foreign residents.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Anyone staying in Japan on a short- or long-term basis needs a roof over their head. Residents have two basic options — rent accommodation or purchase property, with the latter option offering the possibility of renovating an older home to bring it up to the standards of modern living, especially in terms of insulation.,
,Obviously, a lot can be said about any of these choices. Just remember that all three options mentioned below have pitfalls associated with them, and how well you navigate your final decision may ultimately determine how well you enjoy your time in Japan.,
,Japan’s housing market is flooded with an abundance of small, one-bedroom apartments. On the plus side, this means that prices are low, and there’s no need to share with a roommate. On the flip side, however, this also means there’s a shortage of the more spacious, multiroom apartments foreign residents tend to prefer.,“With the number of expats increasing and the number of properties decreasing, foreigners have now been going into the suburbs because they cannot find homes in their favorite areas,” says Alex Toyoda at Tokyo-based real estate company ,.,Many of these single-bedroom apartments can be found in central neighborhoods. However, those looking for larger family homes will be faced with a much smaller, more limited market, located farther away from their offices and favorite weekend haunts. Many will be tempted to downsize their living expectations in order to save a little money on rent and live in the best possible location.,One of the biggest differences when renting in Japan compared to other countries is that the government has passed a number of strict laws that protect tenants. For the most part, owners essentially cannot kick tenants out and, as a result, anyone renting accommodation will probably have to go through a very stringent screening process before being offered a tenancy contract. Some owners have used this system to discriminate against foreign tenants (which I’ll discuss in more detail in the next installment).,Many experts recommend using an agency that specializes in renting to foreign tenants, as they know which properties do and do not accept non-Japanese.,“You’ll have to submit all kinds of documents when applying,” Toyoda says. “It’s difficult to get in, but once you’re in your apartment, you’re protected by law.”,There are several factors to consider when looking for an apartment.,Orientation is critical and south-facing apartments are by far the most in-demand, offering space to dry futons all year round as well as savings on electricity for heating, laundry, lighting and more.,Construction materials also make a big difference in sound insulation in apartment complexes with a lot of people living in them. Concrete is much better for noise insulation compared to wood or steel. Experts also recommend checking for mold, which can become a serious threat during Japan’s humid summers.,
,Japan’s large construction market provides foreign residents with sizable budgets plenty of opportunity to build a home.,This begins with a search for land, which Ryoma Katsura, CEO and founder of ,, a company that specializes in connecting foreign buyers with Japanese architects, says can often be the most challenging part of the process.,“It’s important to get a professional involved early, because you never know when the land you want pops up,” Katsura says. “Things get sold really quickly.”,Three types of people can design your homes: individual architects, large construction companies and local builders.,The latter two can have faster timelines and offer some level of cost-savings, but invariably provide less customization.,By comparison, individual architects can offer more flexibility and have a better understanding of what non-Japanese clients are looking for in their homes.,“If Japanese people have space, they tend to build a wall and turn it into another room to prioritize functionality,” Katsura says. “That doesn’t necessarily fit other culture’s priorities.”,Katsura says many of his firm’s non-Japanese clients tend to be satisfied with their Japanese architects. For example, Japanese houses often use wood in ways that aren’t common in many other countries, while rooftop balconies have become a popular solution for those seeking open space within the confines of a Japanese home.,“Japanese architecture and design tends to be very modern, but simple, and sophisticated,” Katsura says. “Architects are also very knowledgeable about the seasons, designing houses to maximize heating and cooling with various approaches, including choosing the right materials and structures or placing windows and eaves in the most optimal way.”,It’s important to note that financing and mortgage options will depend on your residency status. In addition, having to navigate language barriers can pose issues, but that’s where professionals can assist as facilitators.,
,Japan is believed to have more than 8 million empty homes (,) nationwide.,While you might come across empty homes in your neighborhood that pique your interest, they’re actually very difficult to acquire in the first place as it’s often hard to track down the owner.,Keeping an eye on established portals such as the Akiya Bank Program is probably the best approach and, as more companies start to specialize in selling empty homes, the number of options can only increase.,Parker Allen, co-founder of ,, a real estate company specializing in empty homes, sees long-term potential in the marketplace.,“Just last year it was announced that UNESCO would recognize Japanese architectural craftsmanship as an intangible heritage, and for good reason,” Allen says. “The , technique, which is Japan’s traditional and primary building technique for wooden structures, is extremely solid and can stand the test of time.”,On the downside, such engineering techniques mean that possibilities for design are more limited.,“We advise clients that they need to be comfortable with the current floor plan and overall design,” Allen says.,What empty homes lack in design possibilities, they often make up for in craftsmanship — not to mention the huge cost-savings compared to custom builds.,One of the most important factors to consider when looking for an empty home to renovate is a desire to relocate to a more rural location. And once the renovation work on the home has been completed, more work is still needed to ensure foreign residents are able to live in these communities according to Matt Ketchum, co-founder of Akiya & Inaka.,“It starts with removing barriers to entry from curious, creative individuals from all walks of life,” he says, “encouraging them to experiment as they see fit and with the support of local communities.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,When Yoshihide Suga declared in October that Japan would be carbon neutral by 2050, he became the first Japanese prime minister to set a specific timeline in the country’s bid to become emissions free.,As ambitious as Suga’s pledge may be, it’s far from being a pipe dream. The world is slowly taking concrete steps to address the climate crisis, and Japan simply can ill afford to sit on the sidelines any longer.,
,Japan is as vulnerable to climate change as any other country in the world. Its 2019 typhoon season was the costliest on record, closely followed by 2018. What’s more, scorching heat waves hospitalized thousands across the country in 2018 and 2019, while record rainfall in this period forced millions to evacuate from their homes.,“Typhoons that are supposed to (make landfall) only once in 100 years seem to be striking Japan every year,” says Soma Kondo, a spokesperson for Climate Youth Japan. “I think any more damage will have the entire country concerned about global warming.”,Many of these aspects of climate change are no longer projections, but realities. In 2018, the Environment Ministry reported that annual temperatures recorded in Japan are, than the global average — and that the archipelago gets an extra day of “heat wave” weather once every five years. The report noted more days of heavy precipitation, fewer days of rain overall and a snow depth reduction of about 13% per decade.,
,
,It has recently become evident just how deep the consequences of climate change run in Japan, cutting deeply into the fabric of the country’s economy and society. The economic consequences of the climate crisis in Japan include storms that bring ruin to local infrastructure and businesses, and climate-related agricultural damage to pillars of regional economies and cultural pride such as rice, fresh produce and seafood.,The most dramatic consequence of the climate crisis comes in the form of increased rainfall and powerful typhoons. Annual instances of extreme precipitation in Japan have ,, and it has certainly felt that way: Between Typhoon Lan in 2017, Typhoon Jebi in 2018, Typhoon Hagibis in 2019, and torrential rain that caused millions to evacuate in western Japan in 2018 and Kyushu in 2017, 2019 and 2020, the impact has been nothing short of devastating. In 2019, damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis exceeded ¥1.8 trillion, a record for a water-caused natural disaster that wasn’t related to a tsunami. The previous record was the heavy rain recorded in Okayama and western Japan in 2018.,“Everything (is at risk),” says Miguel Esteban, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Waseda University. “From an engineering point of view, it would probably be better to move everybody out of this country and resettle them elsewhere.”,Tropical storms form as a consequence of heat and so, generally speaking, the hotter the weather, the, Studies, global warming has increased the proportion of severe tropical storms around the world.,
,
,Most of the economic damage during such storms occurs to infrastructure and buildings. Last summer, , killed 64, forced 200,000 residents to evacuate, caused 105 rivers to overflow, 316 mudslides, and, according to Kumamoto prefecture, monetary damage of more than ¥556 billion. The area around the Kuma River was particularly hard-hit, with houses and bridges being swept away.,“Heavy rain in Kumamoto in recent years has caused major floods and landslides,” says Toshio Fujimi, a professor of engineering at Kumamoto University’s Center for Water Cycle, Marine Environment and Disaster Management. “As a result, we have seen heavy damage to major roads and agriculture by sediment flowing into farmland, as well as the destruction of dams and reservoirs.”,There is also a ripple effect on local businesses and the local economy. In November 2019, Nikkei, had significantly disrupted the tourist season in Hakone, cutting off mountain railway services as well as spring water to hotels and inns. Fujimi anticipates that Kumamoto will suffer from the same problem, as tourists shy away from visiting disaster-struck regions.,Even the temporary suspension of a bullet train can cast a long shadow over local economies in the nearby region.,“Tourist numbers have been slow to recover, even after the bullet train resumed operation,” Tateki Ataka, president of Hokkoku Bank in Ishikawa, told Nikkei Asia after Hagibis. “It seems that tourists remain reluctant to make trips as the impact of the typhoon lingers.”,
,
,And while rising sea levels in Japan don’t pose an immediate problem to many of the country’s residents, the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that, to protect infrastructure and coastlines against a 1-meter rise in sea levels. And, as if that’s not enough, replacing infrastructure that is damaged by storms every year is difficult enough without having to set financial resources aside to fight COVID-19.,“The river flood defenses in Tokyo are currently being upgraded to withstand 1-in-200-year events,” Esteban says. “Adaptation is much cheaper than leaving things vulnerable.”,In a 2016 study, Esteban and his team calculated that the cost of inaction could exceed ¥100 trillion in damage, compared to the ¥370 billion investment required to upgrade Tokyo’s infrastructure to defend the city against storm surges and rising sea levels.,
,
,The climate crisis has also already led to changes for some of Japan’s most important agricultural products — first and foremost, rice.,When growing rice, high temperatures can cause white immature grain as well as cracked grain by reducing starch production and breaking apart the husk. The Environment Ministry reported that cases of both white immature grain and cracked grain have been increasingly seen around Japan — as well as a reduction in yield in unusually warm years. As early as 2012, 25 prefectures had already reported an increase in rice grain damage.,JA Oita, the regional cooperative of farms in Oita Prefecture, says that high temperatures and irregular, but extreme, rainfall have combined to make last year extremely poor in terms of a rice yield.,“The quality of the rice has deteriorated because the night temperature does not drop due to global warming,” says Yasunori Hitomi, a representative from JA Oita. “The number of ears of rice is also decreasing because of less rainfall overall. As a result, the rice-crop index of Oita Prefecture last year was 77, compared to the national average of 98.”,Extreme heat’s effects on rice quality and yields can have knock-on business consequences. When actual shipments don’t match the projected yields, the balance of supply and demand is disrupted, causing over- or under-supply and unexpected competition between different regions.,“We haven’t been able to make shipments according to our plan, so our prices won’t rise,” Hitomi says.,Projections suggest that 30% decreases in rice yields for most of Japan outside of Hokkaido and Tohoku are possible in the next 50 years.,Rising temperatures are also having consequences on fruit. The Environment Ministry has reported that high temperatures and low summer precipitation has caused damage to grapes, apples, persimmons, oranges and peaches., showed that negative effects of high temperatures have been observed in Nagano Prefecture, and predicted that the climate would be too warm to grow apples in the country by 2060. Farmers cited in the study were particularly concerned in the short-term over paler colored apples, which drastically lower prices, since the Japanese market highly values colorful fruit. Nagano farmers described earlier blooming as well as higher fall temperatures, later frosts and more hail storms — events all linked to the climate crisis.,Katsutoshi Osanai of JA Aomori says that high September and October temperatures are inhibiting the ripening of their apples and even burning the fruit.,“We haven’t seen large impacts on our vegetables yet, but the mild winter snowfalls … (are) definitely a different climate from the old Aomori Prefecture,” Osanai says.,Storms can also bring devastation to farmers, such as when, to crops such as rice, apples and cucumbers.,
,
,The climate crisis is further beginning to have effects on Japan’s fisheries. Jorge Molinos, a professor at the Arctic Research Center at Hokkaido University, who studies the effects of the climate crisis on the marine ecosystem, says that climate change is causing a rapid reorganization of marine life by relocating species within warming oceans.,Japan’s unique geography puts temperate waters in contact with tropical waters. Fish are sensitive to changes in temperature, so tropical species are pushing north.,“Tropical herbivorous fish, which are arriving in increasing numbers to the temperate costs of Shikoku or Kyushu are putting extra pressure on temperate seaweed, posing a serious threat to these valuable ecosystems,” Molinos says. “The tropicalization in Japan has many faces, like the expansion of tropical coral reefs … or the population decline of temperate species.”,Challenges for the fishing industry have emerged all over the country, from Hokkaido’s salmon, Pacific saury and squid catches to the disappearance of abalone and anchovies in Tokyo Bay. While difficult to link directly to climate change, the salmon catch has, in the past 15 years.,“The fishing industry is very concerned,” says Shinichi Ito, a professor at the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at Tokyo University. “Higher water temperatures are causing problems for nori and ,(seaweed).”,Large-scale losses of seaweed cultivation grounds were previously observed in Kyushu and Yamaguchi Prefecture in 2013. Then, in last year’s summer, local divers and fishers in, Tropical reefs were first confirmed in Kanto waters as recently as 2007.,“With the loss of the seaweed beds, large abalone, which were our local specialty, died out,” Koichi Hirashima, head of a local fisher’s association tells Kyodo News. Hirashima says that it has also become nearly impossible to catch anchovies and cherry bass in February due to higher ocean temperatures.,Adaptation to the climate crisis is possible and already underway. Farmers around Japan have even changed crops to get by. In the Nanyo region of Ehime Prefecture,,, which can tolerate higher levels of summer heat. On the islands and coastal areas of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, farmers have, to cope with warmer climates. A sake brewery that operated in Nakatsugawa, Gifu, for nearly 150 years recently,“The colder the weather is, the better the quality of sake,” Koji Yamada, president and master brewer of the company tells the Asahi Shimbun. “This is an issue we must resolve over the next 100 years.”,
,
,Hokkaido fishing operators, already suffering from poor salmon hauls and encountering inedible sunfish for the first time ever, are rapidly changing to yellowtail and even bluefin tuna in order to stay afloat.,“Yellowtail is an important fishery item mainly in southern Japan,” says Naoki Kumagai, a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies. “When it started to be caught in Hokkaido, it was (worthless). Now however, yellowtail has been priced well also in Hokkaido.”,But the cultural loss cannot be quantified. The indigenous Ainu people had 133 words for salmon, the crucial ingredient in Hokkaido’s beloved sashimi rice bowl. Fishing operators can catch yellowtail instead, but what is Hokkaido without salmon?,To protect their apple trees, farmers in Nagano Prefecture delay harvests and place reflective materials on the ground. But even these measures can’t prevent severe typhoons from,, much like Hagibis did two years ago. Nagano Prefecture is highly prized for its apples, and currently contributes to 18% of the national harvest. What is Nagano Prefecture without apples?,Thus, the climate crisis has begun to threaten long-standing regional specialties and local culture. The prices and accessibility of fish, fruit, grain and vegetables may create consequential changes in the economic and cultural life and image of regions around Japan.,
,
,Climate change, with its challenges, brings opportunities for innovation. The Environment Ministry reported on the growth of agriculture support services and technologies to improve the heat tolerance of buildings.,“The past few years have seen Japan’s national resilience — green infrastructure, smart city and other initiatives — turned into platforms that specifically link national agencies, subnational governments, business and civil society,” says Andrew DeWit, a professor of economics at Rikkyo University. “These partnerships have seen growth rates of several hundred percent over the past year.”,The larger problem is that Japan’s climate policy, despite Suga’s ambitious declaration, remains in limbo. After the 1992 Kyoto Protocol, Japan’s climate strategy was based on nuclear energy. However, following the nuclear meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant in 2011, Japan deactivated all of its nuclear reactors — and,. This shift led to a decade of resurgent fossil fuel use in the 2010s. Combined with stagnation in renewable growth, Japan is far from reducing emissions targets that align with the Paris agreement’s objectives.,“Since the Environment Ministry is in charge of climate change policy, measures are limited to homes and offices, and there is no energy or transportation policy,” says Kenrou Taura, a representative from Kiko Network, a Kyoto-based climate organization. “Many of the policies have further convinced people that measures against climate change are inconvenient and inhibit economic growth.”,
,
,Now, climate change itself is inhibiting economic growth, affecting infrastructure, rice, fruit, fisheries — and livelihoods — across Japan.,“We do not disregard individual efforts to be eco-friendly, but we believe there is a need for major social and economic changes,” Taura says. “We need adaptation and mitigation measures for each region, and information and educational programs to promote the participation and understanding of residents. Raising CO2 reduction targets should be given top priority.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The amount of plastic produced worldwide each year could fill every skyscraper in New York. Of the 380 million tons of plastic produced annually, only 1% is biodegradable or made from renewable natural sources rather than fossil fuels. This represents a small, but growing portion of the market.,While alternatives to petroleum-based plastic are still in their infancy in Japan, a number of forward-looking manufacturers are investing in these materials, notwithstanding the initial challenges of such innovations. They hope to make a dent in the ever-growing Japanese market, where plastic production has increased steadily from 7,518 tons in 1980 to 10.67 million tons in 2018.,
,Such burgeoning numbers contrast with the stigma surrounding plastic, a term commonly used to describe a vast array of polymers — long molecules made up of shorter ones — used to mass-produce consumer goods.,A global campaign against plastic pollution in the oceans has gained considerable momentum, galvanizing public outrage against a class of materials whose fundamental flaw — it’s not biodegradable — is putting the health of entire ecosystems at risk.,
,
,Evidence of plastic pollution is increasing not only in rivers, lakes and marine environments, with the weight of plastic in the ocean projected to exceed that of fish by 2050, but also on land and in organisms, including humans.,For all its merits, including its malleability, strength and durability, fossil-based plastic is inefficient. For example, 95% of plastic packaging’s aggregate value is lost after a single use. We extract oil and gas from the Earth to produce synthetic polymers, transform them into products often designed to be used only once — a third of plastic produced in 2017 was single-use — and then throw them away.,“An object that becomes waste has a quality problem. Tackling it is an opportunity for innovation,” says chemist Michael Braungart, pioneer of the “cradle to cradle” model in which products are designed to turn into nutrients rather than waste.,
,
,Polymers can also be made from natural materials such as cellulose from plants and using natural processes such as microorganism fermentation. They can be biodegradable or compostable (overlapping but distinct properties) and designed to be reused and recycled — or even eaten.,The possibility of manufacturing materials that mirror the properties of conventional plastic but whose life cycle has a lower — sometimes positive — environmental impact has opened what could become a revolutionary frontier.,
,Four years ago, when Material ConneXion Tokyo organized its first Sustainable Materials exhibition, CEO Kumiko Yoshikawa recalls how the company, which connects product and material manufacturers, struggled to find suitable examples created by Japanese manufacturers.,Since then, the exhibition has grown at pace with interest in this field. Prominent among the projects on display in the 2020 edition, held in the Tokyo library where Material ConneXion stores more than 3,000 materials, were alternatives to oil-derived plastic. These included a yarn made from wood pulp, a compostable plastic and a plant-based polymer developed by Japan’s largest chemical corporation, Mitsubishi Chemical.,Plastic processing producer Sekisui Chemical and manufacturer Sumitomo Chemical provide another example of such progress. They have partnered to use ethanol made by gasifying combustible waste (a technology developed by Sekisui and U.S. startup LanzaTech) to produce polyolefin, a type of polymer used in products ranging from toys to clear films. The pilot project kicks off in 2022 and the market launch is expected for 2025.,Repurposing waste is one of the basic tenets of the “circular economy.” This model seeks to replace a linear system, in which raw materials are made into objects that then become garbage, into one better represented by a loop, whereby materials are recycled or reused over and over again.,This is the prevailing approach of alternatives to fossil-based plastic. However, such a universal philosophy has yet to catch on in Japan, Yoshikawa says.,“In Japan the circular economy isn’t being adopted on a wide scale and there isn’t even much awareness of the term,” she says.,Still, a number of home-grown companies are beginning to embrace its principles.,
,
,Keita Yanase works for Marubeni, one of Japan’s largest trading companies. He came up with the idea for Edish, a line of disposable, compostable tableware made from food waste and paper pulp, and won a company prize for it.,“Many of Marubeni’s customers are in the food sector, so it’s easy to source waste,” Yanase points out, specifying that Edish cups, plates and containers are made from discarded bran, coffee, bamboo, tea, apples or mandarin oranges using paper pulp molding machines, a widely available technology.,The brand was launched in 2020, initially targeting events. However, the halt on mass gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic shifted its focus to the food takeout and delivery market.,Agricultural products are a good example of the kind of raw materials suitable for alternatives to petroleum-derived polymers, though attention must be paid to how they’re sourced. The environmental devastation wrought by industrial agriculture, for instance, has been compared to that of fossil fuel extraction.,“To be truly sustainable, materials must have an inexhaustible supply of carbon and the energy for production and processing should come from renewable sources,” says James Elliott, a professor of macromolecular materials science at the University of Cambridge and co-leader of S2UPPlant, a research project which aims to supplant fossil-based plastics with materials made from plants whose genetics have been modified or which are blended with agricultural waste. “Fossil fuels aren’t sustainable because the carbon source is finite and isn’t readily accessible in the biosphere. If you extract and release it, whatever you do — unless you bury it deep in the ground again — you’ve net emitted carbon.”,
,
,Plastic production and incineration generate around 400 million tons of carbon dioxide globally every year (more than six times Tokyo’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2017). In Japan, 30 million tons of fossil resources are used annually to make plastic.,Some of the world’s largest plastic manufacturers are oil and gas companies.,“They’re making big investments in plastic because they’re projected to lose oil demand as pushes to decarbonize the economy continue,” says Hiroaki Odachi, who leads Greenpeace Japan’s plastic campaign.,While synthetic polymer production currently accounts for a tenth of global fossil fuel consumption, this proportion could double by 2050 as plastic production is also expected to double in the next 20 years.,Cutting dependence on plastic and fossil fuels are two sides of the same coin.,“Fossil-based plastics are currently cheaper than bio-based alternatives, but that’s because the hidden costs aren’t factored in,” Elliott says. “I’m not an economist but I see no reason in principle why sustainable plastics couldn’t be as cheap as synthetic ones once produced on the same scale.”,
,
,Japan’s citizens each consumed an average of 35 kilograms of plastic packaging — which accounts for nearly half of plastic waste globally — in 2014, second only to the United States.,“The culture of , (Japanese hospitality) may be contributing to this, as wrapping is considered a part of service,” Odachi says. “(But) we can’t prove how much cultural aspects are behind plastic use.”,The rampant consumption of disposable goods, which is fueling plastic pollution, isn’t a problem confined to Japan, Odachi says. Instead, it is the symptom of an industrialized, fossil-based economic system.,Camino, a Japanese product and service provider focused on sustainability, launched Paplus in 2019. The material is made with recycled paper pulp and polylactic acid, a biodegradable bioplastic derived from fermented plant starch from crops such as corn and of which Japanese companies are some of the biggest global producers. Paplus pellets can be molded into reusable objects such as drink tumblers, trays and cosmetics containers.,The focus on reusable products is important.,“If we just replace plastic with more environmentally responsible materials but rubbish actually increases, is this really an alternative?” asks Camino CEO Koichiro Fukasawa. “I believe we need to rethink our lifestyles, which are hugely and unnecessarily dependent on disposable plastic.”,Alternatives to conventional plastic can’t simply be new materials that substitute old ones,Fukasawa says. Rather, a range of strategies must be adopted in the way products are made, designed, used and, ultimately, thrown out.,
,
,The Osaka Blue Ocean Vision adopted at the Group of 20 Summit in Osaka in 2019 aims to eliminate additional marine plastic pollution by 2050. The Japanese government will soon launch a domestic version of this program to realize this goal with the cooperation of local governments, the private sector and nongovernment organizations.,Under the program, cleanup initiatives and alternative materials will be promoted, together with recycling of marine plastic litter.,Recycling is considered one of Japan’s fortes in managing plastic waste, of which it generated almost 9 million tons in 2018. Eighty-four percent of this was recycled.,However, plastic recycling often involves a process of downcycling, whereby some of the original value and properties of the material are lost. In Japan, 56% of plastic recycled in 2018 was destined for “energy recovery” — that is, when incinerated to become energy, such materials leave a void to be filled by virgin raw materials to make new products.,
,
,In addition, 23% was recycled mechanically (as opposed to chemically), which involves remelting waste to make new things. Two-fifths of this plastic was exported to developing countries, fueling a problematic system in which higher income countries send low-quality and dirty plastic to be recycled outside of their borders: given the difficulty in repurposing such materials, these often end up in landfills or being burnt, therefore contributing to pollution.,The government has agreed to comply with a tightening of the Basel Convention’s rules, which regulate transnational movements of waste, to avoid non-recyclable plastics from being exported in the first place. It is also considering expanding municipal collection to all types of plastic waste, not just PET bottles, containers and packages.,Yet the pandemic has likely caused the waste pile to grow. An Environment Ministry survey reveals that a charge on plastic bags adopted in July has reduced demand for such items, but these account for only 2% of plastic waste.,“(In contrast), from April to September 2020, containers and packages increased by around 6%, reversing the trend seen in recent years,” says Yoshihide Hirao, director of the Environment Ministry’s Office for Recycling Promotion.,Japanese materials have thus focused on alternative approaches to the way products are disposed of.,
,
,Ina Food Industry makes more than 100 types of agar, which is used in confectionery, food, beverages and cosmetics. Choosing innovation over short-term profit a decade ago, it began selling edible films made from seaweed.,“We have a policy called ‘tree ring management’, which means the company grows slowly every year like a tree,” CEO Hidehiro Tsukakoshi says. “When we started developing the film, we weren’t even sure how to use it. Now, it is found in Japan’s largest convenience stores.”,The agar-based film conserves the freshness of products such as tarts and pies. It also melts in hot water, making it ideal for packaging edible items such as powdered soup.,“This is convenient and sustainable because consumers don’t need to waste plastic film,” Tsukakoshi says.,Marubeni’s Edish is also edible, not by humans but by animals.,“While polluted plastic can’t be recycled but only burnt or sent to landfill, our disposable tableware can become compost and animal feed,” Yanase says.,Once collected in designated boxes in venues where it is used, the material is re-employed directly in agriculture or transformed in industrial composting machines, for example in Tokyo’s Kasai Rinkai Park.,“This step isn’t straightforward because Japan has strict waste management laws,” Yanase says. “Therefore, we cooperate closely with local governments, for example in Shizuoka City, which is also interested in using Edish.”,
,“Many Japanese companies aren’t sure yet whether the circular economy will be profitable in the future,” says Yoshikawa from Material ConneXion Tokyo. “That’s something the government has to show them.”,Japanese alternatives to fossil-based plastic are gaining ground, but a cohesive vision concerning their role in manufacturing and within a holistic approach to plastic is missing. Not just in Japan, but globally.,While there is no centralized international authority setting guidelines to tackle what is fundamentally a transnational issue, substituting fossil-based plastics requires deep changes not only to make alternative materials competitive but also to reduce plastic consumption, design products circularly and improve recycling.,These are actions that governments, businesses or consumers are unable to undertake alone.,Efforts to stem plastic pollution offer a unique chance to confront its underlying causes. A vision for reducing the amount of plastic we use must tackle the very sustainability of how we live, Odachi says.,Chemist Braungart goes a step further.,“It’s about rethinking, reinventing, redesigning, not reducing, reusing, recycling,” he says. “Otherwise you’re just optimizing the wrong things.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,From the impeccable Zen gardens of Kyoto to the sacred forests surrounding shrines such as Meiji Jingu in Tokyo, Japan is admired for its traditional gardens that often provide a welcome respite from the concrete jungles that surround them.,However, rapid urbanization over the past half century — 91% of people nationwide currently live in urban areas compared to around 75% in 1975 — has gone hand in hand with a reduction of urban green spaces.,
,“If farmland and woodland is taken into account, the total area of green spaces in Tokyo has decreased by around 219,000 hectares — approximately 22% — from 1965 to 2005,” says Yoshinori Akiyama, senior deputy director of the environment office at the land ministry.,Even though Tokyo’s urban parks have increased by 16,000 hectares over the same period, the city still has a remarkably low percentage of park space — 6.2% — compared to dedicated spaces found in capitals such as Stockholm (29.4%), Paris (24.3%) and London (11.2%).,The loss of such green spaces has tangible consequences on the wellbeing of citizens and the environment. Analysts say that it is important to re-imagine how cities are designed and built so that planners can respond to the challenges posed by increasing urbanization and climate change.,If properly designed, urban green spaces — even small ones — can lower surrounding air temperatures, boost biodiversity, and provide a whole range of health and social benefits.,
,
,The loss of green spaces in Japan’s cities has been occurring against a backdrop of rising global temperatures, a warming effect that is even more pronounced in urban areas.,In the 20th century, the average temperature in six large cities in Japan, including Tokyo and Nagoya, increased by 2-3 degrees Celsius, compared to a global average of 0.6 degrees.,“This temperature pattern — whereby temperatures remain higher in central areas compared to suburban metropolitan areas — is known as the ‘urban heat island,’” says Takehiko Mikami, emeritus professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, who has conducted extensive research on urban climatology and the impact of green spaces on city temperatures.,The urban heat island effect is caused by two main factors: heat emissions connected to human activities (such as engine emissions and air conditioning) and the heat retention of artificial surfaces, such as cement or asphalt, compared to natural ones typically found in forests or fields.,
,
,Cement and asphalt have a low albedo, which means that solar energy is absorbed during the day, resulting in an accumulation of heat that is then released gradually, causing higher temperatures (especially at night).,In contrast, green areas create a cooling effect through evapotranspiration during the daytime and heat loss from the ground surface (radiation cooling) at night. The cold breeze felt when walking through a city park on a hot summer’s night is an example of radiation cooling in action.,The urban heat island effect poses a significant health threat to city dwellers, leading to an increase in cases of heat stroke and heat stress, particularly during the night, Mikami says.,Studies even indicate a direct correlation between death rates and the number of days in which maximum temperatures are above 30 degrees Celsius and nights in which minimum temperatures remain above 25 degrees.,“It is important to preserve or even increase green areas in big cities because cool air seeps out into the surrounding neighborhood, even when the areas are small,” says Mikami, whose research on Japanese cities demonstrates that surface and air temperatures in city parks are a lot lower than the built-up areas around them. “We call this the ‘cool island effect.’”,
,
,Planners, developers and city dwellers are increasingly concerned with how to include natural elements in urban settings where lack of space is often an issue. Encouragingly, research shows that the benefits of urban greening can even be achieved with relatively small green spaces, particularly if connected to one another by corridors of trees.,One approach whose popularity is growing rapidly was pioneered by a renowned Japanese botanist, professor Akira Miyawaki. The “Miyawaki method” involves planting potted saplings of native tree and plant species to create dense forests on small plots of land.,Social aspects such as engaging local citizens in the creation and management of the forests are also integral to the method, which has inspired the planting of almost 40 million trees worldwide.,“Heavy industrialization in the 1960s was destroying nature and Miyawaki wanted to restore natural forests in the urban deserts that had been created since 1971,” says Kazue Fujiwara, professor emerita at Yokohama National University, who learnt the method directly from its creator.,Fujiwara has been involved in the planting of Miyawaki forests since she was a research student at Yokohama National University, where she contributed to parts of the dense on-campus forest that has grown to be a symbol of the university.,The Yokohama National University campus is a green oasis in one of the largest and most densely populated metropolitan areas in the world. Although small, the forest is a great example of the benefits of using native species, Fujiwara says. In fact, she emphasises that it’s not just a few trees and lawns that we need, but a specific type of planned urban greening.,
,
,“Professor Miyawaki taught us that natural forests have regulated themselves for hundreds of thousands of years and they’ll continue to do so until the next ice age, that’s why we must plant native species,” Fujiwara says.,The technique has been shown to be effective worldwide, irrespective of soil and climatic conditions, says Daan Bleichrodt, founder of Tiny Forests, a Netherlands-based initiative that has been developing Miyawaki forests in urban settings since 2015.,Miyawaki forests are self-sustaining, biodiverse and resilient. They require very little maintenance and, after a mere three years, they can be left to grow naturally without the need for human intervention.,Furthermore, research conducted on Tiny Forests’ projects reveals their exceptional cooling capacity, whereby the forest surfaces were cooler than nearby paved surfaces by up to 21 degrees Celsius on a hot summer’s day.,“It is difficult to find land, especially in urban settings, where you can plant trees, but what is good about the Miyawaki method is that it is very well adapted to small areas where you want quick results,” says biologist and naturalist Nicolas de Brabandere, who founded Urban Forests in 2016 and has already planted more than 30 urban forests in Europe, some of which are as small as a tennis court.,According to de Brabandere, the biodiversity benefits of the Miyawaki method are even more pronounced when compared to regular city gardening schemes involving the planting of lawns, shrubs or flowers, which can be 20 to 100 times less biodiverse.,
,
,Urban green spaces also have the potential to help people rediscover their connection to the natural world. This is the philosophy underpinning India-based Afforestt, founded by Shubhendhu Sharma, which has been planting Miyawaki forests and sharing knowledge on the method for more than 10 years.,Forestscaping is Afforestt’s latest project, a seamless integration of art, design and nature.,“The mainstream approach to urban greening around the world is about creating grass lawns,” says Sharma. “This is a shame because the way nature grows is totally different, forests are tremendously more beautiful than manicured lawns and gardens.”,By creating native forests that encourage human interaction – for example, by including benches, observation decks and even sculptures — Sharma wants people to enjoy Miyawaki forests in the same way as they would traditional parks.,Through Forestscaping, Sharma has added a new element to Miyawaki forests, while also following the same principles that have made them so effective in the first place.,
,
,“Human intervention should not always be looked upon as a negative influence on the forest,” he says. “We’re creative beings and can add value to natural ecosystems because we’re a part of nature.”,Historically, green areas such as parks have always been a point of welcome respite for urban dwellers. They have been linked to a positive impact on the real estate value of surrounding neighborhoods, lower crime rates, enhanced creativity and the promotion of social interaction.,The desire to use natural elements to bring people together was one of the guiding principles behind the hugely successful Namba Green Parks project developed by California-based architectural partnership Jerde.,The redevelopment project has transformed an old industrial area in Osaka’s chaotic and highly urbanized Namba district into a green commercial hub, which includes office spaces and a shopping mall. Nature is incorporated into the very structure of the building’s multi-layered outdoor terraces and roof gardens, joining natural elements with man-made ones.,“Upon visiting the site, we immediately realized it needed nature,” says Phil Kim, Jerde’s Asia-Pacific managing director. “Our objective was to create a place where people could meet and get a sense of greenery.”,Jeri Oka, the project’s senior designer, describes visiting Namba Parks as being in a park rather than on a roof garden. There are more than 300 species of vegetation that people can read about as they walk around.,“We wanted to create an educational aspect but in an experiential way,” she says.,
,
, (literally, “forest bathing”) is a Japanese concept that refers to the practice of immersing oneself in forests as a form of therapy or healing.,Understanding how to bring the benefits reaped from being in nature to urban environments, that are characterized by vast expanses of concrete and tight living spaces, is becoming a priority for urban planners.,“We need urban forests for biodiversity conservation, for education and enhancing our creativity, and a range of other health benefits,” says Cecil Konijnendijk, a professor of urban forestry at the University of British Columbia and director of the Nature Based Solutions Institute.,Research demonstrates that people are mentally, physically and socially healthier when they live in greener environments, Konijnendijk says. “The current COVID-19 pandemic has once again shown how important our local green spaces are as a way to relax and escape stress.”,As an expert in urban forestry who has advised national and local governments in 30 or so countries, Konijnendijk believes successful urban greening projects are often dependent on government policies that determine the planning and management of public spaces.,
,
,In April 2001, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government established greenery standards for the rooftops and areas surrounding the construction or renovation of building sites that are larger than 1,000 square meters (250 square meters for public facilities). This means that developers now have to complete and submit a greenery plan as part of the planning permission process.,“We’re developing a green plan on the premise that greenery has multiple functions, such as improving the urban environment, mitigating the heat island effect, providing habitats for living things, as well as facilitating disaster prevention,” says Kazuhiko Aoyama, director for greenery policy planning and coordination at the Natural Environment Division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.,On a national scale, the Environment Ministry has also recognized the need for urban greening and approved a 2018 climate change adaptation plan that includes measures such as promoting urban green spaces to tackle the heat island effect, says Toshio Torii, director-general of the Nature Conservation Bureau.,Furthermore, Torii believes that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s recent commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 will bring a shift in environmental policy and help raise awareness about the need for urban green spaces as part of broader measures to lower emissions by absorbing carbon dioxide.,“Urban green spaces have a variety of important functions such as providing a comfortable living environment, children’s emotional education, evacuation sites in the event of a disaster, biodiversity conservation and the mitigation of the heat island effect,” Torii says.,Aside from their tangible benefits, urban forests can be transformative, stimulating people to reflect on the value of nature even in the heart of a city.,“Once we create a new perspective of how our habitat should be and how our cities can become,” Afforestt’s Sharma says, “a lot of change will start to happen.”,

			,Contributing writer,The pleasure of soaking in a secluded hot spring enveloped by the sights and sounds of nature is an experience that many in Japan love to indulge in. The country is renowned for the abundance and beauty of its ,, or hot springs.,Many onsen users report gaining a sense of inner peace and connection with nature from such an experience. Yet engineering hot water to flow constantly from the depths of the Earth can potentially endanger fragile natural resources — first and foremost, the coveted hot-spring water sources themselves.,
,Hot springs are deeply rooted in Japan’s culture and history, with the country’s oldest establishment, Dogo Onsen in Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, thought to be up to 3,000 years old. As such, they are important pillars for local economies and the tourism industry.,However, the public and private use of hot springs in modern times has had a significant impact on the surrounding environment, as they aren’t an infinite resource, says Yutaka Seki, executive managing director of the Japan Onsen Association.,“It’s inevitable that the environment will be adversely affected if proper use isn’t taken into consideration,” Seki says.,
,
,The postwar tourism boom, combined with technological advances, has led in some cases to excessive excavation being carried out to release hot-spring water from underground, where it’s naturally stored, causing its depletion as well as changes in water quality, Seki says.,The popularity of hot springs is a natural consequence of Japan’s geology. The country’s abundance of volcanoes, whose hot magma fluid heats groundwater, as well as “deep water” and “fossil seawater” hot-spring formations, where water is heated by other types of geothermal energy, contribute to the country’s 27,969 onsen sources.,This impressive number is determined by the Hot Spring Act of 1948, which defines an onsen as water, water vapor or gas (with the exception of natural gases whose main component is hydrocarbon) that contain a prescribed quantity of chemical components or whose temperature is 25 degrees Celsius or more. The legislation also sets guidelines to protect hot-spring sources.,“Architecture is one of the first things we should be thinking about in terms of onsen sustainability,” says Iris Law, author of the book “The Onsen Experience: A Guide to Japan’s Hot Spring Sanctuaries.” However, the sheer variety of hot spring facilities — ranging from naturally occurring pools to large-scale resorts in urban areas — complicates the picture.,To understand whether Japan’s modern-day proliferation of bathing establishments, including thousands of lodgings, is compatible with limited environmental resources, we must begin with water: its journey from the sky to below our feet and then above ground again.,
,
,The large amounts of rain and snow that fall on the Japanese archipelago every year cyclically replenish its groundwater and, therefore, hot-spring sources.,“For an onsen to be considered sustainable there should be a balance between the input, which is rainwater, and the output, which is the hot spring,” says groundwater hydrologist Makoto Yamada, an associate professor at Ryukoku University in Kyoto.,Pure onsen water, known as , in Japanese, is devoid of additives and is used unfiltered, and can flow naturally from the ground or be extracted mechanically.,“Normally, in Japan, it’s dug out from the ground, so it isn’t natural. Wherever you are in the country, you can probably excavate and find hot springs if the conditions are right,” Yamada says.,Therefore, even areas that aren’t traditionally famed as onsen hot spots can boost local economies and tourism by unearthing the precious sources.,“The problem with excavating in the same area is that this could lead to the depletion of groundwater resources,” Yamada says.,Environmental standards are in place to avert this, together with the risk of landslides, soil erosion, toxic gas generation, overflowing water, contamination of public water areas, and those posed by noise and vibrations.,“Plans to excavate must be approved by prefectural governments,” which also monitor the consumption of onsen water to prevent its excessive use, says Takahiro Okano, director of the Environment Ministry’s Office for Conservation and Promotion of Hot Springs.,Before digging, especially if to a depth of over a kilometer, the Japan Onsen Association recommends that a local council be held to evaluate the project.,
,
,Overall, hot-spring resource management is a local affair, as the Hot Spring Act doesn’t set specific provisions as to how deep excavations can be carried out or how far onsen water can be transported from its original source — though the longer the journey, the more expensive and therefore unattractive to developers it’s likely to be. The law also stipulates that it’s up to prefectures, municipalities and individual establishments to regulate the amount of water and energy that each onsen consumes.,Oita Prefecture is one of Japan’s main hot-spring areas, with its second-largest city of Beppu claiming to have the highest output of hot-spring water — 87,000 liters per minute — and concentration of hot-spring sources — around 2,300 — in the country.,In order to preserve onsen water, a vital resource for the area, the prefecture has set a limit as to how far it can be transported from its original source and prohibits new excavation in certain areas of Beppu.,“Furthermore, when hot water is pumped using a compressor, it’s capped at 50 liters per minute or less to avoid too much of it from being extracted,” says Kenichiro Nakamura from Beppu City’s Hot Spring Division.,
,Mechanically extracting and allocating groundwater, as well as operating onsen facilities, not only impacts the landscape and hydrological resources, but requires a stable supply of energy.,“Energy and water are strongly connected. If you use a lot of water, you use a lot of energy,” says hydrologist Makoto Taniguchi, deputy director general of the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature in Kyoto.,Efficient resource use is, therefore, of paramount concern.,
,
,A promising development in this sense is the “cascade” model, Taniguchi says, whereby onsen water is used for different purposes at different temperatures.,One application is in agriculture. For example, hot-spring water is used to heat greenhouses and cultivate crops such as shiitake mushrooms and chrysanthemums in Beppu, and bananas in Okuhida Onsen in Takayama, Gifu Prefecture.,Another use is for heating, and even cooling, buildings such as houses as well as onsens themselves. In Matsunoyama Onsen in Tokamachi, Niigata Prefecture, steam and hot water are used to heat buildings and floors and to melt snow — as well as to cook a local specialty, , pork.,The most significant example of multistage use of hot-spring resources is for geothermal energy, which currently accounts for 0.2% of Japan’s electricity demand, even though it’s thought it could cover up to 10%.,Power generation facilities known as ,, usually small-scale binary power plants that use heat from hot springs, are in operation throughout the country.,Such projects, however, have been met with resistance from onsen owners who fear that sharing hot springs will leave them without the resource sustaining their businesses’ very existence.,“Excessive excavation for power generation may lead to the depletion of hot-spring resources, deterioration of spring quality, frequent earthquakes and worsening impact on forest environments,” Seki says.,
,
,Onsen owners have, in some cases, blocked geothermal energy development, says Masaho Adachi, adviser to the Japan Geothermal Association, citing the Oguni geothermal plant in Kumamoto Prefecture, a project marred by opposition from hot-spring operators in Kurokawa Onsen.,In other areas, such as Ebino Kogen in Miyazaki Prefecture and near the Yanaizu-Nishiyama geothermal power plant in Yanaizu, Fukushima Prefecture, geothermal energy projects have been blamed for the depletion of hot-spring resources.,The Japan Geothermal Association denies these allegations.,“There are 19 large-scale geothermal power plants and there’s no evidence of them affecting onsens,” Adachi says.,In some cases, onsen establishments and geothermal plants have been able to co-exist. According to Adachi, energy developers are even helping hot-spring operators solve certain problems by applying geothermal knowledge and techniques.,The Takenaka Okuhida geothermal power plant, which began operating in Takayama in March 2021 with an expected annual power generation capacity of 500 megawatt hours — equivalent to the energy needs of around 100 households — was launched on the back of a collaboration with the Okuhida Onsen Cooperative. And Oita, which has seen a rapid expansion of geothermal development in recent years, is home to Japan’s biggest plant, Hatchobaru, which has a generating capacity of 110 megawatts.,Whether you believe geothermal energy or onsens provide the most benefit to society and the environment depends on your position, Yamada says.,From society’s point of view, geothermal power is a viable renewable energy source (which, however, comes with environmental complications), but if it does indeed limit onsen resources, this may negatively impact local communities.,“The best option is to use geothermal energy and maintain enough resources for onsens, but this can be difficult because in some cases we don’t know how to do that,” Yamada adds.,
,After having been extracted and having fulfilled its purpose of soothing onsen-goers’ minds and bodies, hot-spring water is eventually returned to nature. In Japan, it’s either treated through sewers or, when it’s too hot, released directly into the environment.,However, “the amount and impact of such effluents on rivers are currently unknown,” Okano says.,
,
,This practice is common in Beppu, where hot-spring water over 45 degrees Celsius is drained into the environment by means of underdrains. Together with other researchers, Yamada and Taniguchi conducted a study, published in 2017, evaluating the impact of hot-spring drainage on the water quality and temperature of six rivers in the area, as well as on the fish populations of two of these rivers.,The study found that in the Hirata River, the most affected by hot-spring drainage in the Beppu area, the Nile tilapia, a foreign invasive fish species, made up more than 80% of total fish biomass. Its proliferation was connected to the influx of onsen water, which increased the river’s temperature and enriched it with minerals and nutrients, therefore increasing the availability of phytoplankton, which Nile tilapia feed on, and creating a better habitat for the species.,The study concludes that the effects of onsen drainage on river and coastal ecosystems remain unclear, as the wider implications of its findings are yet unknown.,“There’s still very little research on the effects of onsen water drainage on living organisms in rivers,” Yamada says.,Another issue concerning hot-spring drainage is that of pollutants. Okano explains that onsen effluents are regulated by the Water Pollution Prevention Act, which establishes legal limits for toxic substances such as arsenic, long-term exposure to which can cause cancer and skin lesions.,According to Taniguchi, hot-spring water in Beppu has been found to contain arsenic levels over the legal limit, as the technology to treat the water and reduce contamination is currently unavailable. In response, the Environment Ministry has granted a moratorium period, which has been extended multiple times.,“Eventually, the water reaches the ocean and is diluted by a huge volume of seawater. Plus, no health issues have been detected in people in the area,” Taniguchi says. “But it still isn’t known what the effects of this arsenic contamination are.”,
,What is clear is that the relationship between onsens and ecosystems is still poorly understood.,While on the surface, regulations are in place to protect hot-spring sources and public safety, “these rules are concerned with setting thresholds for risk, not with what is needed to actively promote biodiversity and environmental well-being,” Taniguchi says.,
,
,Ultimately, a better grasp of the complex interaction between hot springs and the environment is needed to evaluate whether or not onsens are sustainable. In fact, hot-spring operators themselves have a vested interest in safeguarding natural landscapes, Law says.,“If the surrounding environment isn’t preserved, water quality is negatively impacted. This is something that many onsen owners understand deeply,” Law says.,Law offers the example of Hoshi Onsen Chojukan in Minakami, Gunma Prefecture, located inside Joshin’etsukogen National Park, whose owners have contributed to studying local flora and fauna for generations. The town itself is part of the Minakami UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, and is home to 150 onsen inns and hotels, says Hirokazu Ono from Minakami’s town office.,Many hot-spring establishments have already embraced some of the core principles of sustainability, including efficient use of water, energy and land resources, embracing low-impact architecture, contributing to nature conservation and serving locally grown food.,“If they learn to promote themselves for these activities, not only does this help their core business but, more importantly, it contributes to educating visitors and the community about the importance of environmental preservation,” Law says.,Ultimately, hot-spring users themselves can play a key role in promoting more responsible forms of hot-spring tourism by asking the right questions in their quest for a more transparent onsen experience.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Staff writer,The rusty tracks of an abandoned timber line meander along the edge of a steep cliff overlooking a gurgling, rocky river.,Half-buried in the forest path, these steel rails guide hikers through the mountains of Okuchichibu to where two tributaries join, marking the official starting point of the Arakawa, or “raging river.”,
,One of the capital’s most important water sources, the Arakawa is also the deadliest river in Japan in the event of flooding — risks being amplified by extreme weather, rising sea levels and other climate-related events associated with global warming.,It is from here, at the western edge of Saitama Prefecture, that the Arakawa begins its 173-kilometer journey. Flowing east down the mountain slopes to the Chichibu basin, the river then turns north through the famed rock terraces of Nagatoro Valley before making its way southeast into the Kanto Plains. After winding through the capital’s densely populated northeastern wards, it finally deposits into Tokyo Bay.,Covering 2,940 square kilometers, the Arakawa River basin is home to approximately 10 million people and spreads across the Tokyo metropolitan area, where one-third of Japan’s population and industries are concentrated. A major source of agricultural irrigation and tap water, the river is, quite literally, the lifeblood of the nation’s economy.,As its name suggests, however, the river has been known for its fiery temperament. Records indicate major floods dating back as far as 858, and more recently, in 1910, when what is known as the Great Kanto Flood saw Arakawa and many other rivers burst when two typhoons coincided with the rainy season, killing hundreds, destroying thousands of homes and inundating the Kanto Plains and much of Tokyo.,
,
,While infrastructure projects and high-tech warning systems have since beefed up disaster resilience in cities and municipalities lying near the Arakawa, studies indicate climate change may be putting that to the test, with the frequency of short-duration downpours, also known as guerrilla rainstorms, increasing over the past few decades.,“In terms of the potential scale of damage it could inflict, the Arakawa tops all the rivers in Japan,” says Norio Tanaka, a professor at Saitama University’s Graduate School of Science and Engineering. “If it floods in Tokyo, the impact will shake the nation’s entire economy.”,
,Historically, there have been five main areas along the Arakawa that have been prone to flood hazards, says Tanaka, an expert on river engineering.,The alluvial fan — a triangular spread of sediment — near the city of Kumagaya in Saitama Prefecture has seen frequent flooding, as well as the town of Yoshimi, south of Kumagaya, which lies near the river. The Iruma River, part of the Arakawa river system, has seen its banks overwhelmed during bouts of heavy rain, while the town of Kawajima, sandwiched between the Arakawa and Tone rivers, has seen its levees breached around 30 times over the past 300 years, according to Tanaka.,“The fifth and final point is after the Arakawa is joined by the Iruma River. If the Arakawa No. 1 Retention Basin (located in Toda, Saitama Prefecture) is unable to control floodwaters and the right bank of the Arakawa bursts, Tokyo and its city center will be in danger as floodwaters could inundate subway systems and underground shopping centers,” he says.,The land ministry has simulated one similar scenario in detail: Record-breaking heavy rains triggered by a typhoon see rainfall exceeding 680 millimeters over three days in the upper reaches of the Arakawa in the mountains of Chichibu. At 3 a.m., water levels rise dangerously at the Iwabuchi sluice gate at the junction of the Sumida and Arakawa rivers, leading local governments to issue evacuation orders.,At 4 a.m., the river breaks loose at the capital’s northern Kita Ward, at a location approximately 21 kilometers from the mouth of the river. Muddy streams spill into the city, expanding rapidly. By 10 a.m., the water reaches Machiya Station on the Chiyoda subway line and, by 11 a.m., Kita, Itabashi, Arakawa, Adachi and Taito are among the central Tokyo wards being flooded.,By 5 p.m., many of the subway lines running through the city center have been submerged, and office districts in Chiyoda and Chuo wards have lost all power.,In total, 160 square kilometers of land is inundated, impacting 1.8 million people. An estimated 3,100 people die in the disaster, and up to 700,000 remain isolated a day after the flooding, according to this particular sequence of hypothetical events. Most of Tokyo’s lifelines are paralyzed, and it will take between two weeks and a month for the water to drain, devastating the domestic economy.,“People tend to forget that there’s an interval between the time of maximum rainfall intensity to the time of the peak rate of stream flow,” says Katsuhiro Tsuji, deputy director of the Arakawa-Karyu River Office.,
,
,When Typhoon Hagibis made landfall on Japan’s mainland and wreaked havoc in October 2019, the water level of the Arakawa peaked well after rainfall ceased and evacuees returned home.,The typhoon, which killed more than 100 and collapsed levees on more than 70 rivers, saw the Iwabuchi sluice gate in Kita Ward close for the first time in 12 years to prevent water from the Arakawa entering the Sumida River, whose embankments are lower than the Arakawa and thus more vulnerable to flooding.,And on the morning of Oct. 13, after the typhoon had passed, the Arakawa’s water level reached 7.17 meters — the third highest level recorded since World War II and alarmingly close to the 7.7 meters considered a dangerous threshold.,Over the years, various infrastructure projects have been budgeted to reduce flood damage. In the Arakawa’s upstream Chichibu region, for example, there are three dams that retain water during heavy rainfall — the Urayama, Futase and Takizawa dams.,Meanwhile, so-called super levees — gigantic mounds that are 200 to 300 meters wide and can integrate commercial, residential and public spaces — have been built in low-lying or densely populated urban areas where flooding could potentially lead to serious consequences.,“Many residential neighborhoods near the Arakawa are situated in areas below sea level and could flood, for example, if an earthquake destroys levees. In order to prevent that from happening, construction work is ongoing to reinforce the foundation of dikes,” Tsuji says.,In 2019, the capital’s Edogawa Ward updated its hazard map for the first time in 11 years, urging residents to flee from the ward to other areas in the event of wide-scale flooding. Sandwiched between the Arakawa and Edogawa rivers and facing Tokyo Bay, 70% of its land is below sea level, making it one of the most vulnerable among the city’s wards to disasters caused by torrential rain, typhoons and high tides.,It’s not only Edogawa Ward. Most areas in the low-lying “five wards of Koto” in eastern Tokyo — also including Adachi, Katsushika, Koto and Sumida — will be submerged in a worst-case scenario, affecting 2.5 million people, or more than 90% of the entire population of the five wards combined.,While a combination of dams, retention reservoirs and the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel — the world’s largest underground drainage channel in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture — helped avert a similar scenario during Hagibis’ landfall, things could have taken a turn to the worst if it had rained more or if the storm traveled a little more slowly.,
,For centuries, managing and controlling the Arakawa has been a priority for the nation’s leaders.,Before the Edo Period (1603-1868), the path of the Arakawa and other rivers flowing into Tokyo Bay were volatile and susceptible to changing courses during floods — akin to eels thrashing around in the mud.,
,
,When feudal warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu founded the Tokugawa shogunate, he embarked on an ambitious infrastructure drive to develop the Kanto Plain through flood control and irrigation.,Ieyasu ordered the eastward relocation of the Tone River to mitigate flood risks, create farmland and improve ship transportation logistics — a project that began in 1594 and took 60 years to complete. Then, in 1629, construction commenced to separate the Arakawa from the Tone River near Koshigaya in present-day Saitama Prefecture so it flowed into Tokyo Bay via the Sumida River.,But that didn’t tame the Arakawa. As the nation’s population soared and urbanization progressed during the Meiji Era (1868–1912), flood damage re-emerged as a serious concern, according to Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, a civil engineering expert and technical counselor at the Japan Riverfront Research Center.,Triggered by the Great Kanto Flood of 1910, the Meiji government launched a massive project involving the construction of a floodgate in the Iwabuchi district of Kita Ward and digging a 500-meter-wide drainage canal extending 22 kilometers from Iwabuchi to Tokyo Bay. This would allow the Iwabuchi sluice gate to close during floods to control the rise of the main branch of the Arakawa and enable most of the water to run straight into the sea.,The work was finished in 1930, and the drainage canal was renamed the Arakawa in 1965. Meanwhile, the old Arakawa branching from the Iwabuchi sluice gate came to be called the Sumida River.,That didn’t prevent major storms from flooding the Arakawa, however. In September 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck the Kanto region and caused the Arakawa and Tone rivers to overflow, triggering disastrous flooding that killed 1,077 people and left 853 missing.,“In recent years, the government and municipalities have been investing in super levees and other projects to enhance flood resilience. But these initiatives will take decades for completion,” says Tsuchiya, author of “Shuto Suibotsu” (“The Capital Submerged”). “There’ve also been plans to move part of the capital’s functions elsewhere to mitigate risks, but Tokyo remains the economic and political center of Japan.”,That means residents in flood-prone areas need to be prepared for the worst. The 2020 version of the , says the frequency of heavy rains, major flooding and landslides have been increasing due to global warming, and that Japan needs to brace for meteorological disasters of an unprecedented scale.,Tsuchiya also warns of earthquakes, especially the anticipated , (earthquake directly beneath the capital) that seismologists warn could happen any time.,
,
,Just over 18% of earthquakes in the world take place in Japan, which sits on or near the boundaries of four tectonic plates. In 2013, the government issued a report predicting that there is a 70% chance of a magnitude-7 earthquake striking the capital region in the next 30 years.,“What would happen then? Besides the various scenarios anticipated, we will also likely see levees destroyed and rivers spilling out of control,” Tsuchiya says.,The expansive subway network stretching from Saitama to Kanagawa prefectures and the proliferation of asphalt-covered roads can also accelerate the spread of floodwater and give it a wider reach. Meanwhile, small, wooden homes and makeshift facilities crowd numerous neighborhoods in Tokyo, meaning many houses could be severely damaged in the event of major flooding.,“Even with ample warning, there are going to be people isolated if the Arakawa floods,” says Yasuo Matsushima, who heads the Disaster Risk Assessment Research Institute consultancy.,“They could be the elderly, families with small children or those stranded since heavy traffic congestion is expected as people try to escape water-trapped wards via bridges,” he says.,Electricity will be lost, and just 3 meters of water is enough to reach the second floor of structures, he says. And there won’t be sufficient public facilities for those in submerged areas to seek refuge.,“That’s why it’s important for both individuals and communities to decide on where to flee in case the Arakawa floods,” he says.,In the final scenes of “Weathering With You,” Makoto Shinkai’s award-winning 2019 feature animation, much of Tokyo is drowned in water after years of nonstop rain. As improbable as that may seem, there’s only so much precipitation the “raging river” can take before it climbs over its banks once again, engulfing anything that stands in its way.,Resting by a road running near the Iwabuchi sluice gate is a stone , statue donning a red hood and clutching a staff. A wooden sign next to the Buddhist deity explains its significance:,“This jizō was built by local volunteers to commemorate the many water accidents of the past.”,

			,Contributing writer,A few months ago, I embarked on a three-week pilgrimage throughout the country to visit several often-overlooked historical cities and towns of note. I took this journey, masked, just as the state of emergency was lifted in late March. I did it alone. And it was transformative.,To date, the country has administered over 60 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and is currently inoculating over 1 million residents every day. On that note, we can reasonably assume that it might not be that long before we can all feel comfortable traveling among others again. And perhaps it might not be too soon to begin planning a pilgrimage of your own.,
,
,The two-car train on the Ofunato Line departed Ichinoseki Station at 10:17 a.m. Eleven minutes into the 88-minute journey eastward toward Kesennuma, Miyagi Prefecture, the train, called the “Dragon Tail” by locals, owing to the route being shaped like the mythical serpent, slowed to a halt and jostled from side to side. A magnitude 6.6 earthquake had just jolted the area. After 15 minutes of stillness, the conductor walked the length of the train’s two cars patiently inquiring about the destination of each of the 35 passengers. He seemed visibly nervous when he learned toward me, most likely pondering whether his native Japanese would be understood.,“Ehhh…,” he said, obviously contemplating how to best phrase his question.,Not wanting to prolong his apparent discomfort, I softly responded, “Kesennuma.” He penciled each passenger’s response in a palm-sized notebook.,A visibly disturbed teenage boy paced the aisle, repeatedly asking an elderly couple about the earthquake’s magnitude. After about six interruptions, they shooed him away. He continued to march from one car end to the other, repeatedly advising himself aloud, “I should call my mother. I can’t get there by bus.”,
,
,After two hours and seven minutes of sitting idle on a single track in forested Tohoku countryside, the conductor opened the rear car’s back door, lowered a ladder, and asked the passengers to descend. As I approached, he once again seemed concerned about me properly comprehending him. He stepped in front to demonstrate how to suitably descend the ladder. After climbing down, the 35 of us walked single file between the two rails for about 10 minutes until we reached a clearing to a nearby road. Groups were formed by destination and then herded into awaiting taxi vans. Upon arrival at Kesennuma Station, the stationmaster welcomed us apologetically and covered payment: ¥18,270, according to the meter.,I then boarded a bus to my chief destination for the day: the Ruins of the Great East Japan Earthquake Kesennuma City Memorial Museum. The 40-minute route crossed huge tsunami-cleared areas in the middle of great infrastructure development, a civil engineer’s canvas — new roads, bridges, river embankments and seawalls.,The museum itself is the former site of a high school only steps from the shore, today shielded by a new 7.2-meter-high seawall. The tsunami waters on March 11, 2011, rose 12 meters above the outside ground, reaching 25 centimeters above the third-floor ceiling of the four-story school. An automobile deposited in a third-floor classroom is rather unnerving, but more chilling may be a set of wobbly student desks on the roof that had been stacked atop one another in a frantic attempt to get to yet a higher point as the rough waves splashed about. My eyes fixed on a photo showing people on the rooftop as the volatile ocean neared the edge, and I couldn’t help but acknowledge a timbre of tension not even close to what must have been endured on that fateful afternoon.,
,
,“We would like you to ‘wash your hands’ and ‘gargle’ carefully to prevent infectious diseases, such as influenza. — Japan Hotel Association”,Having addressed the science behind the Japanese custom of gargling as a measure against infectious disease in this very newspaper over a decade ago, I was rather amused to come across a notice recommending as much in the bathroom of my Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, accommodation.,The town of Matsumoto is not recognized for its gargling though; it’s distinguished for having one of the nation’s premier castles.,Completed around 1594 and nicknamed the “Crow Castle” due to its black exterior, the five-tier Matsumoto Castle is one of only 12 original castles remaining in all of Japan.,Visitors entering the wooden keep, the oldest in the nation, are asked to take off their footwear and carry it in a bag while inside, where the temperature drops significantly. The stairs from floor to floor have inclines of 55 to 61 degrees, and each step can be a physical stretch, so ascending and descending in socks on slippery wood with only one free hand — because your other hand is carrying your shoes — can be quite the acrobatic challenge.,This castle was built for battle, but oddly never saw any. A defense that captured my attention were the ,, chutes through which castle defenders supposedly could drop stones, boiling water or hot pitch to prevent enemies from scaling the stone base below. “,” means “stone,” and “,” would be “to drop,” but obvious questions about the feasibility of this defense led me to an insightful NHK documentary in which a “castle specialist” from Hiroshima University reasons that the ishi-otoshi were likely used not as a portal through which to shower attackers with rocks but rather as gunports for firing on the enemy below. So much for a name hinting at an object’s purpose.,
,As I organized items around my morning coffee in Nagasaki, a vocal young girl, probably around 3 to 4 years of age, arrived at the table next to me with her mother and grandmother. As her grandmother proceeded to head to the buffet to gather breakfast, the young girl, sitting unsettled on the lap of her mother, loudly and repeatedly asserted that , (Japanese dumplings) were desired. After the grandmother failed to return in a timely manner, the young girl looked to a staff member who was nearby and forcefully ordered, “Excuse me, dango please!”,
,
,After my breakfast entertainment, I made my way over to the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, where, after several hours of intense sympathy, I found myself going through a selection of videos of older witnesses — and not just Japanese individuals — telling their experiences on Aug. 9, 1945, and the days that followed. The non-Japanese accounts were mostly from Australian prisoners of war who had been in Nagasaki doing hard labor. In fact, the presence of foreign POWs was one of the reasons why Nagasaki was not the primary target that day. Interestingly, all the Australians interviewed supported the use of the bomb, and one in particular rationalized it by emphasizing that the previous 25 years had seen two world wars and colossal casualties, whereas the decades afterward had not seen any of the unimaginable casualties that would have accompanied more global conflict.,The primary target of the bombing that day was the city of Kokura near Kitakyushu, but after circling three times over 45 minutes and not being able to make visible confirmation, the plane carrying the bomb headed 150 kilometers south to Nagasaki, circled once because of clouds and then dropped the “Fat Man” as the clouds broke. Kokura avoided carnage and infamy that day; Nagasaki did not.,Afterward, I trammed to the other side of town and stopped by Oura Cathedral, Japan’s oldest surviving wooden church. As I exited, a 19-year-old student sitting on a bench looked up and greeted me with a simple “Hi” in English. I sat next to him, and we both looked outward into the warm afternoon sunshine. He told me that he was from Osaka, visiting grandparents in Nagasaki, and majoring in English at Ryukoku University in Kyoto. I told him that I was from Tokyo. He slowly voiced, “I like Nagasaki better than Tokyo.”,As I returned home, I found myself reflecting on the enormous amount of sudden unforeseen loss of life that had occurred throughout the nation over the centuries — from recent tsunamis up north to atomic bombs down south. It’s fascinating history eliciting rich reflection for the severe suffering endured.,Today, neighborhoods are safe, locals are approachable and welcoming, landscape is aesthetically stimulating, and local cuisine is pretty darn appetizing.

			,Contributing Writer,The pandemic experiences of small tourism businesses in Japan are eerily similar. A lucrative 2019 prompted them to invest in a 2020 that was supposed to bring the world to the Tokyo Olympics. Instead, they were not only among the first businesses to buckle under the pandemic, but might be some of the last to bounce back.,Now that the Olympics and a national vaccine rollout are underway, The Japan Times checks in with four small, non-Japanese-owned tourism businesses — tour providers ,, , and ,, and tourist accommodation service ,. How are they holding up? And how did they pivot to stay in business 18 months later?,
,
,Although the Japanese government was expecting 40 million inbound tourists in 2020, only about 4 million managed to visit before the pandemic took hold, a 99.6% drop in the number of international arrivals in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2019 according to statistics from the Japan National Tourism Organization. For small businesses that cater primarily to non-Japanese tourists ,, their customers have been out of reach.,Almost immediately, tour companies Maction Planet, Arigato Travel, Foodie Adventure Japan and Tokyo Family Stays each faced their own tidal wave of cancellations.,“We’re in this together. All cancellations will receive a full refund,” , from Foodie Adventure Japan had to tell her customers back in March 2020.,“The business we carefully built and planned for the last eight years disappeared in under a month,” echoes Tokyo Family Stays co-founder Tracey Northcott.,
,
,Initially, the Japanese government supported many businesses with its controversial Go To Travel campaign, meant to kickstart domestic tourism, but only Tokyo Family Stays was eligible. But by the time it had applied, the campaign was already , due to a national rise in COVID-19 cases.,“It was a heap of work to do that was just wasted. I wish we had spent time applying for other subsidies instead,” Northcott says.,Self-reliant and resilient, Northcott and her husband, Ashley Thredgold, began targeting domestic customers in order to keep their businesses afloat. First, they started advertising their serviced apartments to people seeking quarantine stays, as well as to stranded tourists who couldn’t get a flight back home. Another pandemic headache was the initial language barrier and expense to getting a COVID-19 test, so they started a ,.,What all of their pivots have in common is a focus on helping the non-Japanese community with what they need most, and doing so in English.,“As an entrepreneur for the last 20 years, I have been involved with a number of different businesses. We have owned a real estate company, a bar in Golden Gai, two different software companies and online news services,” Northcott says. “I can adapt and help people while creating businesses that support my own life and family.”,Keeping the same pool of customers, but changing the product is another strategy that Sakamaki employed, launching a sustainable clothing line, Foodie Wear Japan. “The clothes and accessories are made with organically harvested cotton, water-based non-toxic ink and orders are fulfilled as close as possible to minimize shipping distances,” Sakamaki explains.,
,Meanwhile, for other businesses, virtual tours and content creation became the digital answer to the closed borders problem. Arigato Travel and Maction Planet managed to do a few bespoke tours with local customers, when it was still relatively safe. But with the majority of their client base abroad, they quickly shifted online.,
,
,Maction Planet’s Mac Salman set up online cooking lessons for housebound viewers hoping to pick up new skills while self-isolating. “I call my style ‘edutainment’ — it’s both education and entertainment,” Salman says.,Arigato Travel soon realized virtual experiences would be more fun and interactive with tasting boxes, helping them stand out for their domestic customers among the sudden onslaught of online events and Zoom parties. It collaborated with companies such as Bokksu, a ,, as well as tea farms and wineries, and the immersive online experiences helped land the company on the list of the world’s best virtual tours by ,.,“In just 13 months, we have hosted around 2,000 online guests,” says Arigato Travel’s Elizabeth Anne. She attributes the success to her team and the fact they had always worked remotely, hence no telework shock to the company’s work style.,
,Not all is rosy, however. Investing is tricky when you’ve experienced abrupt financial loss. From camera equipment to editing software, the initial setup for streaming and video-making costs a fair amount. Even getting people on board with the concept of virtual tours was initially challenging.,“It was not an easy switch. The idea of virtual experiences was very new — many people doubted and underestimated them,” Anne says.,Social media was another option. Salman went the YouTube route, dedicating more time to his two channels, Maction Planet and Kanpai Planet, the latter focusing solely on Japanese drinks. Sakamaki, on the other hand, became a Twitch streamer, which she says felt more immediate and natural: She could talk to people abroad who were alone in their own mandated lockdowns in real-time.,Salman and Sakamaki pay for everything out of pocket — whether they are taste-testing drinks and ,food, or taking a trip to Super Nintendo World in Osaka — in hopes of breaking through on platforms already saturated with established creators. Sakamaki is upfront about the fact that this pivot hasn’t been financially successful yet, but says her bond with the newly formed, tight-knit community is priceless.,
,Hopes are pinned on future “revenge travel,” the phenomenon of increased travel and spending to make up for lost time during the pandemic. Whenever Japan opens up again for overseas tourists, all four businesses are planning to resume their in-person services (albeit while maintaining their virtual tours and content creation, too).,Sakamaki also believes travel will stay local for longer. She hopes that this will help with overtourism in the long run, as popular places develop new strategies to manage guests and inbound travel businesses craft itineraries for off-the-beaten-track destinations, bringing business to areas that need it most.,Whatever the future “new normal” will bring, travel is on everyone’s bucket list, if customer reviews of Arigato Travel’s virtual offerings on Tripadvisor are any indication. “I cannot wait to go to Japan. I can add knowing how to eat like a local to my preparation list,” a recent review gushes. “Hope to take a tour with you guys in person soon!”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,,"Japan 2030:,The Japan Times","Self-Defense Forces personnel search for flood victims in Motomiya, Fukushima Prefecture, in October in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis. KYODO,As the country’s bushland has burned over the past few months, more than an estimated 10 million hectares have already been reduced to ash. At least 28 people and more than a billion animals are believed to have been killed by the fires as of mid-January.,Support has been pouring in from the international community, including Japan, which dispatched two Air Self-Defense Force planes and personnel to Australia earlier this month.,“Climate-related natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly, more destructive, with growing human and financial costs,” Guterres said. “Drought in some parts of the world is progressing at alarming rates, destroying human habitats and endangering food security. … In short, climate change is no longer a long-term problem. We are confronted now with a global climate crisis.”,Average global temperatures are already 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels and, unless the world takes concrete action, average temperatures are on track to rise by an estimated 3 or 4 degrees by the end of the century.,In October 2018, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report that called on the world to keep average global temperatures at no more than 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels, instead of the established 2-degree goal.,Rajib Shaw, a professor at Keio University and one of the lead authors of the report, says the 0.5-degree difference is crucial to many climate-related issues.,Failing to meet the 1.5-degree target, he says, will mean that the number of people exposed to heat waves will more than double from 14 percent to 37 percent of the global population, marine fish stocks will decline by 1.5 million tons and the loss of wildlife species, including vertebrates and plants, will double.,“I believe that the next 10 years will witness extreme levels of climate change and disaster risks,” Shaw says. “Extreme, however, means it usually does not happen and so these risks will no longer be ‘extreme.’ Extreme events will be the new normal.”,The IPCC report also stipulates that the world has until 2030 to cut global emissions of carbon dioxide by about 45 percent from 2010 levels and reach net zero by around 2050 to stop global warming at 1.5 degrees. In December, however, it was revealed that global emissions are still on the rise; 2019’s carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase by 0.6 percent compared to 2018, reaching a record high of 36.8 billion tons.,Sixty-five countries have so far committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Major emitters such as Japan, however, have not.,“Even if countries pledge not to emit carbon dioxide anymore, we cannot change the current situation immediately. It took decades to get to where we are now, so it will take time to change the climate again,” Shaw says. “That’s why mitigation is important, but equally important is adaptation because we have to live with this current state.”,During the U.N. conference in December, Japan joined a list of countries that received the satirical “Fossil of the Day” award by an international environmental organization after failing to commit to stop the nation’s reliance on coal-fired power generation.,Guterres has called on countries to stop building new coal-fired plants from 2020, criticizing the Asia region’s “addiction to coal.”,Japan is the only Group of Seven nation that is still in the process of constructing new plants, although Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi at least admits that he is aware of the issue.,While Japan has stopped short of promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a few local governments have begun to make decarbonization declarations. As of Jan. 20, 51 municipalities — including Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka and Iwate prefectures, as well as cities such as Kyoto, Kagoshima and Ikoma in Nara, have pledged net zero carbon emissions within the next 30 years.,“Zero carbon cities are increasing rapidly throughout Japan,” Koizumi said during the December news conference. “The awakening of local governments should continue, ultimately leading Japan to introduce more renewable energy and become a driving force for the country to realize a decarbonized society.”,A storm surge caused by Typhoon Hagibis pounds the coast of Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture, in October 2019. KYODO,Japan is the world’s fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the U.S., India and Russia. The government has pledged to cut emissions by 26 percent from 2013 levels to 1.042 billion tons by 2030.,So far, Japan has succeeded in reducing emissions for five consecutive years to 1.244 billion tons in fiscal 2018, marking the lowest level since fiscal 1990, when the government began collecting data.,The Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 at a U.N. conference on climate change and has been ratified by 187 countries and territories, including Japan. The accord establishes an international framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 2020, replacing its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol.,Satoru Morishita, vice minister for global environmental affairs at the Environment Ministry, promises to meet this ambitious goal. “Japan has declared that it will achieve decarbonization after 2050, which means it will cut carbon dioxide emitted — not only from thermal coal, but also from natural gas — to carbon neutral,” Morishita says. “When Japan says it will do something, it will.”,A key area in which the government is focused on is innovation of technology such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, as well as the development of hydrogen energy, which does not produce carbon dioxide.,Meanwhile, Japanese corporations, especially those in the financial industry, are also playing a major role in tackling climate change, Morishita says.,In December, the Japan Business Federation unveiled a new initiative called “challenge zero” to promote and support companies taking innovative steps to create a decarbonized society in line with the government’s policy. Participating organizations would either pledge to innovate, install or diffuse net zero carbon technology, or invest in such companies.,“The financial industry is well aware of the looming climate-change crisis,” Morishita says. “If global warming continues and becomes 4 degrees higher than preindustrial levels, too many natural disasters would occur and insurance for damages (from such events) would cease to exist. The sector is very worried about such a scenario.”,Environmental experts such as Itaru Yasui, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, generally agree the world needs to take immediate measures to cut carbon emissions but they also acknowledge the difficulty of achieving this in the wake of the triple core meltdown in Fukushima after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.,Since the disaster, public sentiment has turned against nuclear power, making it hard for politicians to promote it as an energy source in spite of its zero carbon emissions. Many of the country’s nuclear power plants remain idle and, instead, lawmakers have turned to coal. Since 2012, Japan has reportedly unveiled plans to build 50 new coal-fired power stations nationwide.,Before the disaster, nuclear energy accounted for about 30 percent of Japan’s overall power supply, and the government had planned to increase this percentage to about half by 2030.,Instead, nuclear energy accounted for just 2 percent of the country’s total supply in 2016, while coal increased from 27 percent in 2010 to 33 percent in 2016, according to data compiled by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy in 2018.,“It’s important to find a good balance between economic development and environmental protection, but this is actually extremely difficult,” Yasui says. “Japan is stuck between a rock and a hard place because it cannot rely on nuclear energy anymore.”,Like numerous other countries around the world, Japan has also observed its fair share of extreme weather in recent years.,In 2018, Japan endured a record heat wave that at one point pushed temperatures up to 41.1 degrees Celsius. According to the health ministry, 1,581 people died as a result of heat-related complications that year, more than double the number of heat-related deaths the previous year.,Torrential rain also struck western Japan the same summer, resulting in 237 deaths as a consequence of floods and landslides.,Two devastating typhoons — Faxai and Hagibis — also tore through Japan last fall. Typhoon Faxai struck the Kanto region in September, cutting power to 934,900 homes. A month later, Typhoon Hagibis tore through the same region, damaging more than 90,000 homes and killing 99 people. Three people are still missing as of Jan. 10.,“There is something wrong with the state of the world today and typhoons will only get worse,” Yasui says.,From the state of the weather to agriculture and fisheries, climate change is affecting people’s lives. According to the Environment Ministry, rising temperatures and increasing rainfall have resulted in immature rice grains as well as mandarin oranges whose skin and fruit separated, negatively affecting their quality. Tiger mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever were once found in the Kanto region but they have since been detected much farther north as temperatures have risen across the country. And as we’ve known for many years, the ocean’s coral is dying off due to rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification.,In June 2018, Japan passed the Climate Change Adaptation Law, which stipulates that a plan must be drafted to promote measures to adapt to the negative impact of global warming.,“We need to look to the future — 10, 20 years ahead — and continue to adapt to changes as well,” Morishita says. “The same goes for disaster prevention. Instead of looking back at the past, we need to predict what will happen in the next 50 years and establish both hard and soft infrastructure. It would be as significant as the Copernican Revolution.”,From plastic waste and gender inequality to poverty and global conflict, climate change is just one of a number of pressing issues the world currently faces. To overcome these challenges, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September 2015.,According to this initiative, both developing and developed nations have until 2030 — another 10 years — to achieve the 17 goals, which include such things as good health, quality education, protection of biodiversity in the ocean and on land, gender equality and climate action. The initiative replaces its predecessor, the millennium development goals that ended in 2015 and focused more on issues developing nations faced such as poverty and child mortality.,“The SDGs are not just about social and economic problems. There is the added risk of climate change,” Shaw says. “Be it direct or not, climate change affects all of the 17 SDGs.”,Many young people, led by environmental Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, have also begun to take a stand against the climate crisis across the globe.,has gained attention in Japan as well but the number of participants is still low compared to other nations.,Yasui, who is also president of the Institute for Promoting Sustainable Societies, urges more Japanese youth to demand action against climate change. Otherwise, he says, the world is almost certainly going to be in worse shape when Thunberg’s generation turns 50.,“Humans are a truly dangerous species. We are alive because of the Earth and, if something happens to it, we won’t be able to survive,” Yasui says. “The Earth doesn’t exist for our convenience. If we act selfishly, it will break down.”,COURTESY OF ITARU YASUI"

			,Kyodo,Japanese lodging businesses struggling to recover from the damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic have been offering exclusive use of vacation homes and other facilities to those looking for a safe home-away-from-home experience amid the spread of COVID-19.,Many properties are remodeled homes or company dormitories that had been left vacant or had become dilapidated, and with bookings accepted from only one party for the entire facility per day, they make for unique retreats for people seeking seclusion.,
,The facilities are quietly gaining popularity, mainly among families making steady requests for reservations, with users able to enjoy their privacy and avoid physical contact with strangers.,Tabino Recipe Co., a travel agency based in Sendai, operates about 20 mountain villas — all stand-alone houses, many of which were built decades ago — in Zao, Miyagi Prefecture, an area considered one of the country’s leading summer retreats.,The company boasts of facilities furnished with , hot spring baths in villas that are thoroughly cleaned for their guests, adding to the sense of special treatment.,Development of onsen vacation resorts in the town of Zao flourished during the mid-1970s to ’80s. But because of the economic downturn and aging of the properties’ owners, many of the buildings fell into disuse.,From 2014, Tabino Recipe began a house rental business, leasing and buying up villas, after considering the recent trend in the market to utilize vacant homes.,Guests prepare their own meals, and stays, including for single users, cost around ¥15,000 ($130) to ¥50,000 for a building. There is a limit on the number of people each facility can accommodate.,Initially, the houses were popular destinations for foreign tourists fond of skiing and other outdoor activities, but nearly all reservations dried up amid the pandemic.,However, starting in the summer of 2020, based largely on word of mouth, the company began getting a fresh stream of domestic reservations, mainly from guests bringing their families for overnight stays or longer getaways.,Some of the campaign ads for the rental homes in Miyagi Prefecture are limited to and specifically target local residents in vacation plans, touting them as places to avoid the “three Cs” — closed spaces, crowded places and close-contact settings — a phrase widely used in Japan as a means of helping to prevent COVID-19 infections.,A 41-year-old woman from the city of Yamagata who stayed at the Zao resort with five family members said she had refrained from traveling for over a year because of the pandemic, but felt refreshed after finally getting away from home.,“We had a luxurious time together,” she said.,Tabino Recipe currently operates about 60 such buildings, including cottages and apartments, in four prefectures — Miyagi, Kanagawa, Kyoto, and Okinawa. Property owners benefit from the extra income as well as the reduced burden of having to manage their homes.,“People’s needs are increasing as they want to make sure they feel secure when they travel,” said Masahiko Hosoya, a senior official from the company. “We’ve also had a favorable reception from homeowners who appreciate the efficient use of houses they are unable to fully maintain themselves.”,A three-story building that had been used as a company dormitory was remodeled by a separate rental housing operator and opened in March last year in Toba, Mie Prefecture, a coastal city renowned as a mecca for oyster farming and seafood.,The facility, called “Anchor — Fisherman’s Hideout,” has seven bedrooms, each with a balcony and oceanside view, and accepts only one reservation per day for the entire facility with a capacity of 29 guests.,It temporarily closed immediately after opening due to the pandemic but has seen a recent surge in guests, particularly reservations from families and groups of friends or coworkers, after gaining a reputation for being a haven away from contact with unfamiliar people. Guests booked the facility for the entire summer.,For up to five guests, there is a flat fee of ¥60,500 and ¥5,500 per person for any additional guests to use the facility, including an 85-square-meter living room, featuring a large wood-burning stove, and another area for barbecues.,“Even under the pandemic, there are many people who wish to create memories together with their friends,” said Shimpei Yukino, 35, the owner of the facility.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,From Fukinosan-Hozoin Temple, a trail snakes its way through the upper reaches of Mount Fukino, passing moss-mantled stone statues that lurk beneath cedar, cypress and mountain blossoms like impish spirits plotting to startle passersby.,During the Edo Period (1603–1868), colliers from the Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture plied this route, felling hardwood trees for charcoal to sell at markets as far as Edo, present-day Tokyo, 200 kilometers away.,
,Further back, when the temple was established in the western Izu town of Matsuzaki 1,200 years ago by revered Buddhist monk and scholar Kukai, aka Kobo Daishi (774–835), mountain mystics called , roamed this sylvan way in their sedulous search for enlightenment.,Clues to the highway’s past are found in the remnants of charcoal kilns and the stone idols, among them the Bato Kannon, guardian of horses and warriors and protector against calamity, who is often depicted as a horse with a pious-looking figure mounted on its back.,
,
,Today, the deity is charged with the safe passage of pilgrims straddling a more contemporary vehicle as they traverse this ancient highway, which lay neglected and all but forgotten for over half a century.,Matsuzaki resident Keitaro Heima first heard about it as a child from his grandfather, and in 2013 joined forces with a group of likeminded outdoors enthusiasts eager to restore the route, this time as a mountain-bike trail.,“Its history means it offers a little more than your average mountain-bike trail,” says Heima, who conducts a variety of guided tours along a 46-kilometer portion of the trail, the toughest “Epic Ride” starting from Fukinosan-Hozoin, 550 meters above sea level. “Izu is a magnet for cyclists, and this adds something unique to the mix.”,Yamabushi Trail Tours is among a range of cycling courses on the peninsula that have been augmented with essential infrastructure by municipalities in a quest to make Izu Japan’s cycling mecca.,There’s stiff competition, notably Ehime Prefecture’s 1,300-kilometer “complete cycling route,” which includes the Shimanami Kaido, a 75-kilometer journey that hops its way over some of the hundreds of islands that dot the Seto Inland Sea via a series of bridges.,
,
,The Shimanami, which links Ehime and Hiroshima prefectures, has garnered significant attention since being selected by one travel website as being among the world’s best seven cycling routes.,Izu arguably offers a more varied cycling experience, and a pedigree that adds weight to its ambitious goal.,In 1965, on the back of the 1961 Sports Promotion Law and the 1964 Tokyo Olympics — which triggered a domestic cycling boom — the Japan Cycling Sports Center (CSC) opened in the Shuzenji hot-spring resort, part of today’s Izu City, combining cycling-themed amusement park rides with road (and later mountain bike) courses.,Three years on, Japan’s only , school was inaugurated close by and, in 2011, the nation’s first velodrome was unveiled within the CSC grounds, which are set amid lush woodland with iconic Mount Fuji forming a majestic backdrop. A second velodrome was added to the keirin school in 2019.,
,
,The 2000s saw a surge of cycling-related initiatives in the area. In 2002, the Continental Cycling Center Shuzenji was established by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) as one of eight elite cycling centers worldwide charged with training cyclists from each continent to compete in global events such as the Olympics and UCI World Championships.,In 2005, meanwhile, the Izu stage was added to the UCI-sanctioned Tour of Japan, the nation’s biggest professional road race.,Izu’s inclusion in the tour spawned other events, including the Cycle Festival Izu, which runs in tandem with the tour and offers a variety of cycling-themed activities at multiple locations on the peninsula.,It was, however, the addition of Izu as a 2020 Olympics host venue that shifted the ambitious project into an entirely different gear, says Yasuo Goto, a cycling guide and manager of Izu Velo, a bicycle rental service located outside Shuzenji Station.,“Izu has long been known as a holiday resort, and cycling a sort of niche side attraction,” he says. “Being chosen for the Olympics changed that.”,
,
,Izu initially caught the eye of Tokyo Olympics organizers, when, faced with escalating costs, they were pressed by the International Olympic Committee to find alternative venues to those initially earmarked for Japan’s capital, among them a new, nonpermanent velodrome.,Located less than two hours from Tokyo, Izu Velodrome was a shoo-in solution. Since completion a decade ago, countless competitions have been held on its internationally approved 250-meter track, according to CSC’s Kazuhiro Sato. More importantly, it would save almost ¥11 billion in construction costs.,Not that Izu Velodrome was a freebie. In 2018, it underwent significant upgrades, including a doubling of its original seating capacity to 3,600 — still well short of the 6,750-seater Lee Valley Velopark built for the 2012 London Olympics, or the 5,000-capacity Velodromo Municipal do Rio constructed for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.,A new elevator and other adjustments to improve accessibility were also implemented, part of a city-wide effort to ramp up inclusivity and diversity programs, which included the passing of legislation in 2019 that made signing for people with hearing difficulties an official language.,Izu City was also selected to host mountain biking events, though here, too, a facelift to a pre-existing course within CSC was required to bring it up to Games standards.,
,
,Costs for those mostly temporary upgrades alone were reportedly close to ¥7 billion, though the initial postponement of the Games and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic — overall countermeasures for which were estimated at ¥100 billion — inflated that figure.,While the announcement in March that no international visitors would be allowed to attend the Olympics was certainly a blow, local authorities remained optimistic about the long-term benefits.,In 2019, Shizuoka Prefecture set up a review committee to look into the legacy of Tokyo 2020, in particular how sites such as the CSC and the Fuji Speedway, which hosted the final stage of the road race, could be exploited in the quest to become Japan’s cycling hub.,Central among the four subcommittees established was one charged with expanding cycle tourism and another tackling cycling-related infrastructure development.,What became clear was that the Izu area was already speeding ahead in those two areas.,In addition to supporting four rental cycle startups, including Izu Velo, municipalities have unveiled dozens of courses of varying levels, each introduced via comprehensive cycling maps and indicated by a system of chevrons on the sides of roads.,
,
,Meanwhile, around 200 “bicycle pits” at public facilities, parks and businesses — including convenience stores, cafes and restaurants — offer cycle racks, pumps and repair kits, while vending machines stock inner tubes and other cycling essentials, says Shigenori Watanabe of the Izu Development Association, a regional tourism association also charged with bringing together public and private entities to develop new initiatives.,“Some buses and trains feeding the area sport bicycle racks, and local taxi companies have retrofitted their fleets to similarly assist cyclists, even in an emergency,” he says.,Indeed, an increasing number of local entities are jumping onboard, he adds, with some cyclist-friendly cafes and restaurants becoming information exchange hubs for domestic cyclists and others from overseas who visit or train at the keirin school, though the COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably led to a fall in numbers.,Another gathering spot is the cavernous X Base in Izunokuni City, which offers cycling tours and workshops and bike rental from renowned Taiwanese bicycle manufacturer Merida’s extensive lineup.,“There was a fall in visitors after the state of emergency was announced, but conversely the proportion of those renting and wanting to give road cycling a try has grown, especially since emergency measures have been eased,” says Masahiro Shinagawa, manager of X Base, which also offers changing and hot-spring bathing facilities. “The infrastructure and cycling culture that has developed here makes Izu a great place to start.”,
,
,Also in Izunokuni, Kona Stay is one of four accommodations on the peninsula catering to cyclists. Stylishly converted from a traditional , inn, Kona Stay features a bicycle repair space, rental area and bicycle racks in each room.,Before the emergence of COVID-19, the inn had been welcoming an increasing number of overseas visitors and, in recent months, foreign residents have started to emerge among the guests from within the prefecture who are returning to the area, says Kona Stay’s Emi Suzuki.,Many who visit specifically for cycling bring along their own bicycles and test their mettle in the 240-kilometer Izu Isshu (Izu Circuit), Suzuki adds.,Of the peninsula’s varied lineup of courses, the circuit is high on many a cycling enthusiast’s bucket list. It features a total ascent greater than Mount Fuji’s 3,776-meter elevation and an officially estimated completion time of 10 hours — an “irresistible challenge” for many riders, she says.,While some take up the gauntlet, others prefer a more measured approach, breaking along the way at places such as Kona Stay and sampling some of the local delights, including fresh seafood, golden beaches and a plethora of hot springs for a muscle-soothing post-cycle soak.,This has been a popular approach during Izu Ichi, an annual two-day cycling bonanza and one of numerous cycling events co-organized by the Izu Development Association and the Shizuoka-headquartered Suruga Bank. The circuit course is undoubtedly the showpiece, but a truncated 60-kilometer iteration is also offered.,
,
,Both are introduced via the recently launched Cycleball mobile app that includes numerous other shorter rides, such as the leisurely 50-kilometer coastal course starting from historic Shimoda. Each takes in some of the best of Izu’s seductive scenery, from the beaches of the southeast and dramatic coastal rock formations of the west to the lush mountain scenery, cascading waterfalls and eroded volcanoes of the interior.,The prime objective of the Izu Development Association and Suruga Bank venture is to bolster efforts to promote and develop cycling tourism on the peninsula under the IDA-initiated “Cycling Resort Izu” banner, says Suruga Bank’s cycling project captain, Toshiaki Fukada.,“Izu has a reputation as a place for rest and recreation, especially for stressed-out urbanites,” said Fukada as he greeted participants in the 90-kilometer “West Izu Ride,” which kicks off from one of three “cycle stations” in Izu City, this one a renovated Suruga Bank branch that boasts a kitchen, sitting area and changing rooms.,“The health benefits of cycling, both physical and mental, are well documented, and cycling outdoors amid natural surroundings such as those offered on the peninsula only enhances those benefits,” he says.,Most participants in the non-competitive events come from fast-paced business hubs in and around the Tokyo metropolitan area, although local enthusiasts are increasingly clicking their cleats.,
,
,On this occasion they included local illustrator Yoko Iwamoto, who has developed a unique perspective for her art, thanks to a chance encounter with the globe’s most prestigious road race 20 years ago.,“The first thing I noticed when I started road cycling was the wonderful scenery and local culture, which I had previously taken for granted,” says Iwamoto, whose interest in cycling was piqued during a study year in Paris when she happened upon a Tour de France-related event. “What I saw from the saddle seemed to make a longer-lasting impression.”,She devised a compact illustrator’s kit consisting of a small sketchbook, retractable brushes and watercolors squashed into an old makeup box that would neatly fit into her saddlebag. She soon became a familiar sight around Izu, earning her the nickname “the cycling illustrator.”,The scenes she painted became an integral element of Iwamoto’s art, culminating in a colorful and playful collection of works in her 2018 book “Jitensha de Meguru Shizuoka Sukechi-cho” (“Sketchbook of Travels Around Shizuoka by Bicycle”).,“Up until Paris, I was like many people in the area for whom bikes were just a means to get from A to B,” says Iwamoto, who currently has an exhibition in Hamaoka, Shizuoka Prefecture, featuring 200 of her works. “What I saw on the Champs-Elysees was a ‘cycling for all’ event where people of all ages were simply enjoying themselves. It completely altered my perspective.”,
,
,While parts of Izu are hilly and demanding and better suited to more seasoned cyclists such as Iwamoto, officials are keen to highlight the peninsula’s own “cycling for all” potential.,An increasingly popular area for casual riders is the Kano River, which boasts a dozen cycling courses ranging from 8 kilometers to 94 kilometers in length, the longest running the entire length of the river from Shuzenji to Numazu at the northwest gateway to the peninsula.,Strapping on helmets and switching on e-bikes, a group of daytrippers follows Izu Velo’s Goto on one of the tours, which takes in lush, mountain-backed scenery, , paddies and fishermen thigh-deep in the Kano River casting their lines for , sweet fish.,Further on we stop at a bend in the river where, on a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji — one of more than 30 views of Japan’s sacred symbol in this part of the Izu Peninsula. Apart from a few gentle rises, the route is as flat as the shimmering Kano River.,Despite its relatively small land mass, Izu is replete with natural, cultural and historical attractions, says Goto, 72, as we return to base in Shuzenji for a well-deserved dip in one of its hot springs, which, legend says, were magicked into existence by Kobo Daishi to help a filial son cure his ailing father.,“Much of it can be enjoyed from the saddle of a bike,” he says. “That’s a big reason I think Izu can achieve its goal and become Japan’s cycling mecca.”,
,
,The availability of e-bikes at rental stores and retrofitted buses covering some of the region’s hillier parts means even those who visit without really intending to go cycling can give it a go, he adds.,According to Kona Stay’s Suzuki such riders have been on the rise in recent months, largely thanks to a prefectural campaign encouraging local residents to travel.,“Consequently many rent out bicycles to explore the area,” she says.,There is even a hope that an increase in casual cyclists will help redress an ironic anomaly. According to a national census, only 2% of Izu residents use bicycles, says Izu City official Yuji Umehara, who headed up a division promoting Izu’s Olympics and Paralympics events.,“Residents don’t consider bicycles a means of getting around,” Umehara says, adding that the area’s hilly terrain is the main contributing factor.,There’s hope that the likes of Izu Velo will not only attract casual visitors, but also become a place where locals, too, try their hand at cycling, he says. “The core idea is to make Izu cyclist friendly to visitors and locals alike.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Staff writer,Yoshiharu Hoshino is known as a maverick in the hospitality industry, an innovative entrepreneur with a progressive management style who transformed his family-owned inn into one of the nation’s largest and best-known operators of luxury hotels and , (traditional inns).,Riding on a boom of inbound visitors in recent years, Hoshino Resorts Inc. had been steadily expanding its footprint in both Japan and overseas — until COVID-19 hit.,
,During the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, seven of the 42 properties it operated were temporarily closed as both domestic and international travel came to an abrupt halt. Five Hoshino Resorts properties that had been planned to open during March and June were postponed. And during April and May, when the country’s first state of emergency was declared, profits plunged by 80% to 90%.,To quell his employees’ concerns, Hoshino conjured up an 18-month survival plan in April that year, laying out the expected correlation between travel demand and infection rates on the assumption that vaccines and/or cures would be ready toward the end of 2021.,“Things went as planned, and we were able to weather the pandemic delivering satisfactory results,” Hoshino says. “But what I didn’t anticipate was how the health crisis didn’t end with a second dose. Now we have omicron.”,
,
,Just as the battered travel and tourism industry thought it saw a light at the end of the tunnel, it is being rattled again as nations introduce flight restrictions to contain the spread of the new variant.,Less than a month after easing border controls in November, the Japanese government imposed new bans for inbound international visitors to the dismay of travelers, airlines and hotel operators alike. As of early January, it remains unclear when the restrictions will be lifted. Meanwhile, the number of reported coronavirus cases are seeing a spike, raising concern of a new wave of infections.,Still, with COVID-19 treatment pills starting to be distributed to medical institutions and the nation rolling out its third round of vaccinations, Hoshino and others in the sector are hopeful that travel will regain its footing this year while incorporating the lessons learned from the past two tumultuous years.,“We will need to monitor how the situation with omicron evolves … but I’m optimistic that inbound travel will return leading up to the 2025 World Expo,” Hoshino says.,The fourth-generation hotelier predicts that compared to 2019 when a record-high 31.88 million foreign visitors came to Japan, inbound volume will return to 15% this year, 40% in 2023, 70% in 2024 and 100% in 2025, when Osaka will host the international extravaganza.,“Meanwhile, I believe the domestic tourism market will continue to recover as looser restrictions are applied to concerts, theaters, bars and restaurants, to name a few — steps that will bring tourists back to the cities” he says. “I’m sure 2022 will be better than last year for the tourism industry.”,If there’s one trend kick-started by COVID-19 that will continue impacting travel and tourism in the post-pandemic world, it’s probably the rapid proliferation of remote work, and the new possibilities and pitfalls it poses.,On the one hand, business travel appears doomed, as corporations cut back on travel budgets and carbon emissions. A , last year of 45 large businesses in the United States, Europe and Asia, for example, showed that 84% of respondents plan to spend less on travel following the pandemic, with a majority of the respondents cutting travel budgets seeing reductions of between 20% and 40%, with about 2 in 3 slashing both internal and external in-person meetings.,“Flexible working arrangements are weighing on business travel demand in Japan. The commuting population is shrinking and business trips are being replaced by online meetings,” says Toru Azuma, a professor at Rikkyo University’s College of Tourism.,“That means transportation operators will need to stir demand for tourism to make up for the shortfall,” he says.,
,
,Under such circumstances, the nation’s two full-service carriers are both strengthening ties with low-cost carriers.,ANA Holdings Inc., the parent company of All Nippon Airways Co., is planning to launch a new low-cost carrier brand toward the end of the next fiscal year, with flights connecting Japan with Southeast Asia and Oceania. Its rival, Japan Airlines Co., meanwhile, made Chinese low-cost carrier Spring Airlines Japan Co. a consolidated subsidiary to offer services alongside JAL’s wholly owned budget airline Zipair Tokyo Inc.,“While the spread of the omicron variant could disrupt future scenarios, I believe the airline industry is expecting international travel to return in 2023,” Azuma says. “That means this year is when they need to recuperate from the massive losses they incurred from COVID-19 by resuming domestic air travel in earnest.”,There will be several steps necessary for international travel to take off again. While Japan’s booster rollout has begun, it will take months for it to reach the general population. Meanwhile, municipalities are starting to accept registrations from businesses for the so-called vaccine-test package — an initiative that would allow people who present proof of being vaccinated or testing negative for COVID-19 to enter bars, restaurants and other establishments within usual business hours with no restriction on the headcount of the party. The government, however, has expressed caution at introducing the program amid the recent surge in COVID-19 infections.,“Border restrictions will need to be loosened and quarantine periods shortened for arrivals,” Azuma says. “Finally, the public will have to be more tolerant of foreign visitors, who many believe to be responsible for bringing the disease into the country.”,Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s decision to enact swift border controls was partly in response to criticism his predecessor received for contributing to the spread of the virus by being too slow in dealing with such measures. While Kishida’s move has gained popular backing according to polls, the tough response has also drawn anguish from the international community for singling out foreign visitors.,The government, meanwhile, hopes to ramp up domestic tourism by resuming the state-sponsored Go To Travel campaign, which, according to initial drafts, will subsidize up to 30% of total costs through discounts. While the previous program was suspended in December 2020 when case counts soared, it was still lauded as a success with some 90 million people taking part and boosting much-needed consumption.,The campaign also supplemented micro-tourism, or staycations, a concept that Hoshino Resorts was among the front-runners in promoting. With long-distance travel frowned upon, a growing number of hoteliers and municipalities have been calling for residents to seek out accommodation and tourist attractions only one or two hours away from their homes by car as a means to energize local economies while minimizing virus contagion risks.,“The idea was a big hit, and I don’t think we could have survived without it,” Hoshino says, with hot-spring retreats in the countryside fairing especially well compared to establishments in cities. “During states of emergency and even now with the omicron variant, micro-tourism has been underpinning demand.”,
,
,Before the pandemic, for example, around half of the guests at Hoshinoya Kyoto, an up-scale ryokan in Japan’s former capital operated by Hoshino Resorts, were from overseas. Through the promotion of micro-tourism, the percentage of local guests from the Kinki region grew from below 10% to nearly 40% in 2020, according to the company, and the overall occupancy rate was maintained at roughly 80%.,Hoshino has been emphasizing the importance of domestic tourists, who spent a combined total of ¥22 trillion in 2019. That’s compared to ¥4.8 trillion spent by inbound foreign travelers in the same year, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. And the change in work styles spurred by teleworking could offer new opportunities for travel in Japan, he says.,“When looking at the domestic tourism market, demand is excessive for roughly 100 days of the year, mostly concentrated during Japan’s holiday seasons, including over new year. Meanwhile, supply is excessive for the rest of the 265 days,” Hoshino says. “The spread of ‘workations’ and other flexible working arrangements harbors the potential to create demand during these 265 days.”,In November, for example, East Japan Railway Co. launched onboard “office cars” for certain shinkansen bullet train lines connecting Tokyo with the nation’s northern and central regions in the hopes that the service will help encourage workation trips while stimulating demand for business trips. Numerous hotels and ryokans have also been offering workation packages, while corporations are promoting workation programs for its employees.,
,
,“Yes, there are firms reverting back to old working habits, but remote work is definitely making inroads, especially among the younger generation,” says Hiroshi Kurosu, a research fellow at JTB Tourism Research. “In that sense, I feel micro-tourism could stick, as people opt to spend more time and money at destinations in relatively close proximity rather than going out of their way to places farther away.”,Backing the trend, Kurosu says, is a shift in consumer habits stemming from Japan’s prolonged economic stagnation. Compared to the excessive spending synonymous with the asset price bubble of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ensuing decades saw travel spending shrink as people tightened their purse strings and focused on their daily lives, Kurosu says.,“But the proliferation of remote work appears to be prompting many to rethink their quality of life,” he says. “Rather than hastily spending one night over the weekend for a short vacation, for example, the newfound flexibility could allow people to spend two or even three nights with a more enhanced experience at destinations closer to home.”,The Go To Travel campaign will also likely offer bigger discounts for travel during the weekdays to avoid trips being concentrated during the weekend. Initially planned to resume in late January or February, the program will likely be delayed further due to the increase in reported infections.,“What’s more, domestic travelers may feel inclined to visit sought-after destinations before inbound tourists return,” Kurosu says.,He warns, however, that “the real question is who will survive once these subsidies and pent-up demand runs dry.”,Attracting and retaining talent while cutting costs has been a major headache for the tourism industry as damaging travel restrictions led to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.,According to the World Travel & Tourism Council’s annual , released in June, Japan’s travel and tourism sector’s contribution to GDP plunged by 37% in 2020, resulting in the loss of 290,200 related jobs across the country.,“Human resources will be crucial for the industry to rebound post-pandemic. It could take years to recruit lost talent,” Hoshino says. “In that sense, the government’s employment adjustment subsidies were helpful in keeping our employees.”,And as travel and tourism players scramble to scrape costs, both the government and the private sector have been promoting so-called digital transformation to minimize labor fees and enhance productivity.,At Hoshino Resorts, for example, the company created its own reservation system supporting the first Go To Travel campaign to help both staff and prospective guests avoid getting mired in complicated application procedures. It also introduced a service allowing users to gauge the congestion of hot springs to lower infection risks.,“There are ‘offensive’ and ‘defensive’ digital transformation, the latter referring to reducing back office operating costs while the former is about improving tourism content using technology such as virtual and augmented reality,” says Tsukasa Sato, head of the new content development promotion office at the Japan Tourism Agency.,“As inbound travelers return, it’s important for various parties involved to create services to avert overcrowding at popular tourist destinations, for example, while attracting repeat visitors,” he says. “Installing customer-management systems in hotels and non-contact payment options are other initiatives we are pushing for.”,As part of its efforts, the tourism agency has been soliciting applications for digitally driven tourism content. One such project premiered in December when Keikyu Electric Railway Co. introduced an open-top sightseeing bus tour featuring VR goggles that let passengers experience the city of Yokohama submerged into the sea and lit up with fireworks.,“The tourism sector was able to secure revenue without having to embrace digitalization when the number of inbound visitors were growing. But now that it can’t count on them, I believe those in the business are finally working on ways to improve productivity and operational efficiency through digital transformation.”,
,
,Despite the pandemic, Hoshino Resorts has managed to continue opening new facilities. On Friday, it opened three hotels in Kyoto and Hokkaido under its budget OMO brand, with more being planned this year. Hoshino is also determined to open his first hot-spring ryokan on the U.S. mainland, a project that could take several years to materialize.,Behind the 108-year-old company’s resilience may be Japan’s history of enduring various disasters, be it earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or viral epidemics.,“I grew up in a hot-spring inn in Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture, which is near Mount Asama,” he says, referring to the 2,568-meter volcano sitting on the border of Gunma and Nagano prefectures.,“And when the mountain erupted, tourists vanished. That’s why it’s important to reduce risks by investing in smaller properties across the nation,” he says. “But we also can’t forget that without volcanoes, we won’t have hot springs.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Go-Toba, Japan’s 82nd emperor, used his time in exile to advance the ancient poetic form known as waka.,COVID-19 has put a pause on travel, but that doesn’t mean we can’t plan. The Japan Times’ Escape page regulars write about where they want to go in Japan once we see the back of COVID-19.,Named for its temple, history and legend flow through Kokubunji.,A dreary drizzle of rain falls on the November day I've set aside for walking out along the Kokubunji gaisen (cliff line) in western Tokyo. Despite the weather, my hope is to catch some late autumn colors, so I yank on my trusty rubber ...,Minutes from Tamachi Station, the area of Shiba, is a maze of weathered watering holes, chain restaurants, karaoke joints and gritty izakaya (Japanese pubs), like an east Tokyo version of Shinjuku's Golden Gai.,From craft goods and antiques to unusual  galettes and premium sake, Tokyo's Mon-Naka neighborhood has it all.,The Kansai area — think Kyoto, Osaka and surrounds — has some of the country's best anaba (little-known spots) where you can encounter the rich depths of Japanese culture, minus the crowds. Reserve one of these nine luxuriously uncrowded options to take your travels ...,From the historic Kajikaen to kimono dyeing studios and the Gyokudo Art Museum, numerous institutions of traditional art and culture line the banks of the Tama River as it runs through Mitake.,Although the streets of Asakusa are familiar stomping grounds for tourists and locals alike, a ride on a jinrikisha (rickshaw) can bring a refreshing new perspective to the historic area, and even reveal a secret spot or two.,Togoshi's local businesses are quirky, wholesome and close-knit. But what truly brings this district together is the coffee shop that supplies them all with bespoke blends.,

			,Contributing writer,Before winter’s rough seas make ferry crossings a gamble, I board a vessel at Shichirui Port in Shimane Prefecture, headed for Nakanoshima in the distant Oki Islands.,It’s not my first exploration of the islands, which offer some of the most spectacular scenery in Japan, but, this time, I’m seeking a deeper understanding of , written by Japan’s 82nd emperor, Go-Toba (1180-1239).,
,During the last 19 years of his life, while he was in exile on Nakanoshima, Go-Toba not only continued his role as editor of the Shin Kokinshu, a collection he conceived of and which was destined to become one of Japan’s most revered collections of waka, but he also wrote poems that give us insight into his character and circumstances.,Waka is an umbrella term for all Japanese poetry, but the same word also identifies a specific traditional poetic form that developed during the Nara Period in the seventh century. The lines in a waka poem are rendered in a rhythmic pattern of 5-7-5-7-7 , (sound units, often erroneously equated with syllables) and openly express emotions of loss, frustration, desire and awe at nature. The confessional content of waka offers great snapshots into the lifestyles and social norms of lettered Japanese.,Waka is also arguably the most popular form of poetry in Japan today, read by millions in Japanese newspaper columns, and featured at the annual televised “Utakai Hajime,” the imperial family’s new year poetry reading, which includes poems selected from public submissions.,
,
,On the ferry deck, I watch as land fades from sight. It is hard not to imagine Go-Toba’s voyage, around 800 years ago, in 1221. At the time, the former emperor was 41, sailing away from all he knew. On the throne from age 3 through 18, Go-Toba was by most accounts a fun-loving, boisterous, socially active young man. The Kamakura shogunate, perhaps noting Go-Toba’s strength, forced him to retire, transferring the title to his son. Officially retired as a teenager, Go-Toba engaged in sports and poetry parties, but still swung weight in court politics. He also commissioned the Shin Kokin Wakashu, a new collection of waka destined to modernize the former Kokin Wakashu (905) collection. The collection included old classics and also cutting-edge works of the time, thereby advancing the poetic form.,What upturned Go-Toba’s life was his bid to wrest back power from the Kamakura shogunate in an attempt to reinstate imperial rule in Kyoto. His plans went swiftly awry, and he was exiled to Nakanoshima. His sons, too, were dispatched to other islands, and he never saw them again.,These days, the ferry only takes about two hours to Nakanoshima, yet the journey is one of dizzying removal from the familiar. The movement of sunlight on the water is mesmerizing, and the sky so wide it puts one’s small human existence into perspective.,As the ferry glides into Nakanoshima’s Hishiura Port Ferry Terminal, located in the town of Ama, I spot the newly built annex wing of Ento Hotel, called Nest, where I have reserved a fine-feathered stay. Checking into the 2021 building, an ultra-clean design by Mount Fuji Architects Studio, I suspect I might not ever want to leave the nest. It’s a surprisingly elegant accommodation for a remote island with a population of approximately 2,000 people. I soon learn that the entire town of Ama has helped fund the hotel, so most islanders have a vested interest in the venture.,
,
,Within my first hours on Nakanoshima, I also discover that most islanders know a lot about Go-Toba and waka, and are happy to share.,Kosuke Takahashi, 60, for example, formerly on the board of education in Ama and currently an expert on the hiking paths forged by Go-Toba, whisks me off at breakneck speed past cowherds, fishing coves and dramatic vistas before stopping at the harbor where Go-Toba first landed in the village of Saki, south of Ama.,When he cuts the car engine, the hamlet of Saki falls nearly silent, save for the sound of lapping waves. A line of frail fishing shacks slouching along the harbor’s edge strikes me as possibly resembling what the exiled emperor and his entourage might have seen when their boats landed.,Go-Toba’s boat had encountered a violent storm, and he is said to have composed a waka in the midst of it:,Given that the Japanese word for “warden” can be also translated to mean “god,” the poem sounds defiantly brave. However, when his entourage came ashore at dusk, no residents were prepared to take them in. Takahashi points out a rock on which Go-Toba is said to have sat while his attendants searched for lodging.,
,
,Ultimately, the former emperor spent his first night in a thatch-roofed shrine on a nearby promontory. Takahashi guides me up a steep path to Miho Shrine, now with a tile roof. Sea hawks cry overhead, and even in midday, the moss-carpeted shrine grounds feel forlorn. Reading a stone carved with a waka Go-Toba is said to have written that night, by moonlight, I sense his apprehension, as his circumstances came into focus.,Takahashi zips me back to Ama, where I tour the small Go-Toba Museum, featuring a replica of the former emperor’s last will, stamped with red imprints of his hands. There are also several illustrated versions of “Go-Toba-in Ento Hyakushu” (“Go-Toba’s 100 Verses from a Distant Island”). Nearby, I pay respects at the site of Go-Toba’s cremation, then offer a prayer at Oki Shrine, built a century ago to honor his memory.,Finally I peek into the wooden home of the Murakami family, who were charged with Go-Toba’s welfare during his exile. Because Go-Toba’s lodgings were lost in a fire, the Murakami house is all I have to conjure the likely basic living quarters the exiled emperor was offered. More than one of his waka gives voice to his grievances:,
,
,In fact, many of Go-Toba’s island waka are, unsurprisingly, laments — but such poems, known as ,, were a popular category of waka. When I spy among the Murakami House’s scant displays a deerskin , ball, used in a kind of kickball game which Go-Toba greatly enjoyed — I wonder if perhaps Go-Toba had more fun on Nakanoshima than is commonly imagined?,I chat about this with 74-year-old Shinya Sakakibara on Ama’s Counsel for Protection of Cultural Properties and the priest of Miho Shrine, and later his 42-year-old daughter, Yuki. Both are experts on Go-Toba’s poetry.,The Sakakibaras point out that Go-Toba observed island life carefully. Both mention several waka that celebrate the island’s beauty, and teach me one that most islanders have memorized:,
,
,Back at the Go-Toba Museum, which functions as a lively meeting place for islanders, I have the fortune to meet one of Nakanoshima’s local seafolk, Takeshi Sasaka.,Sasaka, a 50-year-old teacher-turned-fisherman, has won three Shimane Prefecture waka contests, and credits his interaction with the island’s natural elements as his muse.,“First, I observe, then when I find myself moved by what I see, I need to find the words for that,” he says. This might sound simple, but I envision Go-Toba doing the same, finding an essence of liberation in the process.,Later, relaxing in the clean austerity of my room at Ento Hotel, I gaze out an enormous picture window. Ferries arrive and depart, and slowly a full moon rises. I get to thinking about how during the past couple of years, each of us has had a taste of exile. The island convinces me to let this emotion flow through my pen.,Japan Times contributors Alice Gordenker and Kit Nagamura will give a lecture titled “Japan’s Poetry Islands: Emperor Go-Toba, Waka Poetry and the Oki Islands” on Feb. 26.

			,Contributing/staff writer,Ask any skier or snowboarder for their list of must-visit winter destinations, and Japan will invariably feature.,“Nowhere in the world is there snow quite like it,” says a skier at the Hakuba Happo-One ski resort after more than 1 meter of snow fell in 48 hours during the opening week of January. “It’s fast, deep and just keeps coming.”,
,With mountains covering more than 70% of the country and some of the world’s heaviest snowfall, skiing is both an integral part of Japanese culture and a magnet for winter sports enthusiasts.,Yet, Japan has had a tumultuous love affair with the sport and resorts now face a number of long-term threats — from declining interest in snow sports to climate change — that have been compounded by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.,The domestic ski boom of the 1980s, fueled by the economic bubble and bookended by the 1972 Sapporo and 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, led to a record 18 million skiers and snowboarders visiting the 700-plus ski resorts that dotted the country in 1998.,“When I was a child, Hakuba was a smaller ski resort run by local people,” says Toshiro Maruyama, who was born and raised in Hakuba and runs the , Shirouma-so Ryokan that his grandfather started 85 years ago. “However, with the bubble era and then the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, I experienced the ski boom first hand.”,
,
,When that bubble burst, so too did the business models of many of those resorts. By 2016, there were , and the number of resorts nationwide had fallen to around 500, many of which housed outdated infrastructure and were running with huge operating costs and spiraling debt.,“In the early 2000s, we had a very serious financial situation and we needed to find a solution that would bring tourists back to Hakuba,” says Yojiro Fukushima, director of the Tourism Commission of Hakuba Village.,“We realized that the Japanese economy was showing no signs of bouncing back, so we decided to promote Hakuba abroad, particularly in Australia,” Fukushima says. More recently, these promotional efforts have also targeted tourists from Asian markets such as China, Singapore and Hong Kong.,Before the pandemic, inbound skiers were a growing market, helping to stabilize the decline in domestic interest. Between 2013 and 2018, the number of inbound skiers in Japan increased from around 300,000 to more than 880,000.,The money that these winter sports enthusiasts brought to Japan helped to bolster local economies. According to the Japan Tourism Agency, inbound tourists for winter sports spend an average of ¥225,000 during their stay in Japan, compared to an average of ¥153,000 among inbound tourists in general.,Shirouma-so, which was initially a humble lodging catering to farmers and whose lobby still rests on the 300-year-old wooden beams that used to be part of the original farmhouse, has been extremely successful in attracting an international clientele.,“In 2010, foreign customers made up about 10% of guests in the winter season. By 2018, this had risen to 80%,” Maruyama says.,“Japanese guests usually only book for weekends or during the holiday periods, whereas international customers tend to stay longer, which is a lot better for business,” adds Maruyama, who notes that his business almost doubled between 2008 and 2018 as the international market grew.,
,
,Ski resorts such as Hakuba and Nozawa Onsen in Nagano Prefecture, and Niseko in Hokkaido, have led the way in marketing themselves and Japan’s now world-renowned powder snow — known as “Japow” — which is famed for being consistently dry and falling in copious amounts.,Sapporo, the nearest major city to Niseko, , if its bid is accepted by the International Olympic Committee.,
,The increasing significance of international guests to ski resorts has led to mounting concern about the effects of Japan’s strict COVID-19 border measures — which currently prevent tourists from entering the country — as they extend into a second winter season.,“Hakuba Valley has 10 ski resorts that cater to around 1.5 million skiers per year, of which 380,000 were international guests in 2018,” Fukushima says. “We were expecting this number to continue increasing.”,However, the much anticipated 2020-21 ski season, which was predicted to bring a record number of foreign guests due to a spillover effect from the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, failed to materialize after border restrictions were introduced in spring 2020 in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.,The damage caused by the halt in international tourism was compounded by the country’s subsequent states of emergency, which scuttled plans for domestic tourists.,“Only 800,000 guests came to Hakuba during the winter of 2020-21, which amounts to less than half of what we were receiving in pre-pandemic times,” Fukushima says.,
,
,Niseko has been hit with similarly dismal numbers in the past two years.,“In the 2019 fiscal year, which includes the full 2019-2020 winter season, around 1.7 million tourists stayed in the Niseko area, approximately 550,000 of whom were foreign visitors,” says Mitchel Lange, coordinator of international relations at the Industry and Tourism Division of the Niseko Town Hall. “In the 2020 fiscal year, however, we had about 619,000 guests, of which only 21,000 were foreign visitors.”,Although a snowy start to 2022 and an uptick in domestic tourism , has led to optimism for the 2021-22 season, the situation remains dire for many resorts, and the recent surge in omicron cases threatens what remains of the season.,“The good start (to 2022) is just papering over the cracks,” says John Dyer, who works at the Tourism Association in Furano, another well-known resort town in Hokkaido. “In reality, the past two seasons have been brutal.”,Several ski resorts have already gone into bankruptcy during the pandemic. Due to recent warm winters and the impacts of COVID-19, Mizuho Highland and Utopia Mountain Resort in Shimane Prefecture both went into administration, while the Mount Racey Ski Resort in Yubari, Hokkaido, filed for bankruptcy in January 2021.,“The Sanosaka Snow Resort, which is part of Hakuba Valley, stopped operations this winter after more than 40 years,” Fukushima says. “The resort’s business was already struggling before COVID-19, but the pandemic acted as a final trigger.”,
,
,Dave Enright, founder of Evergreen Outdoor Center, the largest English-language ski school in Hakuba, has similarly been affected by a drop in business.,“Pre-travel ban, 95% of our clients were foreigners,” Enright says. “We went from 250 full-time winter employees in 2019 to 25 in 2021, and generated only 10% of revenue compared to the previous year.”,Fukushima says the lack of visitors hurts local businesses as a whole.,“More than 70% of workers in Hakuba Village are engaged in the service industry, which means that they have all suffered tremendously due to the reduced numbers of tourists,” he says.,Some operators have given up on Japan for the 2022 season. Andrew Spragg, owner of Rising Sun Guides in Niseko, employed a team of 20 guides and staff prior to the pandemic, but has seen revenue drop by more than 90% since the introduction of the border control measures and has downsized to just three workers.,“I made the decision recently to go back and guide in Canada this winter,” Spragg says. “My wife and daughter will stay in Japan, but it made sense at this point for me to go somewhere where international tourism is allowed.”,
,
,The pandemic has highlighted the risk of resorts’ over-reliance on the winter season. Whether through fortune or foresight, the businesses that have been impacted least tend to be the ones with the most diversified operations.,“Although the potential of inbound tourism is enormous, it carries risk if businesses rely on it too much,” says Mikio Katagiri, who competed in two Winter Olympics for Japan and is now president of the Nozawa Onsen Snow Resort. “For about eight years, we have been strengthening our Japanese customer base in tandem with promoting international tourism. As a result, Nozawa has been less damaged than resorts that focus more on international visitors.”,The Hokkaido town of Higashikawa provides another example of how to create a more resilient tourism model.,“Although the number of people using the Asahidake ropeway — the closest ski area to Higashikawa — decreased by 50% in the 2020-21 season, we have not been overly affected,” says Kanako Wilcock, managing director of the Higashikawa Tourism Association. “Higashikawa does not rely exclusively on the winter sports industry, and therefore COVID-19 has had a lesser impact compared to other tourist destinations that depend on skiers coming from abroad.”,Similarly, the summer season in nearby Furano is a huge source of revenue that, coupled with a large and prosperous agricultural sector, has helped the town cope with the fall in international guests during winter.,“Furano is a rare ski resort because winter is almost considered to be low season,” Dyer says. “Pre-COVID, we received around 1 million visitors a year in the summer as opposed to around 400,000 in the winter, of which around a third were foreign visitors.”,Other resorts are also trying to adjust their business models. In response to the pandemic, the Hakuba Tourism Committee and numerous businesses — such as Evergreen Outdoor and Shirouma-so — are encouraging the independently run ski resorts of Hakuba Valley to collaborate and form an all-season and unified mountain resort as a way of spreading business throughout the valley instead of concentrating it in individual resorts.,
,
,Some sectors offer hope that business will recover swiftly once the pandemic has ended and border restrictions are eased.,The construction and real estate sectors in towns such as Niseko have remained relatively buoyant throughout the pandemic, as businesses and investors eye the long-term opportunities of the resort, with its growing reputation as the ski mecca of East Asia, its ambition to host the 2030 Sapporo Olympics and the planned extension of the Tohoku Shinkansen line that will connect Tokyo to Sapporo in just five hours, with a station slated to be built in Kutchan, just outside Niseko.,“Although we expect things to slow over the next two years, we foresee significant growth from 2024 onward,” says Libby Spears, sales manager on behalf of H2 Group, a Hokkaido-based luxury real estate and hospitality management company. “We are extremely confident about the strength of the market when borders reopen, largely due to pent-up demand for travel.”,The real estate sector in Furano has also experienced significant investments notwithstanding the travel ban.,“Real estate agents had a strong year in 2021, with investors buying land, houses and condos without even being able to visit them,” Dyer says.,And despite the fall in customers, the Niseko Hanazono Resort has just unveiled a new gondola and a heated chairlift for this year’s ski season, anticipating a return to regular business once tourism to Japan resumes.,In Nozawa Onsen, however, Katagiri is less confident of a quick return to pre-pandemic activity.,“The impact of the pandemic was enormous in the short term… and we believe that a cycle of another two to three years will be required for recovery,” Katagiri says.,
,
,Before the pandemic was declared in 2020, resorts across Japan were suffering from the worst year of snowfall since records began in 1961. Many resorts that were tipped into bankruptcy by the pandemic had already been struggling for years due to lower than expected snowfall and correspondingly short ski seasons.,“Climate change due to global warming can have fatal consequences for snow sports,” says Katagiri, who led Nozawa Onsen to purchase snow cannons to ensure a more reliable supply of snow throughout the season. “This is an extreme measure for an area that sees so much snowfall, but I think that this investment is something that’s absolutely necessary to counter the effects of climate change.”,With future upheaval likely, the pandemic appears to offer a clear lesson: Resorts with the most diversified offerings have the best chance of survival.,In Hakuba, the tourism committee and local businesses are working to promote nonwinter activities such as mountain biking, trekking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as making the valley a workation destination by boosting Wi-Fi access and creating free co-working spaces.,This approach has successfully transformed Hakuba Iwatake Mountain Resort, which now sees more customers in the summer than in the winter.,“We are more worried about global warming than COVID-19,” Fukushima says. “The mountains are not the same as they used to be.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,It has been over five decades since Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori developed a theory describing the eerie or uneasy feeling people experience in response to humanoid robots that closely, but not perfectly, resemble human beings.,Labeled the “uncanny valley” by Mori in 1970, the phenomenon has stood the test of time, with more recent examples of creepiness filtering into the burgeoning fields of artificial intelligence, photorealistic computer animation, virtual reality, augmented reality and increasingly lifelike androids.,
,But what happens beyond the other side of the valley as resemblance to humans is perfected? Some researchers worry that as “trusted” virtual humans become indistinguishable from real people, we open ourselves to more manipulation by platform providers. In other words, our responses while still in the uncanny valley, as creepy as they can be, could be a good thing — a kind of self-defense mechanism.,Mori, now 94 and a professor emeritus of the Tokyo Institute of Technology who retired in 1987, originally plotted his uncanny valley hypothesis on a graph, showing an observer’s emotional response against the human likeness of a robot.,He stated that as a robot’s appearance is made more human-like, there is a growing affinity for it, but only up to a point, beyond which the viewer experiences a reaction of extreme disgust, coldness, or even fear, shown by a plunge into the valley.,But as the robot becomes more indistinguishable from a real person, positive emotions of empathy similar to human-to-human interaction emerge once more. The disconcerting void between “not-quite-human” and “perfectly human” is the uncanny valley.,With tech companies led by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms Inc. staking a claim on the creation of a “metaverse” — viewed as the internet’s next iteration “where people can work and socialize in a virtual world” — some experts say the uncanny valley graph is just as pertinent in immersive environments, including in virtual reality and augmented reality.,While we have become accustomed to interacting with “low-fidelity versions of human faces going back to the early days of TV,” we will have the ability to project photorealistic humans in 3D virtual worlds before the end of this decade, said Louis Rosenberg, a 30-year veteran of AR development and CEO of Unanimous AI. How will we determine what is real?,“Personally, I believe the greatest danger of the metaverse is the prospect that agenda-driven artificial agents controlled by AI algorithms will engage us in ‘conversational manipulation’ without us realizing that the ‘person’ we are interacting with is not real.”,In a corporate-controlled metaverse featuring “virtual product placement,” we could easily think we are simply having a conversation with a person like ourselves, causing us to lower our defenses.,“You won’t know what was manipulated to serve the agenda of a paying third-party and what is authentic.”,This is dangerous because “the AI agent that is trying to influence us could have access to a vast database about our personal interests and beliefs, purchasing habits, temperament, etc. So how do we protect against this? Regulation,” Rosenberg said.,Mori himself has said designers should stop before the first peak of the uncanny valley and not “risk getting closer to the other side,” where robots — and now, by extension AI or AR — become indistinguishable from humans.,
,
,Applying his theory to the virtual world of the metaverse, he said, “If the person (in the real world) understands that the space they are in is imaginary, I do not think this presents a problem, even if it is creepy,” he said.,However, if the person is unable to distinguish reality from a virtual world, this itself will be a problem, he said, adding that the “bigger issue” is if bad actors misuse the technology for malicious purposes, comparing it to a sharp implement that can either be used “as a ‘dagger’ to kill or a ‘scalpel’ to save someone.”,In her research, Rachel McDonnell, an associate professor in Creative Technologies at the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin, poses the question, “Should we tread softly across the uncanny valley” with virtual humans?,She says while virtual humans have almost reached photorealism, “their conversational abilities are still far from a stage where they are convincing enough to be mistaken for a real human converser.”,A longtime proponent of making virtual humans more realistic, she says the biggest dangers now are “AI-driven video avatars or deepfake videos, where convincing videos can be created of one human, driven by the motion and speech of another.”,However, she adds, “Transparency around how avatars and videos are created will help overcome some of the ethical challenges around privacy and misrepresentation.” She gives an example of attaching a watermark to distinguish deepfakes from authentic video content.,Rosenberg, meanwhile, outlines various forms of regulation to keep the metaverse safe, such as informing users when they are engaging with a virtual persona.,“It could be that they are all required to dress a certain way, indicating they are not real, or have some other visual clue. But, an even more effective method would be to ensure that they actually don’t look quite human as compared to other users.”,That is, regulation could ensure virtual humans trigger the uncanny valley response deep within our brains, he said. “This is the most effective path because the response within us is visceral and subconscious, which would protect us most effectively from being fooled.”,Meta, the social media giant formerly known as Facebook that has rebranded to focus on the metaverse, has come under fire in recent years for spreading disinformation, mishandling users’ data and using algorithms that end up sowing discord and distrust on the internet, where users cling to their own “facts.”,On Dec. 9, Meta launched the cartoon-like Horizon Worlds to people 18 and older in the United States and Canada as Zuckerberg’s first attempt at his vision of an “embodied internet,” where avatars of real people will share a virtual space.,Christoph Bartneck, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, says that the metaverse, a name taken from the 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash” by Neal Stephenson, is not a new concept, and is, for now, merely fiction.,“It is a sign of a lack of originality that Facebook resorts to promise another virtual world. It seems like a gigantic distraction maneuver to take our attention away from all the bad influence that Facebook and its products have on society,” he said.,
,
,Last year, Meta announced it would spend at least $10 billion on its metaverse division to create AR and VR hardware, software, and content. Other tech companies, including Microsoft and video game and software developer Epic Games, have jumped on the bandwagon, while Nike Inc. has launched Nikeland, featuring virtual sneakers, on video-game platform Roblox.,Unanimous AI’s Rosenberg says making the metaverse seem “uncanny,” or not quite real, is easier than we think. “It turns out very small changes can make a big difference” by focusing on how our perception assigns authenticity to experiences.,Ameca, a humanoid robot from British design and manufacturing company Engineered Arts, is described as “the perfect platform to develop interaction between us humans and any metaverse or digital realm.” A recently unveiled AI robot with remarkably lifelike facial expressions, it appears astonished to be “awake” — perplexed and eerily amused.,“In the metaverse, the simplest thing — like how a virtual persona’s eyes move, or hair moves, or even just the speed of their motion (do they take longer to move than an actual human?) is enough to make them seem deeply unreal,” Rosenberg said, adding that regulation should require that artificial agents be distinguishable from others since this would be easy to achieve.,McDonnell, meanwhile, says she is still optimistic that realistic virtual humans will make a positive impact on society in a future metaverse, including benefits such as preserving users’ privacy in sensitive situations such as with whistleblowers or witnesses testifying in court and overcoming phobias, racial bias, and even conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.,“There is a huge potential for the use of virtual humans for good,” she said.,In experiments, her research team found that participants in survival tasks games “generally trusted” virtual agents who had suggested a ranking of objects vital for survival in hypothetical crash scenarios, “but small manipulations of the agents’ facial expressions or voice could influence the level of trust,” she said.,The notion of the uncanny valley as a defense mechanism dates back to Mori in 1970, who called it a “self-preservation instinct,” not from lifeless objects that appear different to us, but to protect us from things that are “exceedingly similar, such as corpses and related species,” Karl F. MacDorman, an associate professor in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, said.,As for Mori, who has said he never intended the uncanny valley to be a rigorous scientific theory but more a caveat for robotic designers, his message about the metaverse is simple.,“I hope (those) involved in creating it will make something healthy for the happiness of humanity,” Mori said.,

			,Contributing writer,When the PlayStation 5 launched in November 2020, obtaining the console seemed elusive. That’s how it always is. A new piece of hardware is released, hype ensues and the console becomes incredibly hard to get. Eventually, things settle down.,By July 2021, the PS5 , Sony’s fastest-selling console ever, reaching the 10 million sales mark quicker than the PS4. People were still buying Sony’s latest gaming machine in droves, and so getting one wasn’t easy.,
,This wasn’t my first rodeo, so to speak, as I’ve been buying game consoles for decades. To snag a new PlayStation on launch day in years past meant waiting overnight in front of an electronics store. More recently, I’ve started to shy away from such exhausting stunts, thinking that I can just wait until the consoles are readily available.,What’s more, the first batch of any hardware can be buggy with system errors, so it’s better to wait until any manufacturing kinks have been ironed out. At that time, I can just walk into a store and pick one up, avoiding waiting in long lines. As companies continue to make the devices, they become faster at churning them out. As an added bonus, by the time I’m ready to purchase a console, more games are released making sure that there’s definitely stuff to play. Shopping almost becomes a pleasant experience.,A year after its launch, that’s simply not the case for the PS5. I cannot easily walk into a store and purchase one. If I hope to secure one, I need to line up at a store or enter a lottery for a chance to buy one. If I want to buy a PS5 online, I’ll need to contend with bots before available stock appears to vanish in a flash. There simply aren’t enough of the devices to go around., reports that in the week before Christmas, less than 8,000 PS5 consoles were sold in Japan. In comparison, the No. 1 selling console that week, the Nintendo Switch, sold more than 46,000 units. The Switch doesn’t necessarily appear to be an easy console to snag, either.,This isn’t Sony’s fault. Semiconductor shortages meant getting a PS5 seemed more difficult than ever, even months after its release. The global supply chain has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns have led to factory and shipping disruptions.,Lockdowns have also meant that people have been spending more time at home, and the demand for devices has also increased. Couple all this with the factory that, only a handful of facilities are able to produce the necessary chips has, in turn, led to a global chip shortage, impacting everything from game consoles to cars.,According to ,, Sony had apparently hoped to produce more than 16 million PS5 consoles in the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31. With the global shortages impacting supply, Sony , it’s on track to sell 14.8 million units.,How much longer will this continue? It’s a tough question to answer.,“The supply of chips will remain very tight until at least September next year,” Takeshi Kamebuchi, a director in charge of semiconductors at Toshiba, told ,. In some instances, Kamebuchi added, this could continue until 2023.,Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has been less optimistic about things improving in the near term, , that the shortages will last until 2023 due to the time needed to increase capacity. I guess that means if I want a PS5 anytime soon, I had better get in line.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Love them or hate them, nonfungible tokens are making serious headway worldwide. According to a , report, sales of the crypto investment assets soared from just $13.7 million in the first six months of 2020 to a whopping $2.5 billion in the first half of last year. With Japanese game companies, in particular, beginning to embrace NFTs, 2022 could be the digital assets’ biggest year yet.,Primarily associated with images and video files, NFTs are data sets in a digital ledger that prove ownership. They’re not exactly new, with the first NFTs being launched in the mid-2010s. However, there is confusion over what NFTs represent, even among investors. They don’t necessary grant ownership or rights to physical pieces of work, most of which can still be freely disseminated online. People have reportedly paid as much as $69 million for a single NFT — and yet the same image can still be saved on a computer with a simple right click, free of charge. In their simplest form, NFTs are digital receipts and, ultimately, that’s what people are buying, not the work itself.,
,Still, there seems to be a market for NFTs, and some of Japan’s biggest game companies are eager to cater to it. In a ,, Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda referred to 2021 as “Year One” of NFTs and, without going into specifics, showed support for the technology, writing that he looked forward to when digital goods were “as familiar as dealings in physical goods.”,Square Enix has already entered the fray by creating NFTs for its Million Arthur franchise. In Square Enix’s financial meeting in autumn, the company , this initial entry was “a proof of concept for establishing what synergies we can derive by combining NFTs with our business assets,” adding that “NFTs have a high affinity with our assets.”,
,
,Square Enix isn’t the only Japanese game giant keen on NFTs, with Sega also ,. However, Chief Executive Officer Haruki Satomi , that the digital assets have evoked negative reactions and added that he was against a mere money-making opportunity.,That’s because if you want to make some quick cash, it can seem like NFTs are the way to go. In January 2021, for example, entertainment conglomerate Konami held an , to mark Castlevania’s 35th anniversary, featuring game scenes, background music and art. The 14 NFTs Konami auctioned off netted more than $160,000.,Interestingly, Konami’s official NFT site made it clear that the purchasers didn’t obtain copyrights or trademark rights by buying the NFTs. What’s more, the Tokyo-based game maker clearly stated that “Konami does not guarantee that the value of the NFT will increase after the purchase.”,It’s also worth noting that not all video game NFTs are necessarily doing well. In late 2021, Ubisoft introduced NFTs of in-game gear for Ghost Recon Breakpoint that players could earn (one NFT required 600 hours’ worth of playing time) in the hope that players would resell them through an authorized vendor. The launch was reportedly a ,.,Other developers have pushed back against the notion of including NFTs in their games, and Steam outright ,. Even Microsoft seemed skittish about them, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer telling ,, “What I’d say today on NFT, all up, is I think there’s a lot of speculation and experimentation that’s happening, and that some of the creative that I see today feels more exploitive than about entertainment.” Spencer isn’t totally against NFTs full stop, but is wary of their current incarnation.,

What’s more, some simply don’t like the concept of NFTs, in which you’re not buying the actual digital work or its copyright or trademark, but, rather, just a receipt that confirms you own it.,For gamers, in particular, the past few years have seen an increase of in-game monetization, where that’s been for new downloadable gaming content, characters or in-game items. There has been a real-money trade for rare in-game items, and people have shelled out good money for leveled up characters.,In such cases, however, it feels like this is more akin to financial speculation, with game companies trying to turn a quick profit instead of investing their time and energy in making their games more enjoyable.,That said, it’s still early in the lifespan of the NFT, and the asset will have to grow beyond its current incarnation if it is going to win over any naysayers.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,One of the most important Japanese entertainers of the 21st century is calling it a day, and she isn’t even technically real.,Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI will go on “indefinite hiatus” following one last, livestreamed concert tonight at 7 p.m. Thousands of viewers are expected to log on to watch the digital character, sporting her trademark pink bow, perform a set of upbeat pop songs. It’s their last chance to spend time with a creator who, over five years, delivered a new kind of online content geared toward digital natives.,
,Kizuna AI, created by entertainment company , and voiced by actress Nozomi Kasuga, pioneered the art of VTubing. This corner of online content — defined as any creator using an avatar to represent themselves on screen — has been growing rapidly in popularity. A 2020 trends report from YouTube , that VTuber videos received 1.5 billion views per month, while virtual idols in China alone ,, with a massive growth forecast in that market alone.,All of this financial and soft power success began with Kizuna AI, who came up ,. So when she announced in December 2021 that she intended to “,,” many netizens were stunned.,“I’m not that rare anymore,” she said with a melancholic giggle. Like any real-life trailblazer whose creation has morphed into something no longer recognizable to them, Kizuna AI must have realized her time was up.,Virtual entertainers have existed for decades. Depending on how much you are willing to stretch the definition, they’ve been around since Alvin and the Chipmunks were ,. Japan has attempted to create multiple virtual pop stars, starting with the ultimately doomed , about 25 years ago. While the character Hatsune Miku achieved success, she is an entirely different force, serving more as a conduit for user creativity than as a traditional superstar in control of their output. The closest true predecessors to modern VTubers are the creator , and virtual weather forecaster ,.,On the other hand, the team behind Kizuna AI designed her in accordance with the signifiers of the typical Japanese idol or entertainment personality, which included fan service in the vein of music act AKB48’s daily concerts and meet-and-greet events — but this virtual version would connect instead by updating her YouTube channel frequently, taking part in social media challenges and collaborating with other creators.,Looking back on her videos, it’s surprising how mundane Kizuna AI’s content could be, given the possibilities of the character. She ,, , and ,, all relatively simple activities. However, this was the key to her success — keeping things light and accessible, while emphasizing her unique cartoon look. While she eventually branched out into a ,, Kizuna AI never strayed far from the YouTuber model.,The character’s success inspired new virtual creators here and abroad, and an entire industry sprung up trying to capitalize on the VTuber boom. ,, , and , are just a few of the companies that emerged, taking the concept of producing short, engaging videos and placing it in one of the oldest entertainment frameworks — the , (talent agency). Eventually, the expansion caused VTubers to drastically change the way they presented content to allow for fan engagement in real time. Whereas Kizuna AI uploaded relatively short prerecorded videos, current VTuber heavyweight , shares livestreams that go on for hours. It has become even more intimate, to the point where,.,Still, Kizuna AI’s influence looms large.

			,BLOOMBERG,Arcadia Kim devoted her career to video games, until one hit her in the face. The incident happened several years ago when Kim, a former studio operating chief at Electronic Arts Inc., was trying to peel away her then 10-year-old son from a game of Minecraft. He threw the iPad at her in frustration.,Kim, 48, said the experience inspired her to start a business in 2019 advising parents on forming healthy relationships between their kids and their screens. The work took on greater urgency this year when the World Health Organization began formally recognizing video game addiction as an illness for the first time.,
,Among gamers and parents and even within the medical community, there’s disagreement about whether gaming addiction is real. Either way, the WHO’s designation could provide a boon to Kim and other businesses like hers. Dozens of consultants operate in the U.S. alone, as well as an assortment of apps, camps, self-help books and treatment centers.,A diagnosis of addiction is based on a series of symptoms, according to the WHO. They include a lack of control over the impulse to play video games, a tendency to prioritize it at the expense of other interests or obligations and continued or escalated involvement despite experiencing negative consequences.,Studies offer varying conclusions, in part due to disagreements over how to define addiction, but they typically show the illness in 2% to 3% of people who play games. A similar condition called gaming disorder is more prevalent in the population than compulsive gambling but less than compulsive shopping, estimated Matthew Stevens of the University of Adelaide in Australia.,
,
,Achieving recognition was a years-long process. WHO member states voted in 2018 to add it to the organization’s disease classification list, which helps standardize health reporting and tracking worldwide. The change didn’t go into effect until last month, a lag designed to give the health care industry time to prepare.,Yet, the debate rages on among behavioral scientists. Some therapists argue the American Psychiatric Association should follow the WHO and acknowledge gaming addiction. The effort would require proposals and academic papers.,The last time the association classified a new addiction was in 2013, when it added gambling, said Paul Appelbaum, chair of the APA committee in charge of making such designations. Changes come slowly and “really need to be backed up by data if they’re going to be widely accepted,” he said.,A broad recognition of the disorder would have legal ramifications.,“It would make it more difficult for courts to exclude experts who testify on video gaming addiction,” said Matt Bergman, an Oregon lawyer who has filed lawsuits against social media companies on behalf of teenagers.,In Kim’s line of work, she often deals with people who overindulge in games, but she’s reluctant to use the word addiction. “It has a very specific meaning,” said Kim, who advises parents through her consultancy Infinite Screentime. “Let’s not turn it into something it’s not.”,Before her son hit her in the face with an iPad, Kim spent almost a decade at Electronic Arts, the publisher of Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden. She was COO of the Los Angeles studio, where she helped publish a Lord of the Rings game, oversaw development of the war games Medal of Honor Airborne and Command and Conquer 3 and worked on the Sims 2. She’s proud of her time there.,But there are aspects of Kim’s work that she still contemplates to this day. She compares part of her job to a novelist crafting a suspenseful plot or a television writer creating a cliffhanger for the end of an episode. The goal was to ensure the games were hard to put down.,“The more I was able to hook people, bring them into the world, bring something people could escape to-the better I was at that, the more successful I was at my job,” she said.,EA said it offers various parental control options to facilitate healthy habits for kids and ran an ad campaign in the U.K. to raise awareness of these tools.,“Game play must be balanced with responsible play, and we take seriously our role in ensuring parents are empowered and aware of all the resources available to help them make the right decisions for their families,” Chris Bruzzo, the company’s chief experience officer, said in an emailed statement.,Developers at EA also spent considerable amounts of time strengthening what’s known as the compulsion loop, Kim said. Fine-tuning certain techniques can help draw players back, using such tools as a point system, character upgrades, extra lives and ample surprises. Many of the principles were laid out in a 2001 essay, Behavioral Game Design, by one of the industry’s most renowned researchers, John Hopson, whose credits include Microsoft Corp.’s Halo 3.,
,
,Kim left Los Angeles in 2006 for South Korea and consulted for an EA studio there for two years. She now lives in Hong Kong.,The iPad incident took place on a trip back to LA in 2017. The family was staying with Kim’s brother, Bernard Kim, the president of Zynga Inc., itself the creator of many enthralling games such as FarmVille. (He said he supports his sister’s work.) Kim had rounded up her two young daughters for an outing but couldn’t find her son. She suspected he was in active violation of the family rule limiting daily screen time to 20 minutes. Then she discovered him in a guest bedroom, a screen’s glow gently illuminating the covers he was hiding under. The ensuing outburst left her in tears, face stinging, slumped on the floor of a nearby bathroom.,Kim concluded that her limits were unreasonably tight, borne out of a sense of guilt about her prior professional work on games and fear over their power. She was unintentionally creating an association of shame with her son’s interest in the medium. Now Kim tries to embrace her children’s hobby.,“My son gets so excited when he talks about his Minecraft world,” she said.,For clients of Infinite Screentime, Kim advises parents to play video games with their children and encourages kids to decide how long a game session should last before it starts and plan for intermissions.,Kim also tells clients about the compulsion loop and how to recognize the hooks. People dislike being manipulated, she said, and simple awareness of the strategy helps control the impulse to overdo it.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,On Jan. 18, tech giant Microsoft , plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. for $68.7 billion in a deal that would include smash-hit franchises such as Call of Duty, Warcraft and Candy Crush.,Later that same month, Sony , game studio Bungie, creators of first-person shooter Overwatch and the original studio behind Halo, in a deal worth $3.6 billion.,
,Both acquisitions are significant in their own way, but some in the industry are now wondering where such expansionist moves leave Japanese rival Nintendo?,Founded in 1889, Nintendo is a relatively new enterprise compared to other businesses in Kyoto, where it is based. In the world of video games, however, it is the industry’s oldest and most storied company.,The company initially cut its teeth on producing playing cards, but had already started to produce arcade games by the 1970s. Around the same time as Atari tanked in the United States with the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom console in Japan and video games were never the same again.,Throughout its history, Nintendo has always done things its own way. At its best, the company bucks trends and seeks to create an appetite for a product that’s completely new.,It’s perhaps not surprising than that while the other console makers are looking to unload dump trucks worth of cash on new acquisitions, Nintendo appears to be more sanguine. According to a , report in early February, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa appears to be circumspect about acquisitions, saying, “It wouldn’t be a plus to suddenly bring in people who don’t have Nintendo’s way of thinking.”,Nintendo isn’t against acquiring studios per se, as can be seen in its acquisition of Monolith Software, creators of Xenosaga, from Bandai Namco in 2007.,However, the acquisition wasn’t just some random purchase, as the two parties had been working together for some time.,Speaking at the time of the purchase, Satoru Iwata, then-president of Nintendo, ,.,“When we say we do not do M&A, there are always exceptions, so let me explain,” he said. “We have never said that we will never do M&A in any situation.”,Iwata noted that Nintendo would consider an acquisition if it could “absorb the real value of the company.”,Before the acquisition, Monolith Software had been in a long relationship with Nintendo and made games that suited its hardware.,“If certain conditions are met, we may do the same thing in the future,” Iwata said. “However, we will be very careful and selective, so that we will only partner with people with whom Nintendo can create a long-term working relationship.”,Corporate culture for Nintendo is key, as are relationships. In this regard, Nintendo doesn’t see business as a way to produce short-term profit. Nintendo could snap up studios and slap the company’s logo on games, but it sets a high bar for creativity and quality. Ultimately, Nintendo takes time to ensure the games it produces with its new partners are airtight.,In late February, Nintendo made an acquisition of its own, purchasing longtime programming specialist Systems Research and Development. Nintendo’s relationship with SRD stretches back four decades, with the programmer even being involved in making the original Super Mario Bros game.,In an official statement, the Kyoto-based gaming giant said the move “will serve to strengthen the management base of SRD and secure the availability of software development resources for Nintendo” as well as to help serve as “an anticipated improvement in software development efficiency.”,For Nintendo, it’s a move that carries little risk as it has been working with SRD since 1983. Such partnerships are an effective way for Nintendo to maintain its quality by making sure its studios — and the people working in them — continue to produce content at the same lofty standards as they have been over the years.,Nintendo won’t risk of ruining what makes Nintendo, well, Nintendo. That’s far too special.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bloomberg,When Facebook hosted an internal competition a few years ago to develop new product ideas, a handful of employees teamed up to build a robot named Max.,Shaped like a small, upside-down bowl, Max was designed to be a companion–a physical device humans could talk to that could detect their mood, according to two people familiar with the hackathon project. The creators gave Max little ears and whiskers so the device would be more fun and approachable, like a cat.,
,Max never evolved beyond the hackathon. But engineers and researchers at the company, now called Meta Platforms Inc., are still grappling with the thorny problem the experimental robot cat was designed to combat: loneliness. Meta, with a mission to help people connect online, has discovered through internal research that its products can just as easily have an isolating effect. As the company struggles to retain and add users for its already-massive social networks, making sure those people are happy is key to Meta’s financial success.,Loneliness has come into sharper focus at Meta during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people use its social media apps as alternatives to in-person experiences. Meta has promoted its role as a digital connector, running ads touting its groups and messaging products. “We change the game when we find each other,” reads a tagline for one of its recent commercials. But internally, employees are questioning their products’ impact on mental health.,Meta wants to address the problem but doesn’t know how. Internal research shows that a given feature — such as one that shows people photo memories — can spark feelings of connection for some and sadness for others. Regulators, meanwhile, are already probing whether Meta’s Instagram harms young people.,An internal study from September 2018 found that more than a third of Facebook users — approximately 36% — reported feeling lonely in the past month, according to documents disclosed by Frances Haugen, a former product manager. Haugen, responsible for leaking a large cache of internal documents, was selected by the Joe Biden administration to attend the State of the Union address, where the president underscored the need to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.” The study, based on in-depth interviews with 53 people, found loneliness was most common with young people, age 13 to 24, a key demographic that Meta is targeting for both Facebook and Instagram. Loneliness was also more common with men than women.,Internal researchers acknowledged that Meta’s social networks could be exacerbating loneliness instead of alleviating it. Another study from November 2018, also in Haugen’s cache of documents, found that certain Facebook experiences increase loneliness — like seeing “negative posts or hurtful comments,” seeing friends having fun without you or seeing posts that lead to social comparisons. Facebook use made people feel “less lonely” than some other activities, like using Twitter or dating apps. But people also said using Facebook increased loneliness more than other activities its researchers surveyed, including video games and TV.,Other experiences reduced loneliness, like “seeing something funny or entertaining,” the research found. One key data point relates to how much time users spent on the service, the report found. “People who spend about an hour a day are the least lonely,” it says. “People who spend much less or much more time are lonelier.” When users who are already lonely turn to Facebook, 41% said it made them feel better, and just 6% said it made them feel worse. But 42% said they felt both more and less lonely after using the app.,The conflicting results make it difficult to prescribe what kinds of product changes could benefit Facebook’s users. And the stakes are high: On Feb. 2, Facebook reported that its user base stopped growing, and shrank in some markets, for the first time. The company’s shares lost more than a quarter of their value the next day.,Continuing to understand loneliness is key to the company’s goals, says Eden Litt, a director on Meta’s internal research team.,“There tends to be a relationship between social media and loneliness” in some research, Litt says, “but those studies can’t answer for us: Is social media causing loneliness? Are lonely people coming to social media?” Users’ life experiences, such as big moves or romantic breakups, may affect the data, she added.,The stakes of loneliness extend far beyond fleeting moments of discomfort, according to a growing body of academic research. Feeling socially disconnected from others is linked to physical and emotional problems such as heart disease, Alzheimer’s, depression and anxiety. Lonely people are also more likely to get less sleep, exercise less and consume more alcohol, says Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University.,“We’re not meant to be alone,” Holt-Lunstad says. “Our brains use more metabolic resources when facing threats alone versus when we’re in the presence of others.” Whether or not it’s responsible for such feelings, Meta has a business incentive to solve the problem of loneliness. The more social media connections someone has, and the more fulfilling those connections are, the more likely people will find value in using Meta’s products.,At the start of the pandemic, when Meta saw people logging into its apps more often, the company pushed aggressively into video and voice calling features to compete with Apple Inc.’s FaceTime and Zoom Video Communications Inc. New Facebook video products, like Rooms, were created to keep Facebook users connected, but also offered the company a chance to capture an even greater segment of users’ time spent online.,Facebook Groups has been another popular way to promote more intimate interactions. More than 1.8 billion people use Facebook Groups each month, making it one of the company’s most popular features. But Groups have also become an incubator for many of Meta’s biggest problems, like misinformation and extremism. The company has also experimented over the years with dating and location products that encourage friends to meet up offline, though without much success.,In an experience akin to having a robot cat, users of Meta’s WhatsApp can now message an automated chat account. If someone tells the bot they’re lonely, they are sent a comforting response. “We’re so sorry to hear that you are feeling lonely,” the bot says. “Please know that there is no shame or stigma in feeling lonely — nearly everyone has experienced loneliness at some point in their lives.” The chatbot was created after WhatsApp approached the U.K.-based Jo Cox Foundation for help, according to Su Moore, the head of the organization. The bot includes messages from public figures in the U.K., who all share personal experiences of social isolation.,Ultimately, Meta’s research reports concluded that Facebook is a “net positive” when it comes to loneliness. Still, they note that the tendency of its products to encourage social comparison can “drive people to use Facebook in ways that aggravate loneliness.” The researchers recommended letting users set time limits for how much they use the service.,Employees also found that “funny, inspirational and instructive content” helps reduce loneliness. The internal report recommended the company “up rank” those types of posts in user feeds. The recommendation came with a warning, though, that Facebook should “be careful not to over-pivot to ‘junk food’ that makes people feel happy in the short term.” Facebook’s memories product, which shows users old photos and videos, increased loneliness for 40% of respondents, the company found. But it also decreased loneliness for 46% of respondents.,Litt says the company has continued to study loneliness throughout the pandemic, though a spokesperson declined to share updated research from the past two years.,Some outside researchers agree with Facebook’s 2018 finding that an hour a day on social media represents healthy use. Young people who log in for that time range “seem to have the highest levels of well-being and connectedness and are less lonely,” scoring higher on wellness measures than people who use social media much more or not at all, says Melissa Hunt, associate director of the clinical training department of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.,Meta has faced intense scrutiny in recent months from regulators and advocates who argue the company gets vulnerable users hooked on its products while spoon-feeding them content that hurts their mental health. For others, those same social networks are a lifeline away from social isolation.,Meta may end up relying on its users to build communities people want to join. Instagram has increased its investment in creators and influencers on its app, who can build a sense of belonging around certain interests or talents. And then there are people like Sue Ottey.,Ottey, 58, is the kind of user Meta would feature in an ad. She started a Facebook support group for people like her who are feeling alone during the pandemic. In the group, which now has more than 250 members, users share their feelings about grappling with job losses or emotionally unsatisfying intimate relationships.,“If they’re dealing with loneliness, they are not putting themselves in social situations where they can vent, where they can express their feelings,” Ottey says. “All of those things just will drive you to a really dark place, if you don’t nip it in the bud, and that’s what I’m hoping to do.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,There was a moment, about six years ago, when Nigo realized he felt old.,This is not a particularly unusual feeling for someone in his mid-40s, as he was then. But this was Nigo, one of the most influential figures in street wear, who helped turn a subculture into culture-culture, who practically pioneered the concept of selling $400 hoodies to lines of hungry, hungry hypebeasts.,
,Nigo (whose real name is Tomoaki Nagao) had been tapping into youth culture since 1993, when he founded A Bathing Ape (or Bape). Often seen wearing Bape’s signature camouflage pattern, along with diamond-encrusted necklaces, the mononymous designer and music producer had become a cool guys’ cool guy, a hero-collaborator to men such as Pharrell Williams, Kanye West and Virgil Abloh.,But as he approached middle age, Nigo found himself dressing more conservatively, he says. After 20 years with Bape, he had sold and left the brand, focusing instead on his other labels (such as Human Made, founded in 2010) and other roles (such as creative director of the Uniqlo UT collection, appointed in 2014). He began to think, “Maybe it’s not my time anymore,” as he recalls in an interview, speaking through a Japanese translator.,Then Williams intervened.,“I was like, ‘What are you doing?’” says Williams, a longtime friend and business partner through their Billionaire Boys Club label. “Now is not the time for that. Now is the time for you to really hunker down, put your head down low and do what you do best. You are one of the greatest curators of taste and purveyors of what’s next.”,(“Everything was just changing really rapidly,” Williams says of Nigo’s quasi-midlife crisis. “And Nigo’s a Capricorn. Capricorn’s an earth sign, so they’re into certainty.”),Nigo took the advice seriously, realizing it was part of his job, he says, to not “succumb to those kinds of tendencies” of feeling old or out of touch.,Now, a few years removed from his intervention, Williams sees this moment in Nigo’s life as necessary, “so that he could make room for this” — this being Nigo’s newest role as artistic director of Kenzo. On Sunday in Paris, the 51-year-old designer presented his first collection for the brand, which is owned by LVMH.,When the announcement of Nigo’s appointment was made in September, it emphasized that he was the first Japanese designer of the house since Kenzo Takada, its founder. Takada left the brand in 1999, a few years after selling to LVMH for about $80 million. He died in 2020 at age 81 of complications from COVID-19.,Nigo never met Takada, he says, although Takada had occasionally visited the campus of Nigo’s alma mater, Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo, while Nigo was a student. Still, Kenzo’s early work was a big influence on Nigo as a teenager.,The brand “had a particularly interesting way of using powerful colors together,” Nigo says, which differed from the dark, somber, cool use of color dominating Japanese fashion at the time. Takada’s collections highlighted Asian textiles but also borrowed elements from European folk dress, theater costumes, military uniforms and more.,This absorption of eclectic influences is something Nigo sees reflected in his own work. He has long been inspired by (and has inspired) hip-hop culture. His work incorporates military themes, cartoonish animal illustrations and vintage American workwear silhouettes. Yet his first Kenzo collection was largely an homage to Takada’s early work, particularly his designs from the 1980s.,Those early collections included accents such as kimono sleeves and oversize berets; the new Kenzo kimonos are imagined as overcoats, and its large berets are embroidered with the year “1970.” (That’s the year Nigo was born, but also the year Takada presented his first fashion show at Galerie Vivienne, which is the site of Nigo’s Sunday show.),There are some tiger graphics in the new collection — a Kenzo motif that was commercially successful under Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, Kenzo’s creative directors from 2011-19 — but for the most part, Nigo’s Kenzo is exceptionally floral, incorporating poppies, cherry blossoms and other botanical prints that are new, old or redrawn from archival patterns.,A paisley-print shirt from the archive becomes a vibrant green shirtdress. A two-tone Harris tweed jacket — gray and dark gray in Takada’s archive — is newly rendered in yassified pink and dark gray. A white men’s suit is covered in original fashion sketches by Takada. Denim, an obsession of Nigo’s, is tailored like formalwear.,There is very little skin or sex appeal, although that was never really the point of Kenzo. Nigo presented both menswear and womenswear Sunday, although both collections come across as fairly unisex. (This is the first time he has overseen a women’s collection.),He has referred to his new job as “the greatest challenge of my 30-year career” (in September’s announcement) and “huge pressure” (in his interview for this article), but Nigo says he accepted the position almost immediately. He was first approached in 2020, after the release of his first Louis Vuitton collaboration with Virgil Abloh, the late men’s designer who considered Nigo a mentor.,To the fashion industry, Nigo’s appointment signaled just how important street wear has become to luxury houses.,“When we met Nigo, he was already known as a pioneer of today’s new culture, going even beyond fashion,” says Sidney Toledano, chair and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group.,But how much hypebeast culture will be coming to Kenzo along with Nigo? There will be a focus on creating a sense of exclusivity, the house has said, including through limited-edition drops, but Nigo is adamant that it’s “not really just about kind of limiting the number of items.”,“That sort of just seems like a kind of a trick,” he says. “It’s more about concentrating on making things desired. More of a focus on taking care of how each single is presented and sold to the audience.”,Similarly, although Nigo is widely associated with collaborations — with Levi’s, with Adidas, with KAWS, with Kentucky Fried Chicken — they won’t be his focus at Kenzo for now.,“The focus is to make the Kenzo brand intrinsically exciting,” he says. “We’re always open to doing interesting collaborations, but they’re just spice. They’re not the meal.”,The hope seems to be that Nigo’s inherent coolness — and proximity to coolness — will drive the brand in that direction, rather than any specific overhauls to the business model. Because Nigo is — by all accounts, and despite his moment of doubt six years ago — still cool.,“Anyone that’s doing anything cool, they’ve been influenced by Nigo,” says Steven Victor, whose Victor Victor Worldwide imprint at Universal Music Group is releasing Nigo’s new album on March 25.,It’s the first Nigo has released under his name in nearly 20 years, and it will feature Williams, ASAP Rocky, Lil Uzi Vert, Pusha T and Tyler, the Creator.,But ask Nigo why he is doing an album now, after all these years, and he’ll bring it all back to Kenzo Takada.,“There’s a very famous quote from Kenzo-san,” Nigo says. “When he was asked, ‘What’s fashion?’ he replied: ‘Music.’”,

			,Contributing writer,Everyone reporting on the arts scene in the context of the pandemic is duty bound to speak in hushed tones to acknowledge that the current situation has forced countless closures and deterred young creatives from embarking on a career in something they are passionate about.,Still, despite the gloom, the retail reality at the country’s leading department stores has actually been quite positive of late, with early sales figures from the clearance sales at the start of the new year putting the likes of Sogo & Seibu Co. and Takashimaya Co. on a 150% increase in earnings year on year. Even Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, which did better than most to weather the storm last year, posted a 130% increase in earnings year on year.,
,It is interesting to look at what consumers are buying. Compared to last year, stores have observed that visitors are stocking up on white shirts and suits now that many are back in the office, with overall fashion sales up on the whole.,Naturally, the department stores have yet to return to pre-COVID figures, with clearance sales earnings at all three chains trading at 20-30% less than they were in early 2020.,However, it’s still a pretty good result given the lack of the inbound duty-free shoppers and, while there is a long way to go, recovery doesn’t look to be completely out of reach when more than 6,500 people lined up to get into the Isetan Shinjuku department store in Tokyo on Jan. 2.,Collectibles appear to be center of attention in fashion circles these days, with investors steering clear of bulky, delicate streetwear items that generally fall in value over time.,
,
,Enter the world of nonfungible tokens and their ability to put a price on just about everything. While NFT fashion collaborations are now so de rigueur they barely warrant attention, creatives are still fumbling around trying to find a sense of value beyond the monetary.,In the absence of being able to assemble a large collection of physical items, the idea of digitally collecting fashion appears very attractive. But given that fashion is a transitory medium of evolving trends, shoppers seem largely unmoved by the idea of buying an NFT of a jacket they are going to replace next season. The projects that tend to succeed are those that embrace that transitory nature, allowing people to own a point in fashion history — not fashion present.,Take, for instance, the auction earlier this month of seven NFT that are related to the inaugural issue of Fruits magazine, published in 1997. The NFT items are scans of the uncropped original photos that would be used in the magazine — iconic pieces of Harajuku fashion captured by street fashion photographer Shoichi Aoki.,The clothes worn by the subjects themselves are likely worthless, but as a nostalgic snapshot of those on the ground in Harajuku in the 1990s, or those who discovered them abroad through Phaidon’s “FRUiTS” 2001 compilation book, they clearly have a personal value further validated by the financial value. The seven NFT fetched 3.65 ETH (around ¥1. 4 million, or roughly ¥200,000 each) and are now circulating on the market.,You can still find physical copies of the magazine’s inaugural edition for much less than that, or just be a wag and download the image file, but that is missing the point of what is going on here.,Fashion suffers from severe “buyers’ regret” at times, with people looking back and laughing at the clothes they used to wear that meant the world to them at the time. Being able to see a satisfying monetary value sitting next to your memories is a shortcut to a sense of fulfillment.,
,
,This is only the start of a digital metaverse project that will probably prove baffling and exhausting to people who only just found out what an NFT is. In short, through a Fruits collaboration with Harajuku-based Asobi System, Paradeall and Fracton Ventures, a virtual Tokyo has been created on the new , platform. To buy in, you will need a pass that is purchased as an NFT, and that then gets you access to member-only content and events on the platform. The current price is 0.05 ETH (just shy of ¥20,000) on the OpenSea platform.,The cost of entry is largely insignificant compared to technology literacy required to access this virtual world, but the prospect of being able to walk through the streets of late ’90s Harajuku is sure to encourage some to get involved.,Of course, there is a lot of cynicism that surrounds these kinds of projects, especially given the sums of money that can be involved with NFT, the ecological impact of the blockchain model, and the risk of the servers that host the NFT and related projects being discontinued.,However, there is some sense of need being answered here, and, even if it doesn’t last, it will ultimately become another part of fashion history.,MetaTokyo: https://metatokyo.xyz,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,When Shizuko Kuroha learned in June 2021 that the Tokyo International Great Quilt Festival was canceled due to the pandemic, she knew she had to do something.,Held annually for 19 years, the event used to fill Tokyo Dome for six days with quilters from around the world as well as vendors, dealers and workshops accompanied by organized tours to local and regional quilters, dyers and textile makers. After Kuroha conferred with a group of fellow quilters, they formed the , and decided to hold their own event — the Tokyo Quilt Show — in March 2022 despite having little more than a few months to put it all together.,
,“A lot of quilters felt saved by making quilts during the pandemic,” says Kuroha, a master quilter and president of the Japan Quilt Society Board. “We wanted to provide a place to show their work and deepen the bond among quilters.”,Kuroha estimates Japan’s quilting community numbers around 2.5 million, with many regularly taking top spots in international competitions for their artistry and craftsmanship.,Mutsuko Yawatagaki is one of those quilters with new work to showcase. As the founder of the , in Shimane Prefecture, Japan’s only museum devoted to quilting, Yawatagaki recently designed a new quilt celebrating the Oyama pilgrimage.,A nearly 70-kilometer walk from Tokyo to the peak of Mount Oyama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Yawatagaki’s quilt depicts the pilgrimage while honoring the sacred mountain and those who make the annual trek. Popularized in the Edo Period (1603-1868) by shopkeepers and craftsmen, particularly carpenters and steeplejacks who could see the mountain as they worked on the rooftops of the ancient capital, Mount Oyama appealed for the relative ease of getting there. Its close proximity to the city meant it was only a few days walk and, because it was officially declared a “local trip,” no special permits were required for travel.,
,
,The Oyama pilgrimage also became a favorite subject for kabuki plays and ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the time, which only served to further fuel interest in it as a destination.,At its peak of popularity, nearly 200,000 pilgrims donned the signature white cotton , (pilgrim coat) to make the journey each summer, almost one-fifth of Edo’s population. Even though numbers have dwindled over the years, the pilgrimage remains a vibrant part of life on the mountain.,It was those pilgrim coats that inspired Yawatagaki’s project. As pilgrim groups disbanded or dissolved, their jackets remained at the inns where they stayed during their annual visit. Donated for this project and with the groups’ permission by the late Takeshi Satoh, pilgrimage guide and owner of Oosumi Sansou, one of many pilgrim inns on Mount Oyama, they were something new for Yawatagaki.,“Normally, I work with kimono silk, and often old kimono silk,” Yawatagaki says. “I hadn’t worked with cotton for a long time, but I was very taken with the different whites and the various designs. I’d never seen or touched a pilgrim coat for myself before. They had an air of Edo about them that was very unique.”,Yawatagaki knew immediately that the coats would play a starring role as the mountain itself. The challenge was to work with the slightly different shades of white or off-white of coats that heralded from the late 19th to 20th centuries and their unique designs.,Many pilgrims have been coming to Mount Oyama for hundreds of years, and groups often commission a specific design for the kanji characters that make up their names. Hence, the designs emblazoned across the back of the jackets varied from simple black or blue lettering to complex patterns and stylized kanji characters in combinations of colors.,For Yawatagaki, there was tale upon tale there, and each jacket needed to be able to find its own voice while blending with the others to make the whole.,“All of my quilts have a story,” she says, “but in this work, it was especially important to keep the personality of the coats alive. They are the center of the story.”,
,
,Yet, how to tell this particular story well while giving all of these elements as much emphasis as possible proved difficult with her initial plan of cutting them into squares. When she hit on the idea of shaping the pieces made from the coats like a mountain, the puzzle came together.,Rising up from the surrounding landscape as the central image is Mount Oyama made of the coats with the symbols for each group prominently displayed and the topmost one sharing the name of the mountain.,At its feet, the forests and rivers that the pilgrims would have passed through on foot en route from Edo, are represented with a rich array of greens, grays, blues and browns made from antique kimono silk from the 18th and 19th centuries. These are cut in traditional Japanese patterns of , (hemp leaf), , (checks), , (tortoise shell) and , (diamonds).,The sky over Mount Oyama consists of more grays and browns along with blues and blacks in solid and patterned pieces cut into , (a variation on the seven treasures motif) and a variation on the , (arrow) motif. Each shape represents natural and sacred elements that recur in traditional Japanese textiles and crafts that also made them perfect for this portrait of the pilgrimage and its mountain.,Underscoring each of the pieces and their materials is the hand stitching that binds it all together. Close examination reveals a repetition of asanoha, ichimatsu, and kikkō but also intersecting circles that seem to rise up from within the pilgrim coats.,“The section done in the asanoha motif represents the pine trees on the mountain but also provides a sense of growth and of life,” Yawatagaki says. “The circles suggest the spirit that embodies this place and these coats. Each stitch was made with a sense of prayer that all would go well for everyone.”,There is, of course, one more character present. Just over Mount Oyama’s right shoulder stands Mount Fuji, depicted in strips of white, gray and purple silk. For this, Yawatagaki took inspiration from the ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the period where the two mountains are often seen together.,The quilt also has the blessing of Oyama Afuri Shrine, which is planning to exhibit it later this year.,“Not being familiar with quilting, I wasn’t sure what to expect,” says Kunihiko Meguro, a priest at Oyama Afuri Shrine. “But the quilt came out beautifully. I’m sure that seeing it will inspire people to want to know more about our unique history.”,
,
,Quilting is often associated with Europe and North America, but seeds of the idea were first planted in Japan in the 1950s by American missionaries, military wives and wives of businessmen who taught Japanese women some of the techniques.,The craft truly took root in Japan when “Little House on the Prairie,” the 1970s American television series about a pioneer family and based on the Laura Ingalls Wilder books, aired. Budding quilters recorded the show and paused on the scenes of Ingalls working on her quilts in order to study her techniques.,According to quilt researcher and author, ,, what unfolded over the next 20 years was the gradual combining of textile traditions into a uniquely Japanese art form.,“It is the technical precision, attention to detail and aesthetic that set Japanese quilts apart,” Wong says.,“Because so many quilters are learning under rigorous teaching systems, they are wholly dedicated to creating flawless art,” she says. “The vast majority of quilters working today are finishing their quilts with hand quilting, and this is rare and completely unique to Japan.,“In addition to the meticulous hand stitches, Japanese quilters create stunning applique and pieced patchworks that are near perfect in their technical qualities. Lastly, the Japanese aesthetic — whether it’s the sense of wa, or the beautiful taupe palette, or indigo, or even contemporary colors and fabrics — many of these quilts are instantly recognizable around the world as distinctly Japanese.”,For Yawatagaki, the art of quilting is also a way to transform the past into something that will live into the future.,“It’s a way to pass these things on to the next generation,” Yawatagaki says. “We don’t, for example, wear kimono as much as we used to, but if we use the material in a quilt, this helps continue a part of Japanese heritage that needs to be preserved.”,The , will run from March 25 to 28. The Oyama pilgrimage quilt will be on display at , later this year.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The Japanese often say, , (“You eat with your eyes”), something I truly understood the first time I stayed at a ,, a traditional Japanese-style inn.,It was there that I was served a multi-course meal in an array of delicate, immaculately plated courses served on gorgeous ceramics of all shapes and sizes. The experience left an impression, and, as a result, researching and collecting Japanese tableware has since become a passion of mine.,
,Japanese artist and chef Kitaoji Rosanjin once likened tableware to a “kimono for food,” and the care that goes into , (plating) takes into consideration the food that’s served as well as the choice of plates, bowls and cups, and how they are placed.,Moritsuke is governed by a number of aesthetics, including a preference for odd numbers (seven patterns, five colors, three arrangement styles), contrast and the aim of re-creating elements of nature on a plate. The concept of , (negative space) applies to Japanese plating as well as calligraphy, architecture and the arts, and at least 30% of the plate should be left empty.,According to Japanese culinary expert and cookbook author Elizabeth Andoh, moritsuke considers the color, shape, seasonality, materials and textures of both foods and their serveware. Each vessel is chosen with careful attention to textural nuances, shape, and mouthfeel.,The manner in which food is arranged is carefully executed to showcase the chef’s skill and to present food in the most attractive way, including showing off the patterns or textures of chosen tableware. Unlike Western convention, the dishes used are rarely from a single kiln or artist, and part of the joy of Japanese place settings is the creativity this grants to mix and match different shapes, textures, heights and colors, as well as add seasonal accents.,
,
,As sourcing and choosing high-quality Japanese tableware can be overwhelming, particularly for overseas customers, a new company has taken the guesswork out of table arrangements and thoughtfully explains the history and various styles of Japanese ceramics, lacquerware and other accent pieces.,Musubi Lab, founded by brothers Mototsugu and Takatsugu Fusada, is headquartered in Setagaya’s Denen Mansion, which was formerly used as a calculation center for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.,The brothers’ love of traditional Japanese tableware came at an early age. The Fusada family relocated from Kobe to Ehime, where their father took the brothers to the Tobe ware kiln to make their own rice bowls. As adults, they realized that the traditional tableware culture they were familiar with was gradually disappearing and that it was difficult to find authentic tableware despite the popularity of Japanese food overseas, so they decided to connect — , — Japan and other countries.,Musubi Lab started a store specializing in Kutani ware called Japan Kutani Shop in May 2020. In June 2021, Musubi Lab launched ,, an online shop geared toward English-speaking countries that specializes in Kutani ware and other traditional ceramics and lacquerware. Musubi Kiln introduces traditional Japanese tableware and food culture for an international audience, including specialized webpages for restauranteurs, retail owners and cooking experts. The two shops have had more than 10,000 customers since opening.,In addition to highlighting various manufacturers and major Japanese ceramics styles (see sidebar), the website also profiles the artisans and techniques behind the works. By sharing the stories behind its pieces, Musubi Kiln helps its customers gain a deeper appreciation for traditional tableware and encourages a more meaningful dining experience. The store has been featured on a number of popular Japan-themed blogs and websites, including ,, , and Marc Matsumoto’s , as well as New York Magazine.,Part of Musubi Kiln’s mission is to reverse the decades-old decline of Japanese tableware sales. Compared to other manufacturing industries, the percentage of older workers is high in the ceramics industry, including traditional Japanese tableware studios, and sales of Japanese tableware have declined 75% over the past 20 years. Aging artisans, shrinking domestic demand and the fact that more and more kilns go out of business every year have all played a role.,However, in cooperation with the Kutani Ware Cooperative and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Musubi Lab hopes to pass on traditional techniques to a new generation of craftspeople, preserve traditional ceramics for future generations and stimulate interest in Japanese tableware that will reverse the drop in demand.,
,
,For those new to collecting Japanese place settings, Musubi Kiln recommends this authentic , (one soup and three sides) set. Icihiju sansai dining is a simplified form of ,, the highly ritualized banquet-style dining of the samurai nobility of the Muromachi Period (1392-1573).,A typical ichiju sansai place setting includes a rice bowl (,), soup bowl (,), medium plates for main dishes, small plates for side dishes and tiny plates for soy sauce, sauces, garnishes and seasonings. Depending on the type of meal being served, this may also include a , for steamed custards, a ramen bowl or a rectangular plate for grilled fish, sushi or sashimi.,In addition to its website, Musubi Kiln sends out informative digital newsletters and recently started an online group on Facebook dedicated to Japanese tableware.,To make it easier to start using Japanese tableware, its website also offers ,, recipes and tips for a wide range of holidays and celebratory events, including New Year’s festivities, Mother’s Day, seasonal themes, and traditional Japanese food and sake pairings, along with a convenient listing of all featured products, taking the guesswork out of pairing various elements in complementary styles and colors. The range of price points, worldwide shipping and wide selection of traditional and modern place settings means that customers can be assured of finding the perfect match.,By incorporating Musubi Kiln’s beautiful ceramics and lacquerware, the company envisions that each of us can create our own little world on our dining room tables. Musubi Kiln wants to share with people around the world a way of enjoying life unique to Japan — the more people who share their passion for traditional Japanese tableware, the stronger the power to support artisans and the traditional craft industry will be.,
,The production of Japanese pottery dates back 12,000 years to the prehistoric Jomon Period (10,000-200 B.C.). Japanese pottery continued to evolve over the next several centuries, with the first examples of Japanese porcelain dating to the 1600s.,
,
,Mino ware ceramics have been produced for more than 1,300 years. Mino ware is produced mainly in eastern Gifu Prefecture and currently accounts for around 50% of the total production of ceramics in Japan. There are more than 15 styles of Mino ware that have developed.,
,
,Hasami ware dates back to the Japanese invasion of the Korean Peninsula more than 400 years ago. Production is centered in northwestern Kyushu around the town of Hasami in Nagasaki. In 1978, Hasami ware was designated as a Traditional Japanese Craft by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.,
,
,Kutani ware pottery was established in 1655 by Toshiharu Maeda, the first daimyo of the Maeda clan in Kaga, Ishikawa Prefecture. It gained worldwide recognition at the 1873 World Exposition, where it was exhibited as “Japan Kutani.” Kutani ware is notable for its use of five colors (red, yellow, green, purple and Prussian blue), referred as Kutani, (the five Kutani colors).,
,Arita ware was first made in the 17th century, when raw porcelain material was discovered in Arita, Saga Prefecture. Since Arita was not located near the sea, exports were made from the nearest seaport, Imari, which is why Arita ware is known as Imari ware overseas. Major styles include Ko-Imari, Kakiemon and Nabeshima.,
,
,The tradition of Japanese lacquerware dates back to around 5,000 B.C. Wood is coated with a natural lacquer made from poison oak sap , that originates from the Japanese lacquer tree. The , technique of sprinkling gold or silver dust on the lacquer surface was developed during the Heian Period (794-1185), and lacquerware became widely used in architectural elements in addition to tableware and stationary items.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,“Deconstructing gender” has been fashion’s go-to place for a statement for some time now, and yet putting this phrase into practice takes a little more effort. My own professor in fashion once said, “Put a male and female mannequin next to each other and they are more similar than they are different,” which is very true — until you start cutting fabric for the garments that will hang from them. The way physical differences skew on average means that “unisex” generally refers to amorphous shapes that mostly obscure the body.,Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. Take designer Morinaga Kunihiko’s , collaboration with sportswear label Champion that was released on Jan. 9, which features pieces cut as expansive spheres, pyramids and cubes, but also drape elegantly over the body. The word “over” is key here, and there is nothing that clings to or reveals the body. That act of negating the gender of the body has been the defining feature of most mainstream unisex collections until now, a good match for the Japanese sense of space — , — between fabric and body. It is essentially a design decision that invites the wearer to decide just how much they want to gender the garment, perhaps belted in high to reveal a waist or allowed to hang free. The collection is also significantly cheaper than mainline catwalk Anrealage items, making this a good way to get involved for fans on a budget.,
,
,
,The same unisex goal has been achieved with a very different approach by fashion brand , in collaboration with Wacoal Men. Its new collection of boxer briefs is sized on the waist, but is designed to be worn by men and women with the assistance of very stretchy organic cotton. The goal here is laudable, and is a nice match for men seeking something simple yet form-hugging, and women looking for something neutral not drenched in lace.,However, in doing away with those gendered expressions one is inescapably left with neutrality, which can get a shrug from most customers. The point to take away here is that hypermasculine underwear already exists from the likes of Toot and TM Collection, two Japanese brands that have gone further than most for decades in creating anatomy articulated men’s underwear in sensuous materials and peacocking flourishes. Needless to say, hyperfeminine underwear for women exists just about everywhere you look. This middle ground is the one now being posited by fashion designers, and while it might be too soon to say how big the market actually is, there is clearly a growing number of people who don’t feel the need to express gender, even in the most intimate of garments.,
,
,Of course, things are not that simple, and there is another tangent that is currently the realm of fashion editorials and youth on social media, but which has the potential to reach the mainstream: the deliberate juxtaposition of highly gendered characteristics. This abandonment of gender binary in favor of a collage is the realm of edgy labels such as ,, which was founded in 2020 on the premise of creating a new culture in opposition to conventional ideas of gender. The resulting mix of drag queen makeup paired with beards and girls in zoot suits plays off a degree of shock that probably existed a decade or so ago, but isn’t going to be too jaw-dropping for anyone within commuting distance of Tokyo. But, then again, that is the point. This isn’t supposed to be a statement, but rather a lived reality that the idea of being ring-fenced by rules isn’t going to fly with this generation.,The cynics will probably say, “Well, we were all young once,” and there is a degree of truth to that. Youth will wriggle as you try to force them into strictly gendered suits as they head off come job-hunting season, but when the likes of Wacoal are jumping onboard this may be change that lasts.,But like this writer measuring up a mannequin in his own youth, the point when you come crashing down to Earth is when you are faced with the reality of the human body. Overall fashion trends are still dictated by streetwear-inspired oversized silhouettes, and how these trends last with heavily fitted clothes is another matter entirely.,
,
,Still, the Japanese fashion market is much more inclusive than those on the outside sometimes paint it, and there has been a host of brands catering to diverse body shapes in recent years. Launching this month, , is a new brand aimed at women who are 155 centimeters or shorter looking for fashion that is feminine, but doesn’t look like they picked it up in the children’s section. Sirin’s first collection is proof that creatives are finding and fixing these gaps in the market.,Ultimately, a diverse fashion market is one that includes everyone — even those who want to opt out of playing the gender game entirely.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Although the pandemic keeps disrupting international design fairs with cancellations, postponed events and limited visitor entry, there is still a wealth of small exhibitions and online alternatives introducing new Japanese ideas and products. This month, On: Design focuses on a selection of new brands, all participating in an initiative to support manufacturers in Osaka.,The “,,” taking place at,, in Tokyo’s Shinjuku Marui through March 31, has impressive official backing. Part of the,’s Osaka Product Ecosystem Creation Project, and a collaboration with the Osaka Prefectural Government, it introduces 20 brands designed by local makers that range from food factories to manufacturers and traditional craftspeople. Many of the new products can also be viewed on the, online exhibition platform.,
,Among the eclectic list of goods are healthy, high-protein , ramen noodles;,’s decorative , wooden sake cups, carved by Osaka , festival float carpenters;, metal-worked designer building blocks;, cotton towels that are dyed using Osaka-grown vegetables; and even an innovative bristle roller toothbrush called,.,Here are a few On: Design favorites from the lineup.,
,As a manufacturer of speaker horns and megaphones since 1945, , uses old-school sound mechanics, and a little humor, for its first foray into ,.,There are two types, both modeled on industrial horns the company is known for, and each using reflex horn loudspeaker mechanics to amplify sound without a power source. The NMP-001 looks just like the bell-shaped loudspeakers still used in factories and for public address systems, while a stockier NMP-002 imitates those seen on cargo ships and tankers. In keeping with their industrial roots, they both come in a minimalist gray.,Made of cast aluminum and designed for use indoors and outdoors, both the loudspeaker horns feature a rear slot for a smartphone and can boost sounds to about three times the original volume and to over 10 decibels.,Using speaker horns as an audio accessory seems an odd idea, and Noboru Denki amusingly describes the quality of sound as “nostalgic.” When it introduced the NMP-001 on the crowdfunding platform Greenfunding late last year, though, it achieved, of its target in just two months — proving that a little retro inspiration can go a long way.,
,When paper stamp maker , established itself last May, it launched with To-Mei-Han, a series of clear photopolymer montage stamp kits designed to be used with different inks and layered to create multicolored images. Now it has released ,, a new kit that cleverly utilizes the properties of photopolymer to make stamps even more versatile.,A firmer material than rubber or acrylic, photopolymer allows stamp designs to be finely detailed. It is also much better at ink transference, something that Tri-gram realized doesn’t necessarily have to be from just stamp to paper. Ka-Sa-Ne Stamp kits include four square photopolymer blocks etched with patterns that can be inked to transfer color onto flat stamps before they are used to print with.,The addition of pattern blocks means that each Ka-Sa-Ne kit of various shaped flat stamps can produce infinite designs. More than one pattern can be transferred in different colored inks onto a single stamp, which can be used on its own, too, while the pattern blocks themselves can also print directly onto paper.,
,
,UID. is a new brand from ,, a specialist in interior manufacturing for hotels and retailers, whose craftspeople have more than 30 years of experience in the metalworking industry. It takes its name from its motto “To create things that I want to continue to use Until I Die,” and launched this month with the Flamingo, a compact round table that can be packed flat for storage.,Multipurpose by design, the , looks like a sleek bar table when assembled, but is so much more. Its single pole leg is split into two parts and can be unscrewed and stored, hidden away, inside the hollow tabletop.,Use just one pole and it’s a low coffee table, use both and it extends into a taller side table. Pack it all away and it becomes an extra-low floor table or display platform, or it can be hung on a wall by a side handle, like a bright minimalist artwork. It’s simple, but smart.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer, I’m Dutch and Indian. I lived in India until the age of 10 and moved to Switzerland to go to boarding school.,
, I started cooking at 17. I’ve always loved food but living at a boarding school and eating cardboard bread and food with no flavor made me more passionate about cooking., I went to Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in Paris. I worked at two Michelin-starred restaurants in France. Although it gave me a strong base, I felt their styles were too myopic for my taste. It was fanaticism on a plate., I worked at Montreux Palace and Brasserie Bavaria in Switzerland, and Hotel Perla in Pamplona, Spain. My best experience was working in Italy at a rural pizzeria in Pozzuoli in Naples. I learned hunting, butchering, foraging and making charcuterie. It taught me a valuable lesson about hospitality and working with people from all walks of life., I was very interested in Japanese cuisine so I packed my bags and cooking knives and arrived in Osaka on a working holiday in 1999. I would have chosen Tokyo, but my girlfriend at the time was from Osaka and she thought the food in Osaka was better than in Tokyo., I couldn’t get hired for the first few months and my money started to run out. I was at the point of giving up when I met a hilarious English-speaking surfer at an , (pub). When I told him about my situation, he insisted that I work at his standing bar in Juso. I became the foreign , (beckoning cat) to attract more clients, which really improved my Japanese., I speak six languages and learning Japanese was definitely the hardest. But after almost 25 years in Japan I’ve started to dream in Japanese!, Bathing naked with other people., It was after working at the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo for five years. I returned to Osaka and opened my first restaurant, a Spanish tapas bar called Poron Poron. I ran it for nine years but decided to move on after the tapas boom ran its course., In Europe, if you offer outstanding food and have a good location then people will flock to your restaurant, but you will spend half your life getting the proper licenses. In Japan, it’s super easy to get a license to open a restaurant, but it takes longer for the community to welcome and accept you.,
,
, The ingredients and simplicity got me off the high horse of fine dining and down to warm, hearty food — value for money. My second restaurant failed after two years because I didn’t anticipate the cost-sensitivity of my customers. Lesson learned? Know your immediate surroundings and don’t try to make food people don’t understand., I believe food and cuisine should have no borders. I derive my food from French, Italian and Spanish cuisine, but I have taken a big leap by leaving my comfort zone and returning to my Asian roots. So it’s mostly Asian barbecue with Indian, Chinese, Korean and Filipino fusion dishes., Well, I have gone through 200-odd videos on YouTube and Netflix. I have watched some multiple times just to pick up tips for things they don’t mention. After 26 years in the kitchen, I have an approximate idea of what the end product will be like., Birria tacos. No one was making birria in Osaka so I did extensive research. I also got in touch with ex-classmates from school who are Mexican. I made them five times before serving them., Call me in advance and I can fix you almost anything that you miss from home. In the past I’ve made numerous requests including ,, a thick griddle cake that is the national dish of El Salvador; and ,, a crispy, deep-fried pork from the Philippines. I’ve also developed a tedious brining process to create New York delicatessen-style pastrami — the main difference is that my pastrami is smoked and not steamed., Brazilian chef Alex Atala and Filipino American chef Tom Cunanan, formerly of Bad Saint in New York City., I often do collaborations and drop-ins at restaurants in Osaka. I just like the camaraderie with other chefs, and I love meeting and talking to people., Ghost kitchens and satellite kitchens are the future. I used to be against a “one menu” restaurant, but the pandemic has upended the entire industry., In the future, I’d like to open a farm-to-table weekend restaurant., The day my daughter was born.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,My relationship with Japan started at an early age. In the UAE, we grew up watching Japanese animation and hearing from family members how Japan’s innovation,affected our economy. The UAE’s economy was based on pearl diving, but the advent of Mikimoto Kokichi’s cultured pearls disrupted our industry, which taught us to be more resilient. It’s interesting to think about how we went from watching Japanese animation shows such as “UFO Robot Grendizer,”,which were based on space exploration and how we collaborated with Japan to launch our first interplanetary space probe from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan as part of the Emirates Mars Mission.,
,
,My first visit to Japan was in the summer of 2000, but my first time living in the country was from 2003 to 2004. I lived in Beppu and Tokyo for six months each to attend Japanese language training and training with Japanese oil companies. This is where I developed an appreciation for Japan’s diversity.

			,Contributing writer,
, When I was a small kid, my parents moved the family to Itabashi (Ward). They wanted to get me into an international school and subsequently found out about Christian Academy in Japan.,
, In school I had a really good friend who was an enthusiastic Christian and he wanted me to join the faith. At the time, we were both in the fifth grade and I backed away because I was very wary … but just before high school graduation, it hit me that Christianity and I were a good fit., I wanted to study acting. Halfway through undergrad however, I realized that when you’re acting, you’re a messenger. You get better at conveying the message perhaps, but you have no control over the contents of the message. (Eventually,) I changed my major to creative writing., When the work starts, the actor already has the script in hand. A writer must begin the process much earlier, all alone, in front of a blank screen. Creating something from nothing requires a huge effort., It is, but once the script is done it becomes a different story. Films and theater are both composite art forms, with everyone involved bringing their own talent and contribution to the project. It becomes a bit like directing traffic, and very enjoyable. A great play is nothing but words on paper until it’s performed on stage., I wanted to do something to rescue modern Japanese culture. I saw that actors and performers carried a lot of clout here, so I chose to study acting. I thought that if I became a good actor, I could influence the culture and change it., In high school, I was riding the train and people were reading manga magazines with cover photos of bikini-clad girls. I got it that those photos were meant to sell magazines, and unless someone did something about it, the whole culture would be awash in cheap marketing gimmicks. It disturbed me., There were a couple of things, like the way people in the U.S. treated money. No one carried change and very few people had wallets. The bills were all crumpled in people’s pockets and they would try and get the creases out before using them for vending machines. Also, I was mildly shocked by all the partying on Friday nights and weekends., In Japan, people treat me like an American. I get called out on my “American-ness” a lot because of my international school background. On the other hand, in the U.S. I was told “you’re so Japanese.” I don’t belong completely to either culture., I’ve only worked professionally in Japan. I think American actors and performers are trained to speak up and give their opinions whereas the Japanese will go into a project ready to listen to the director and follow orders.,
,
, They will, once they feel absolutely safe about speaking up. they need to know there will be no consequences attached to stating their opinion., Japanese theater people like to hang out after rehearsals and go drinking together. People need to break the ice before they can feel comfortable working together. Obviously, this wasn’t possible for the past two years., The Bible. It’s wonderfully versatile and the one reading material that morphs constantly to fit my own life changes and circumstances., I never thought of the disciples like that but I find Peter very interesting. He was always the first on the scene, the first to try things out like walking on water, and he stuck with Jesus until the end., I once watched a documentary about an artisan who makes prosthetic limbs. This artisan was working with a guitarist who had lost his hand, and it was fascinating to see how they collaborated together to create the ultimate prosthetic hand, customized and calibrated to fit the needs of the guitarist. The process called for an extraordinary amount of empathy and imagination. I was fascinated and deeply inspired., In the mornings. I try to take time aside to read the Bible. It’s so engrossing if you read it from a historical perspective., I would have to say William Shakespeare. Did you know that ‘Hamlet’ is played somewhere in the world, every single day of the year? There is just no other scribe whose work has been so enduring and influential., I try to see kabuki once a month. Unfortunately, I tend to fall asleep or I find myself applying Western logic to the storyline, which kind of ruins the experience., There are so many people trying to do this one thing together, which has to be perfect every time. It potentially has the power to guide and heal people., I’m set to write and direct a feature film. And my second book is due for publishing.

			,Contributing writer, The first poem I wrote was for a class in high school. I loved how shutting out the world to write made me feel, and I have been doing it since then.,
, It was the idea of one of Tokyo Poetry Journal’s founding editors, Jeffrey Johnson. He tapped Marcellus Nealy to put it together, and then Marcellus brought me on board., When we put out our call for submissions, we were inundated with creative talent in response. The challenge became deciding what not to include — not for reasons having to do with creativity, but to create a general flow of the book. We were fortunate enough to have the help of Tokyo Poetry Journal’s editorial board and our wonderful copy editor Joy Waller., Is poetry not popular anymore? I cannot remember a time when I was not interested in poetry. It is a language that speaks to the heart of society as it exists from moment to moment., I believe it’s possible we’re not alone out here., My family, my mother especially. Jamaica will always be home to me, so there will always be a place for me to return to., The question of a brain drain cannot be sufficiently answered in this space. I will say two things about Jamaican migration, though: First, a brain drain is an unfortunate economic reality that affects Jamaica and all the other poorer nations that make up the Global South. Second, the fact there are Jamaican expats everywhere points to the notion that, culturally, we are very curious about the world outside our borders., I believe it is in part due to our being exposed to media from many countries. I also believe that it comes from the success of our education system in instilling a genuine curiosity about the world in young Jamaicans., Yes, a desire to see somewhere different from where I was raised and the possibility of travel to destinations beyond where I had ever imagined possible., What I like most about Japan? The general safety level. The least? Office culture.,
,
, Reparations are definitely due. Things like dismantling the Commonwealth, paying reparations to the tune of the value of the labor done by enslaved Africans to former colonies and dismantling institutional racism in Britain would be a start., First of all, I believe it is immoral for anyone to have that much wealth. If I had that, I would put it into environmentally sustainable initiatives that would employ citizens of poorer nations like Jamaica at livable wages. The question of making the world better is far too complex for any ideas I could come up with myself, of course., I teach 3- to 5-year-olds at Japanese kindergartens in the morning and then after-school lessons for elementary school students up to sixth grade., I am working on a sci-fi short fiction series that I have been posting in parts on (the online platform) ,. I am also writing a sci-fi novel that I hope to have finished by the end of this year., “The Expanse,” it’s the best original sci-fi series in years., I have always hated this question because I could never choose a favorite. Here’s a short list of authors whose works I love: Salman Rushdie, Roxane Gay, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Brit Bennett and Arundhati Roy., Yes: Derek Walcott, Louise Bennett-Coverley and Warsan Shire., Anyone can get into poetry because what’s out there is so diverse. I suggest people start out by reading poetry on themes that they personally relate to., Live poetry, music, drumming and just a good time communing with artists who love what they do. Great for a date night., Get through it.,The launch party for “Umoja, The Black Diaspora Edition” will take place as a masked event at Haretara Sora ni Mame Maite from 6 p.m. on Feb. 12. Admission is ¥3,500, which includes a copy of the book. The venue is located at Mon Cherie Daikanyama B2, 20-20 Daikanyama-cho, Shibuya Ward.

,At the airport, I was sitting in the lounge. And I realized it would be a taboo to actually speak into my phone and disrupt those around me. And I noticed on the plane, how everyone took off their shoes and lined them up.,Looking back, I realize both details really reflect the consideration cues of Japan society. We notice that in consumer behavior here for our own products. It’s one of the biggest drivers why non-combustible tobacco products are so big here. Consideration of others is as big or even bigger than the health considerations that drive other markets.,“Leaders don’t just create followers, they create more leaders.” It’s a huge source of pride how many of our people here in Tokyo go out to bigger jobs. In the last two months, I’ve sent out three people to take general manager jobs around the world.,I’ve been married for almost 22 years, I’ve managed to have four happy kids. They all seem to be doing well. That’s more important than anything else.,I love to travel, but that’s been challenging for the last two years. Since I’ve been here I’ve been playing a lot of golf. And I love food and cooking. I’ve gotten pretty good at cooking Mexican dishes. If you grow up in LA like I did, you can’t find the authentic food you want. In Japan, It’s never spicy enough!,I want to keep making it a more purpose-driven organization. I really want to finish up strong. From a business point of view, from the environmental point of view, as well as the organizational point of view. Then I’ll get some good people out, and I’ll walk away, happy that I left it better than when I came in.,For the full article, please visit: ,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,The seeds were sown in 2009 and it was launched in 2014, so it took about five years. The idea actually came from our corporate supporters. They said, “We love the grassroots activity, we love what you do — wouldn’t it be great if you could do other activities and have a structure around it.” So we thought, “OK, yes!” I think it is fair to say we were early adopters of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in that respect.,It has evolved into three key pillars: volunteering through the beach clean ups, public education via citizen science and art, and reconnecting to the marine environment via sailing. The third pillar ties in with Michel’s role as the Japan representative of Tiwal, a French manufacturer of small dinghies. We wanted to see how we could incorporate this into what we were doing — you can actually go out onto on to the water and understand your place in this beautiful and fragile marine environment. We are all about making connections — hearts, minds and nature.,We started with all kinds of things but we tried to come up with an umbrella that would capture the ideas we wanted. The English version stands for sustainability, environment/education, global citizen and open minds/outdoor. The name also reflects the sea, and it works in French, too!,As the founder of a not-for-profit that promotes care for the marine environment, what are your own favorite beaches?,If I go back to the Caribbean, then it’s the beaches back in Trinidad, and in Canada it’s the Great Lakes. When we go to France, it is the Mediterranean because Michel grew up there. During our time in Japan, when we lived in Kagoshima (before coming to Fujisawa) we liked the small local beaches in Akune city. They’re all beaches where we have roots. In fact, we are thinking of incorporating this idea into a future workshop as “What’s your water.”,There are two that come to mind: One is “If your dreams do not scare you, they aren’t big enough.” (Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia and the first elected female head of state in Africa). The other is “Be kind to yourself and to each other.”,For the full article, please visit: ,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,rakugo, It’s the traditional Japanese art of comic storytelling, originating in the early part of the Edo Period (1603-1868). The performer plays all the characters in the story while kneeling on a cushion, using only a paper fan and a , (a kind of cloth handkerchief) as props.,
, I was introduced to well-known rakugoka Katsura Shijaku (1939-99). He was the pioneer of rakugo in English and I was asked to be his , (stage assistant)., It was very much a man’s world when I first began performing in 1998. Most of the stories were written by men and most of the characters were male. Sometimes, I would be playing five men in one story! I felt it would be nice to have more female characters., Almost everyone has been very supportive, although in the beginning, I did receive a few comments saying that foreigners can’t understand the heart of rakugo, or that women couldn’t do rakugo — it was suggested that I learn to play the shamisen instead., Translating comedy is sometimes challenging as some of the classic tales were written over 100 years ago. When I wanted to perform one of those in English, I found that certain phrases and objects don’t have an equivalent word in English., I started to write my own stories. I also introduced female characters into some of the classics where appropriate, without losing the original feel of the story. Sometimes, I also use the traditional stories as a base and revamp them into modern stories., A lot of my ideas come from daily life. I love people-watching and I do it everywhere — on trains, in coffee shops, the local shopping street. I’ll talk to anyone! Human interactions provide plenty of quality comedic material., It’s important for the audience to be able to visualize the scene. I’m aware that some may not know much about Japanese culture, so I sometimes alter the stories so that everyone can enjoy them., If I perform the classic tale “Manju Kowai” (Scary Sweet Bean Cake), I change it to “Sushi Kowai” (Scary Sushi). Everyone knows what sushi is!, I do a stage check for the music, sound and lighting when I first arrive. There’s a brief rehearsal and then I change into my kimono. I love preparing my outfit for each show. I have a crazy collection of over 450 kimono and more than 200 , (sashes).,
,
, When performing at a school in India, I invited some of the children to come up and try rakugo for themselves. A little girl came running onto the stage and knelt down on the cushion. She was very excited, so I let her have her moment. Some of the teachers looked nervous but she did really well., Later, I heard that she had learning challenges, rarely spoke and was unable to be in a classroom with other children. We were all amazed., Yes, I’d been working on the Diamond Princess as a fly-on guest entertainer for five years. I was scheduled to perform on various cruises in 2020, but I needed surgery at the beginning of February, and then the ship went into quarantine around the same time. It was surreal watching our ship on the news every day, knowing that my shipmates were onboard., My cruises were all canceled and theaters were closed for a while. However, I was able to do some school shows, online seminars and socially distanced shows, following all the safety guidelines., I’ve been studying, writing new material, hiking up lots of mountains, going on long-distance bike rides and I finally learned to drive and got my driver’s license last year., We don’t have control over the situation but we do have a certain amount of control over how we react to it. Laughter is very powerful. If we are stressed but have a good laugh, we release the stress and feel energized and more positive., Yes, I’ve been receiving lots of emails and messages from groups, schools and individuals outside Japan with various interests in rakugo. It’s definitely becoming more well-known., That I was painfully shy as a child. Just the thought of speaking in front of a group of people I didn’t know would make me nauseous., Good, real-life observational comedy. Cringe-worthy stories that I can completely relate to., Plans for shows and fresh job offers are starting to come in. I’m excited about kickstarting some new projects and learning some new skills. I’m also going to continue to explore the great outdoors and get in more driving practice.,For more information on Diane Kichijitsu, visit ,.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,In December, I traveled to the United States for a family gathering. While there, オミクロンに感染しました (,, I caught the omicron variant).,Once I learned about my situation, I immediately got in touch with any 濃厚接触者 (,, close contacts) to apologize for 迷惑をかける (,, causing an inconvenience) to them.,
,In Japan, if you catch the 新型コロナウイルス (,, novel coronavirus) and think you may have been in close contact with someone, then you need to let them know and offer some kind of apology for causing 迷惑 (,, trouble/inconvenience). If the person is a family member or friend, then a quick text or phone call should do: コロナになってしまいました。もしかして感染させてしまったかもしれません。すみません (,, I’ve got COVID-19. You may have been infected. I’m sorry).,Or, you could go with a slightly less formal 検査で陽性が出ちゃった。コロナをうつしてしまったかもしれない。ごめんね (,, My test came back positive. I might have passed COVID to you. I’m sorry).,Since you’re telling people, you’ll need to inform your work as well. For this, a politely worded email with an apology for any inconvenience in the form of 申し訳ありません (,, literally: there’s no excuse) will suffice.,検査の結果、コロナに感染していることがわかりました。申し訳ありませんが、保健所の指導でしばらく自宅待機をさせていただきます (,, The test result showed that I have been infected with corona. I am very sorry, but under the guidance of the public health center, I will isolate at home for a while).,You could also go with: 家族がコロナを発症したため、濃厚接触者となりました。ご迷惑をおかけいたしますが、しばらくはテレワークをさせていただきます (,, A family member has contracted COVID-19 and I have become a close contact. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I will be teleworking for a while).,The apology is important. When the person who passed オミクロン (,, omicron) to me let me know, they didn’t include any kind of apology. This could be a personal thing, it could be a cultural thing — all I know is that, in Japan, a simple update doesn’t cut it.,Anyway, フライト前のPCR検査で陽性になりました。念のために家族も検査を受けたところ、家族全員が陽性でした ([,] ,, Before my flight the PCR test came back positive. Just in case, my family also took the test, and my entire family tested positive).,Our 症状 (,, symptoms) included 喉の痛み (,, sore throat), 咳 (,, cough), 鼻水 (,, runny nose) and 倦怠感 (,, malaise) — but, no 発熱 (,, fever). So, if I were going to relay these 症状 to a doctor in Japan I might say: 喉が痛くて、咳と鼻水が止まらないんです。それから体がだるいです。でも熱はないです (,, My throat hurts, I can’t stop coughing and my nose won’t stop running, and also I’m exhausted. But there is no fever). Take note that not all the symptoms listed (倦怠感, 発熱) are used word-for-word when speaking. Kind of like you wouldn’t say to a doctor in English, “I have malaise.” You’d probably say, “I’m really exhausted.”,We chose to 自己隔離 (,, self-isolate) until our COVID-19 tests came back negative. Two weeks later, 再度PCR検査を受けたが、結果は陰性でした (,, Again, I took the test, but [now] the results were negative). After that, I was able to get on a plane and fly back to Tokyo.,
,
,Upon arrival at Narita Airport, there are a lot of steps and procedures to follow as part of Japan’s efforts to keep new cases of 新型コロナウイルス from entering the country. The government has implemented strict 水際対策 (,, border measures), which has meant that non-Japanese tourists, prospective students and workers haven’t been allowed to enter. If you are a citizen or have residence in Japan, however, you will be able to enter, and once clearing initial screenings you are taken to a 待機施設 (,, quarantine facility). These locations are usually nearby hotels or, sometimes, government facilities such as a police academy dormitory. 隔離期間は滞在していた国や地域によって、三日間・六日間・十日間と異なる (,, The quarantine period you spend differs from three days to six days to 10 days depending on the country or region [you are traveling from]).,After you’re let out of 待機施設, you will be asked to abide by several rules. Two that I remember are: 他者との接触は行わないでください (,, Please do not make contact with others) and, for after you leave the facility, 公共交通機関を使用しないでください (,, Please do not use public transportation).,I found it interesting that the authorities chose to use the 〜ないでください (,, please do not) structure, since rules are often phrased with the stricter sounding 〜てはいけません (,) or 〜てはなりません (,) structures used to express the idea that you “must not” do something. For example, 公共交通機関を使ってはいけません (,, you must not use public transportation) tells me the speaker means business.,Along with the prohibitions, there are some requests. The first was about the アプリ (,, phone app) the government uses to monitor your health: 入国者健康居所確認アプリ「MySOS」をインストールし、健康状態の報告をし、アプリから通知が届いたら位置情報の確認を行なってください (,, Please install the immigration health confirmation app “MySOS,” report your health condition and, when you receive a notification from the app, confirm your location).,The second request involves how to interact with the アプリ: 位置情報を保管してください (,, please save your location information) and ビデオコールがあったときはスマートフォンのカメラをオンにして応答してください (,, turn on the camera on your smartphone when you respond to a video call).,I’ve said these are requests, but you must sign a pledge to comply with them and, if you don’t, you might be subject to consequences. Still, to stop a greater lockdown from happening, 今は我慢の時です (,, now is the time to have patience).,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,After a year in which Feb. 14 fell on a Sunday — and possibly two years of 在宅勤務 (,, working from home) due to the pandemic — women across Japan must be dreading the return of バレンタインデー (,, Valentine’s Day) at the office.,Why, might you ask, has a collective sigh of relief turned into, well, just a plain old chorus of sighs? It all comes down to the practice of giving out 義理チョコ (,, obligatory chocolates).,
,As anyone who has lived in Japan might know, the tradition here is that Valentine’s Day is a one-way holiday on which women give 本命チョコ (,, lit., “first choice” chocolate), to men they fancy. Over time, this has also resulted in the tradition of women bringing chocolates to the office and, since they can’t single one lucky guy out in front of everyone, giving chocolates to everyone: 義理チョコ.,Look at Valentine’s Day stories in the media over the past few years, however, and you’ll see a new trend emerging: Women are sick of giving out 義理チョコ.,It doesn’t matter that they’re meant to be on the receiving end of such gifts on ホワイトデー (,, White Day), which comes a month after Valentine’s on March 14. That’s seen as the day guys have to repay any sweet gifts they were given by buying chocolates in return. It’s a practice that is largely believed to have been started by chocolate companies to get people buying more of their products.,Times change and LGBTQ+ individuals are tired of the binaries involved with Valentine’s Day traditions. Women in the office don’t want to have to buy 義理チョコ, and some singles don’t want to have to partake in a holiday that is somehow designed to make them feel bad if they’re not in a relationship.,Valentine’s Day has some baggage but I like to think that it’s meant to be a celebration of 恋愛 (,, love). The word itself is made of two kanji meaning love: 恋 (,), romantic love that implies passion, and 愛 (ai), which represents a more lasting love that is built over time. You can see the former kanji in words such as 恋人 (,, lover), 恋歌 (,, love song) and 失恋 (,, broken heart). The kanji 愛 appears in terms like 愛情 (,, affection), 愛国 (,, love of country [patriotism]) and 博愛 (,, benevolence).,On this Valentine’s Day, I asked some people about 初恋 (,). It literally translates as “first love,” but it’s reserved for the kind of innocent and naive love that children discover on the playground (we sometimes call it “puppy love” in English). For those of you who love to study, this should make for good reading practice.,Oh, and one last tip from me: Don’t forget to buy some of that chocolate (even if it’s just for yourself) while the deals are still on!,

,By Kazuaki Ohno,小学校3年生の時でした。初めて一緒のクラスになった可愛い女の子がいてその子が今の妻です。前から顔は知っていたし、彼女の家に遊びに行ったこともあります。というのは、彼女には双子の兄がいて、僕はその兄と仲が良かったから。,家に行くと彼女が居間にいて、その時3人でおやつを食べたこともありました。美味しいクッキーだったのに、僕はほとんど喉を通らなかった。その時自分はすごく緊張してるんだなとわかりました。それは彼女のことが好きだから、というのは一緒のクラスになってから気づいたのです。,僕は大学に進んだけれど、彼女は高校を出てすぐ新宿にある有名デパートに就職しました。 1階のハンカチとかスカーフが販売されているところで接客をする彼女が見たくて、よく週末にそのデパートに通いました。,無事大学を卒業して、僕も就職して1年経った頃にプロポーズしました。他の女の子とも付き合ったことはありますが、小学校の時に彼女に感じた気持ちにはなれなかった。初恋が成就した僕は幸せ者なのかな。,(,.),I was in the third grade. It was the first time I was in the same class as this cute girl, and that girl is now my wife. I knew her face from before, and had even gone to her house to play. The reason being, she had a twin brother, and I was friends with him.,I went to their house and she was in the living room, at that time the three of us ate a snack together. The cookies were delicious, but I couldn’t get them down my throat. I realized that I was incredibly nervous back then. It was only after we shared the same classroom that I knew this was because I liked her.,I went to university, but she started working right after high school at a famous department store in Shinjuku. She worked in the section that sold handkerchiefs and scarves, and I often went to the store on weekends so I could see her tending to the customers. After safely graduating from university, I also began looking for work. A year went by and I proposed.,I’ve had relationships with other girls before but I never felt the same way that I felt in elementary school. I guess I’m a fortunate person to get to be with my first love.,
,By Satoko Takenaka,昔から奥手で初恋は小学校6年生の時でした。週末に通っていたバスケット・ボール教室のコーチに夢中になりました。当時大学2年生だった彼はわたしより8歳年上でものすごく大人の男の人、という感じでした。コーチに褒めてもらいたくて平日は学校から帰るとランニングと筋トレを一生懸命して、夜は『スラム・ダンク』を何度も読んでバスケの細かいルールを勉強しました。でもいざコーチの前に出ると思うような動きができず、悔しくて泣いたことも1度や2度ではありませんでした。コーチは彼の大学ではスター・プレイヤーで顔もかっこよくていかにもモテそう。,わたしのような子供は相手にしてもらえないとわかっていても必死で頑張って自分をアピールしていました。思えばあんなに真摯に何かに取り組んだことはないくらいに、バスケを練習していました。おかげで勉強はできなくなり、随分親に叱られました。,今はすっかりバスケに縁がなくなりましたけれど折に触れてコーチのことを思い出します。わたしは今40代なのでコーチは50代になった筈です。子供の頃にあった年の差は中年になってグッと縮まりました。今でも人だかりのある場所やイベント会場に行くと、人々の顔にコーチの面影を探してしまいます。どこかでばったりと会えたら、そんな想像をする自分に涙ぐんでしまいます。,(,),I was always a late bloomer so I experienced my first love in the sixth grade. I was going to basketball lessons on the weekends and became infatuated with the coach. At the time he was a second-year university student and eight years my senior, so in my eyes he seemed like a very adult man. I wanted so badly to be praised by him that on the weekdays after I got home from school I would go running and do muscle training, and at night I pored over “Slam Dunk” to learn the intricate rules of basketball. But when I was on the court in front of the coach I couldn’t move the way I wanted to. More than once, I was so frustrated that I cried.,The coach was a star player at his university and was also good-looking. He must have been really popular with the girls. I knew he would never give a kid like me a second glance, but I gave everything I had to try and impress him. In retrospect, I don’t think I have ever been so sincere in pouring my efforts into a single endeavor. Thanks to that, I couldn’t study and my parents really berated me.,Now I’m in my 40s so the coach will be in his 50s. In childhood, the age difference seemed vast but in middle age, not so much. Whenever I go out into a crowd or to an event, I find myself searching the faces for remnants of the coach’s features. If only I could bump into him somewhere. I get a little teary when I catch myself imagining such a thing.,
,By Kasumi Eguchi,息子は8歳で今小学2年生です。親バカと笑われるかもしれませんが、彼は誰にでも優しくて顔も可愛くてクラスの人気者。,母親のわたしにも色々とその日の出来事を話してくれます。夫はシフト勤務なので平日はいつも2人だけで夕食を済ませることが多いからです。この間デザートの苺を食べていたときに突然、「この苺、明日学校に持って行ってもいい？」と聞いてきました。え、どうして？と訪ねると「隣の席の子が苺が大好きだから」と。よく聞いてみると息子はその子に恋心を抱いたようで、なんとか彼女の関心を引こうと苺を持っていくことを思いついたようです。「今度家に連れてきなよ、苺をご馳走するから」と言い聞かせその場は収まりました。しかし内心はちょっと淋しかった。もうわたしは息子のナンバーワンではないのだなあ。これから大人になるまで何度も同じような気持ちになって、やがて結婚して本格的に手元を離れるのだなあ、と。,子どもの頃は恋とか愛とかよくわからなくても純粋に向き合えるのですよね。大人になるとなかなか「好き」という気持ちだけで行動はできない。今度の週末、苺を多めに買って息子の初恋の相手を我が家にお招きしようと思います。,(,),My son is 8 years old and in his second year of elementary school. You may laugh at me for being a doting parent, but he’s very popular in his class as he’s kind to everyone and has a cute little face.,He even tells me, his mother, all about his day. My husband works in shifts so on weekdays it’s often just the two of us at the dinner table. The other day when we were eating strawberries for dessert he suddenly piped up: “Can I bring these strawberries to school?” Taken aback I asked why and he said, “The girl in the seat next to me loves strawberries.” It turned out that my son felt feelings of love for this girl and he thought of bringing the strawberries as a ploy to get her attention. “Bring her over. I’ll treat her to strawberries,” I told him, and concluded the situation. But inside, I felt a little forlorn. I’m no longer No. 1 in my son’s life. As he grows up he’ll get these feelings of love over and over again and eventually he’ll marry and leave me for good.,When you’re a child, feelings of longing and love may not be comprehensible but you get to face those feelings with a pure heart. When you’re an adult, you can’t just act on feelings of liking someone. This weekend, I think I’ll buy more strawberries than usual and invite my son’s first love to our home.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Staff writer,When Sara Takanashi flew 103 meters into the air during the mixed ski jumping event at the Beijing Olympics last week, it seemed like a great start for Team Japan — until it was revealed that her jump wouldn’t count.,The reason? スーツ規定違反で失格になった (,, [She] was disqualified for violating suit regulations).,
,Takanashi wasn’t the only one to be disqualified for this reason, though. One jumper each from Austria and Germany, and two from Norway, all had their jumps disqualified for スーツ規定違反 (,, a suit regulation violation).,スキージャンプのスーツは表面積が大きくなるほど揚力が増し、飛距離が出やすくなるため、幅が厳密に規定されている (,, The width of the ski jumping suits is strictly regulated because the larger the surface area, the greater the lift and the easier it is [for athletes] to fly further).,So in order to be as 公平 (,, fair) as possible, 体のサイズに対して認められたスーツのゆとりが決められている (,, the roominess of one’s suit is decided by the size of one’s body).,Of course, this is something Olympic ski jumping athletes and their teams already know. Victory or defeat could depend on the suit, so it’s common practice to 違反しないギリギリのサイズのスーツで挑む (,, tackle [the event] with a suit that’s just barely big enough not to violate [the rules]).,I had no idea such rules existed and, judging by reactions to Takanashi’s 失格 (,, disqualification), I suspect many other fans didn’t either.,While trying to make sense of the rules, I became similarly puzzled by something else. Listening to the commentary on TV, I noticed that different words were used to refer to “rules” and “regulations.” I heard 規則 (,), 規定 (,) and 規制 (,). They all sound fairly similar, but there are slight differences.,The kanji 規 (,) is used to refer to 行動や判断のよりどころとなる基準 (,, a standard by which actions and decisions are guided). You’ll also see the kanji used in words like 規模 (,, scope/scale) and 規律 (,, observance/discipline). So the nuances that separate 規則, 規定 and 規制 come down to the kanji for 則 (,), 定 (,) and 制 (,). Let’s take a look at each.,規則 (,, Rules/conventions) is seen as the least severe of the trio. You’ll see it in set terms such as 規則正しく生活する (,, to live a well-regulated life) and 規則を守る (,, to abide by the rules).,You can pick up a slightly more nuanced understanding of the kanji in the verb 則する (,), which means ある事柄を基準としてそれに従う (,, to take one thing as a standard and to follow it).,It’s also useful to note here that the “thing” that sets the standard can change depending on the kanji 則 is paired with. For example, the terms 自然法則 (,, natural law) and 校則 (,, school regulations) both set their code of conduct on nature and the education system, respectively.,You may recognize the next kanji, 定, from words like 定食 (,, set meal), 定期券 (,, a seasonal/commuters ticket) and 安定 (,, stability). In verb form, 定 can also be read as 定める (,), which means 物事が一つの状態に落ち着いて動かないようになる (,, for something to become settled and stuck in one state). The verb is often used when something has been established: 方針を定める (,, to decide on policy).,While 規則 may contain the nuance of school rules or rules that are unofficial, 規定 feels more like “regulations” that have been defined by an authority. It’s useful to remember that the term 規定 is often used when discussing 法令の条文 (,n, articles of law or ordinances): 政治的、宗教的、人種的な宣伝活動を禁止するオリンピック憲章の規定がある (,, There are provisions/regulations in the Olympic Charter that prohibit political, religious and racial propaganda).,Finally, 規制 feels stricter as it implies there could be consequences if the rules are broken. You’ll see the latter kanji in words such as 制度 (,, system), 制限 (,, restrictions) and 制裁 (,, sanctions). The verb 制する (,) conveys the idea of direct control and manipulation, and is used to convey the idea of 人の行動などを押えとどめる (,, stopping people from taking certain actions).,北京市民の大半は新型コロナウイルス感染対策の規制により、北京五輪には参加できない (,, Most Beijing citizens cannot participate in the Beijing Olympics because of restrictions imposed by COVID-19 countermeasures).,In the aftermath of the controversy surrounding the スーツ規定違反, it has been reported that , (,, the International Ski Federation is considering changing its inspection methods and other regulations next season).,Whether or not that bears fruit, it goes to show that rules are everywhere. Luckily, the only rules we need to be concerned about here are 文法規則 (,, grammar rules).,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Knowing two languages must mean you can translate between them, right? Not necessarily. Here are a few tips for when you suddenly find yourself in a translator role.,Haven’t settled on a New Year’s resolution yet? Try setting a goal for yourself of reading a book in Japanese this year.,Listen closely to a Japanese speaker say ""chopsticks"" and ""bridge"" (both ""hashi"") and see if you can tell the difference. If you can, that's thanks to pitch-accent.,Entertainment translation is a constant juggling act, and viewer criticisms are sometimes made with a lack of understanding of how translation for subtitles and dubbed overlay work.,Learning Japanese may seem daunting for those diagnosed with dyslexia, but it turns out that fundamentals of the language actually make it easier to learn than its Western counterparts.,

			,Contributing writer,Every person who studies Japanese learns the four fundamental pillars of the language: reading, writing, speaking and listening. The fifth pillar that nobody tells you about, however, is translation.,Sure, you might assume that anyone who knows two different languages can easily translate one to the other. They know them, after all, it should be simple … right?,
,Nope, not the case. And I’ve heard many stories about how this presumption has led to more than a few awkward situations in the workplace. Even the most fluent among us have been called into a meeting by a superior to interpret for a client and, in the moment, accidentally caused insult by speaking too casually to them.,Translation and interpretation are themselves two different skills, each with their own quirks. The former, of course, is the act of conveying written text from one language to another, while the latter consists of conveying spoken dialogue from one language to another. It’s not a given that if you can do one, you can do the other — and even if you speak Japanese well it doesn’t guarantee you can do either.,Since most language learners in Japan will get thrown into the deep end at some point, I’ve come up with a few tips that might come in handy for you when it comes to suddenly finding yourself in the translator role.,To start, when you translate for the first time you’ll probably be tempted to write the English as you read the Japanese, taking a word-by-word approach. This may not be a good move as the translation often comes out awkward and clunky.,Take, for example, the following sentence: 先日送付していただきました、お見積書の件、質問が2件ございます (,). Going word by word this might be translated to, “The other day you sent it to me, an estimate form, I have two questions about it” — not the most natural English, right?,It helps to read the whole text to get a sense of the overall meaning before you start translating. The trick to it is being able to convey the core message of what is being communicated rather than relaying the meaning of each word. A more natural translation of the above sentence might be, “I have two questions regarding the estimates you sent the other day.”,Being succinct with your translation really is the key, especially in a business environment. In the latter, more accurate translation, “regarding” is doing a lot of the work when it comes to condensing the sentiment.,Trying to match punctuation can also slow readers down as the commas act like speed bumps and the full stops slow things down altogether. However, another trap when it comes to translating punctuation is automatically turning the かぎ括弧 (,, square brackets) — which look 「like this」 — into quotation marks.,On first glance, this makes sense since かぎ括弧 are used to quote what people say. However, they are also used to highlight key words and information in a given sentence.,For example: 「安心」「快適」な空の旅をお楽しみください (,). By translating this sentence into English literally, you may wind up with: “Safety” “comfortable” sky travel please enjoy. A better translation would be to say, “Please have a safe and comfortable flight.” If you were to include the かぎ括弧, it could read as: “Please have a ‘safe’ and ‘comfortable’ flight.” In English, those quotation marks could be interpreted as pointing out sarcasm or dubious information rather than highlighting key terms.,Another way punctuation can be used differently in Japanese is with the number of question marks. Take this sentence, for example: 今どこにいるの？？ (,),In Japanese, the double question marks convey a more casual tone. In English, however, extra question marks (or exclamation points) tend to convey urgency or even impatience: Where are you right now??,Direct translation can also be problematic if you are dealing with 和製英語 (,), which are Japanese expressions based on English words that are often written in katakana. Take the word クレーム (,, claim), for example. In English, “claim” would be defined as asserting a truth or demanding something. In Japanese, however, it is defined as a complaint (the Japanese definition comes from the idea that a claim “demands or requests something that is considered one’s due”).,In addition to 和製英語, regular Japanese words can have different meanings when translated because of cultural differences. For example, 部屋 (,) is rendered in English as “room,” but while the word in both languages refers to a division of a building enclosed by walls, a floor and a ceiling, in Japanese, “room” is also used to refer to an apartment.,Another tip I’d like to offer to any budding translators is to read your translation out loud. It’s easy to get stuck when you’re staring at a block of text for a while, and reading the translation aloud (or using text-to-speech software) can actually help you pick out sections in which the text is unclear or hard to understand.,It’s also a good idea to run a translation by a native speaker of the other language you’re working in. A second pair of eyes never hurts, and they may catch something you simply didn’t see.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The title of the Oscar-nominated film “ドライブ・マイ・カー” (“,,” “Drive My Car”), directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi and based on the short story by Haruki Murakami, is a metaphor. Or at least it was originally: , is steeped in sexual innuendo.,Metaphors and similes — or 比喩 (,) in Japanese — are an important part of the language, as they are in English. They demonstrate emphasis, function as a euphemism (like “Drive My Car” does in the song), and provide a vivid and expressive way to describe a feeling, action, object or state. They’re also a huge part of the Murakami story behind Japan’s most successful showing at the Academy Awards since the output of Akira Kurosawa. The film is nominated for best foreign film, best adapted screenplay, best director and, the ultimate, best picture.,
,“Drive My Car” is a loose interpretation of the Murakami story from his collection “女のいない男たち” (“,,” “Men Without Women”). Both the story and the film are about the actor Yusuke Kafuku, who is assigned a taciturn, young female chauffeur to drive him to rehearsals for a performance of the Anton Chekhov play “Uncle Vanya.” The thrust of the story focuses on Yusuke grappling with grieving for his deceased wife, who he discovered had been cheating on him before her death. While the movie takes several directions that the original story doesn’t, the themes of 嘆き(,, grief) and 演技 (,, acting) come to the forefront of both film and story.,The theme of acting is made crystal clear by the dialogue Murakami places at the end of the story. 「そして僕らはみんな演技をする」 (“,,” “And so we all act”), says Yusuke, concluding his discussion with the chauffeur, Misaki, about his attempt to befriend his wife’s lover to get to the bottom of their affair. Murakami cleverly overloads a story about acting with 比喩. It makes the reader feel powerfully like the truth itself is eluding them — everything in the story is like something else, a metaphor for something else. But nothing is ever itself: The truth that the characters or reader have been looking for.,Murakami’s writing is famously “close” to English for Japanese literature and often has a universality beyond culture and language. It makes him a great place to start reading Japanese for language learners. Here’s a look at some of the countless metaphors and comparisons in “Drive My Car,” with a breakdown of how to understand them in Japanese.,Japanese has many grammatical vehicles for 比喩. This is about half of the list that appears in Judy Wakabayashi’s “Japanese-English Translation”: のようだ (,), ように (,), みたいな (,), に似ている (,), と同じく (,), を思わせる (,), も同様 (,), と言って良い (,), とも言える (,), 疑うほど (,) and 気がする (,). Reading “Drive My Car,” it’s shocking how many of these appear in a relatively brief story. In fact, Murakami places multiple metaphors or similes on pretty much every page, and into nearly every single paragraph.,Let’s take a look at the most common ways to express metaphors in Japanese. The starting point is よう (,) and みたい (,), which can roughly be translated as “like,” as in a simile. These can also mean “seem” or “appear to,” which makes sense. These words are used to both express that something is representative for something else — a simile — and that something seems to be something. In both cases, the object that よう or みたい is modifying is obscured, not quite clear.,A good example of this is when Yusuke is describing the pain of recalling that his wife slept with other men: “想像は鋭利な刃物のように、時間をかけて容赦無く彼をを切り刻んだ” (“,,” “His imagination, like a sharp knife, constantly chopped him up without mercy”). Here, the 鋭利な刃物 (,, sharp knife) is a simile for the pain of thinking about infidelity. This is a typical metaphor in that the comparison helps us better and more vividly understand the way Yusuke is feeling.,But Murakami’s intentional destabilization of simile can be seen just a page later. Here, Yusuke is thinking about the women he slept with after his wife’s death: “妻との交わりで感じたような親密な喜びを、彼はそこに見いだすことはできなかった” (“,,” “Yusuke could never discover an intimate joy like sex with his wife [with other women]”). Murakami presents a simile — 親密な喜び (,, intimate joy) like having sex with his wife — but Yusuke could never experience the comparison in reality.,Different grammatical expressions for metaphors can be found throughout the story. When discussing his relationship with one of his wife’s lovers, Yusuke says, 「友達らしきものと言った方が正確かもしれないな」 (“,,” “It might be more accurate to call him something like a friend”). らしき (,) literally means “like” or “-ish.” It’s another way to both express a simile but also destabilize reality for Yusuke. He never achieves a true friendship, only 友達らしきもの (,) — something like a friendship.,Metaphors in “Drive My Car” are so fascinating because, normally, metaphors are a vehicle for comparison and clarity. バラの刺のような心 (,, A heart like a rose’s thorns) makes a reader understand more clearly what the “heart” in question is like. But in this story, the frequent use of 比喩 — and Yusuke’s inability to find the real thing behind the metaphor — actually makes a reader feel like the metaphors are getting us further from the object being described, not closer to it.,「そして僕らはみんな演技をする」. And so we keep on acting. Murakami isn’t using a metaphor here. What the characters are doing isn’t like acting, it actually is acting. They have to keep on living their lives even though they don’t understand the true meaning of their own actions or feelings. Grief can be so difficult to deal with that acting — which is, as Murakami shows us, using metaphors to understand the world and make decisions — simply becomes necessary at times. “Drive My Car” acknowledges this reality while also illustrating how painful the elusive connection of using metaphors can be.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Staff writer,Harrowing scenes from Ukraine continue to make headlines as Russia shows no signs of stopping its march into the independent nation. That has meant a lot of coverage on the news and a lot of new vocabulary.,The first kanji you might be noticing more is 露 (,/,/,). The character represents “dew,” “tears” and “exposure,” and you may have seen it in words like 露見 (,, discovery [of a plot/misdeed]) or 披露宴 (,, reception [for weddings]). However, this kanji also represents “Russia.”,
,Take a look at this headline from the Sankei Shimbun: , (,[,] ,, Japan protests “unfriendly country” designation by Russia). By using the 露 kanji on its own, rather than spelling out ロシア (,, Russia), the headline writer saves space.,Katakana is primarily used to write the names of foreign countries, but neighboring nations and those with historical significance to Japan also have kanji versions. It’s important to note that Ukraine is being written in katakana as ウクライナ (,).,ロシアとウクライナの緊張は、プーチンが旧ソ連諸国への影響力を示すことによってエスカレートした (,, Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated as [Russian President Vladimir] Putin sought to assert his influence over the former Soviet republic).,武力紛争を避けるために様々な国が外交的手段を尽くしてきた (,, Various countries have tried using diplomacy as a way to avoid an armed conflict).,But despite those efforts, ロシアの軍事侵攻が始まってしまった (,, Russia’s military invasion [of Ukraine] was still started).,When reading about the current conflict, it might be good to have a dictionary handy. One term that comes up fairly often is 外交的 (,, diplomatic). In the sentence above, the phrase 外交的手段 (gaikōteki shudan, diplomatic means) is being translated as “diplomacy.” You may have seen the term 外交的ボイコット (,, diplomatic boycott) used prior to the Beijing Olympics, though, as many nations refused to send representatives to the opening ceremony in protest of China’s record on 人権 (,, human rights).,In response to the 軍事侵攻 (,, military invasion), the United States and the European Union have imposed 経済制裁 (,, economic sanctions) on Russia that have so far included measures such as the 資産凍結 (,, assets freezing) of プーチン大統領 (,, President Putin) and the 承認停止 (shōnin teishi, suspension of approval) of the 天然ガスパイプライン「ノルドストリーム2」 (,, Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline). 経済制裁, 天然ガスパイプライン, I told you there would be a lot of new vocabulary.,As the conflict continues, so will the onslaught of terms used to describe it: 撃つ (,, to shoot), 攻撃 (,, attack), 襲撃 (,, assault), 銃撃 (,, gunfire), 撃墜 (,, shooting down [aircraft]). The kanji you want to remember here is 撃 (,/,[,]). It is defined as 強く打ち当てる (, ,, to hit hard), and if you see it in a Japanese word, it is likely that the word has to do with some kind of an attack.,撃 words are often paired with the verb する (,, to do), as in 銃撃音がする (,, there are sounds of gunfire), or with the verb 受ける (,, to receive), as in ウクライナは今ロシアから襲撃を受けている (,, Ukraine is now under assault from Russia).,While Putin has said that only 軍事施設 (,, military facilities) will be targeted, ウクライナの民間人の犠牲者は日に日に増え続けている (,, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine continues to grow day by day).,According to the UNHCR, more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries. But, ウクライナの避難民は400万人に増えるという試算もある (,, some estimates say the number of Ukrainian evacuees will rise to 4 million).,That’s why 日本政府もウクライナの避難民を受け入れると表明した (,, the Japanese government has announced that it will also accept Ukrainian evacuees [into this country]).,Speaking to ANN news, 日本在住のウクライナ人の一人はできるだけ早く、簡単な手続きで多くの避難民を受け入れて欲しいと言った (,, one Ukrainian resident living in Japan said that [he] hopes [Japan] will accept many evacuees as soon as possible through an easy process).,Living in Japan, even in peaceful times, you may have come across words such as 避難民 (,, evacuee) or 難民 (,, refugee) before since these terms are used when 災害 (,, disasters) occur.,The final term that you’re likely to see pop up more often in the next few months is 戦争 (,, war), comprising the kanji 戦 (,/,/,[,], war/battle) and 争 (,, ,[,], contend/dispute/argue).,At the moment, Ukraine is putting up fierce resistance against Russia, but 争いが続くと、悲しみも続いて、先が見通せない (,, if the fighting continues, so will the sadness, and it is impossible to see what lies ahead).,Video footage from NHK showed many Ukrainian residents in the capital city of キエフ (,, Kyiv) taking shelter in a subway station that also serves as a 防空壕 (,, air raid shelter).,「地下に子供もたくさんいてひどい状況です」 (“,”), ,.,「暴力と残酷な行為が早く終わることを願っています」 (“,” “I hope all this violence and cruelness ends soon”).,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,It’s time to say goodbye to another year and welcome in a new one. 2022 is almost here and with it the chance to celebrate a new beginning — another journey around the sun to make fresh starts.,Last year saw a muted new year celebration in Japan and across the world. It was right in the middle of the battle against COVID-19, with vaccination programs still in their early stages. Even the emperor’s annual new year greeting was canceled last year due to the pandemic, ,.,
,This year, things are a little different. Japan’s vaccine rates ,, and COVID-19 numbers appear to be relatively under control. The emperor and members of the imperial family are once again scheduled to appear on a balcony protected by glass for his greeting. The rise of the omicron variant might have cast gloom on some plans, but there is much to look forward to in the new year; there’s lots to celebrate and much to contemplate.,
,The new year in Japan has only been celebrated on the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1 for around 150 years. In 1873, five years into the Meiji Era (1868-1912), the nation made the shift to the Gregorian calendar. Previous to this, the date of the Japanese new year was decided by the lunisolar calendar, and, before that, by the lunar calendar (as with Chinese new year). The lunisolar , (“little new year”) is ,.,But Jan. 1 became the official New Year’s Day and, with it, most cultural events surrounding the new year moved as well, with celebrations lasting for three days. Before , (Japanese new year) officially begins, the last day of the year is marked with , (New Year’s Eve).,On Dec. 31, important errands are carried out and loose ends are taken care of, outstanding debts are paid, houses are cleaned and baths taken. The town of Oji, in Tokyo’s Kita Ward, typically holds its ,(fox procession) on this day, but it is one of many in-person events canceled due to the pandemic.,The first day of the new year is the time for a lot of significant firsts: , (the first letter exchanged), , (first calligraphy) and , (first dream). Whether it’s your first or 50th new year in Japan, there are many ways in which to say goodbye to 2021 and welcome in the start of 2022.,
,New year doesn’t have to be about going out for the night and dancing ‘til dawn. In fact, most people spend the holiday at home: Japan’s new year is a more family-centric event, similar to Christmas by Western standards.,Since 1951, NHK has been providing at-home New Year’s Eve entertainment in the form of “Kohaku Uta Gassen” (“Red and White Singing Battle”). The four-hour live singing contest is broadcast simultaneously on television and radio between 7 p.m. and 11:45 p.m. and features the year’s most popular singers split into teams — red (male) and white (female) — who compete to win votes from judges and the audience. The theme of this year’s 72nd edition is “Colorful,” in an attempt to add a much-needed splash of color to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.,For something a little more highbrow, do some channel surfing for the ,. This classical performance by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra counts down to the new year with a selection of memorable pieces — this year including Liszt, Rachmaninoff and John Williams’ “Star Wars” theme — and is broadcast live on the six channels from Shibuya’s Bunkamura concert hall. The public can , on the first few days of January.,
,
,What kind of celebration would it be without good food and a glass (or two) of something festive? New year in Japan has a long list of culinary traditions attached to it, meaning if you didn’t get your fill of Christmas treats, there’s a chance to try out a lot of traditional goodies. The holiday is marked by a selection of dishes collectively called ,, many of which are homophonically or visually attributed to good fortune.,First up, there’s the bowl of , (year-crossing noodle), an extra-long noodle eaten sometime before midnight on New Year’s Eve for a long life and good health in the year to come. The noodles are eaten with , (broth) and a scattering of spring onions; accompanying tempura, particularly large ,(prawns), is also popular. You can make this delight yourself, but supermarkets on New Year’s Eve will be packed full of varieties — and packed full of shoppers stocking up, too.,There’s a long list of other osechi dishes that vary from region to region. These usually include , — rolled omelette with , (fish cakes) — , (dried sardines cooked in soy sauce) for an abundant harvest and , (simmered black beans) for health in the year to come.,And then there’s ,. Thought to date back to the Muromachi Period (1392-1573), it’s one of the most ubiquitous components of new year feasts across the country. The cloudy , soup contains a location-dependent combination of , (rice cake), chicken and a variety of vegetables.,Don’t forget to wash it all down with a sip of ,: sake spiced with a mixture including dried ginger, , (Japanese pepper) and cinnamon. It symbolically alleviates any illness from the previous year and bestows a long life ahead.,
,In towns and cities throughout Japan, local landmarks are focal points for ringing in the new year. Shibuya’s scramble crossing New Year’s Eve countdown has ,, but was canceled last year due to the pandemic. It remains to be seen how many of these large celebrations have been put on hold again this year, but there are still places to get out and see a glimmer of new year celebrations where you live.,In Kasai Rinkai Park in Tokyo’s Edogawa Ward, the city’s second-largest park is open all night for new year celebrations. Events center around the 117-meter-tall Diamond and Flowers Ferris Wheel, which offers views of impressive Tokyo landmarks such as Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree. Expect live music performances as the clock strikes 12.,Aside from new year-specific events, there are also the seasonal illuminations that are still lighting up urban areas and make for a more private and COVID-safe way to see lights come new year. ,, for example, sees approximately 500,000 LEDs lighting up the city through Feb. 13.,
,
,At midnight, many people in Japan make their way to pray at a shrine or temple for ,, the first such visit of the year. Buddhist temples begin the year with , — ringing the , (large Buddhist temple bell) 108 times to symbolize the 108 worldly sins.,The sacred spaces see lines of visitors waiting to pray, so it might be a good idea to avoid taking a trip to particularly popular hatsumōde hotspots. Naritasan Shinshoji Temple in Chiba, Tokyo’s Meiji Jingu shrine and Senso-ji, Sumiyoshi Taisha in Osaka, and Nagano’s Zeko-ji all see millions pour through their gates throughout the three-day new year period.,One of the best ways to experience this tradition is to keep it local and visit a neighborhood shrine or temple. Many of these smaller venues are busy but not overcrowded, hosting groups of families, friends and couples alongside a handful of food stalls. Last year, even at smaller shrines there were coronavirus measures in place, such as disinfection stations at shrine entrances and social distancing.,During the visit, take a moment to pray for good fortune in the year ahead (read: pray for no more COVID-19, please).,
,
,Much like the first shrine visit of the year, , is also part of the traditional new year celebrations. Japan’s relationship with the rising sun is woven into its identity; The name of the nation itself, Nihon (or Nippon), means “sun’s origin” and the emperor himself was once believed to be related to the Shinto sun goddess, Amaterasu.,Watching the sun come up on a new year is a particularly poetic way to start 2022, whether you’ve been up all night partying or you’re an early riser keen to see the dawn. Spots for sunrise events can be found all over the country, though it’s worth noting that Mount Takao, Choshi Hill Observatory in Chiba and Yokohama’s Osanbashi are all popular destinations. Viewing venues also open up especially for the event, including the observation decks at Sunshine 60 and Tokyo Tower.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,In the quiet suburban streets of Kami-Ikebukuro in Tokyo stands a three-story house that looks no different from the rest. Inside, however, youths wearing historical Chinese costumes are absorbed in trying to solve a murder.,Welcome to the world of murder mystery games, where players sit around a table with a notepad and a pen in hand, trying to reason their way through a carefully woven script to find the culprit sitting among them.,
,Known as , in Chinese — literally “scripted murder” — these elaborate role-playing games have taken China’s youth by storm in recent years, with a consumer insight report by Meituan, China’s leading provider of on-demand online services, forecasting sales of 15.42 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in 2021 to 9.41 million consumers.,Poju Murder Mystery, which caters primarily to the Chinese diaspora in Tokyo, specializes in “immersive jubensha,” a more involved version of the games where players dress up as their assigned character and watch the business’s employees perform certain scenes on their behalf.,“We want players to feel like they are no longer themselves from the moment they step into the room,” says the store’s founder Zhang Yuexiao.,The 28-year-old native of Shanghai, who opened Poju this summer, says that the games’ explosive appeal lies in its ability to provide players with a glimpse into another life and, at times, into another era.,“Everyone is walking a decided path in life,” Zhang says. “But if they can experience something different, it may lead to new ideas and help them understand other people’s feelings.”,The concept of murder mystery games is not new, with classic deduction games like Cluedo and Werewolf now decades old. But while new incarnations of such games are enjoying a healthy boom in China, there are few signs they will break into Japan’s mainstream just yet.,
,
,Yoshiya Nishii, who has played around 600 times either as a participant or “game master” — the name given to the moderator — since starting in July 2019, said the spread of the games “is hindered by the high level of motivation required to play.”,The 44-year-old game developer cites the need for players to have strong literacy and communication skills, as well as the requirement to secure the exact number of people for each script, as among the reasons for the sluggish uptake.,“In a business sense, the games also have a disadvantage in that each can only be played once, making it difficult for even the most dedicated fans to spend more money on it,” Nishii adds.,Masashi Kawaguchi, founder and owner of Dear Spiele board game cafe in Tokyo’s Higashinakano area, says that the spread of the games in Japan was snuffed out by the pandemic before it could really blossom.,“If it wasn’t for COVID-19, there would have been quite a lot of major companies and people in the entertainment industry interested in the game,” he says.,Kawaguchi, who first brought murder mystery games into Japan in March 2018 after being introduced to them by a Taiwanese friend, says that it has proven difficult to convince people used to playing online amid the pandemic to shift to in-person games.,“It’s a game where people can really enjoy communicating, so those of us in the industry would prefer them to play face-to-face, but it’s hard to get online players to come out,” says Kawaguchi, who opened Trickster Inc., a specialty murder mystery room, in the Japanese capital in October 2020.,To encourage more people to try murder mystery games, both Kawaguchi and Nishii see live streaming play sessions or broadcasting them on TV as a potential avenue for growth.,
,
,Indeed, having a cast of celebrities play could boost the popularity of the games in Japan immensely as the craze didn’t really take off in China until variety program “Who’s The Murderer” popularized it in 2016.,The games have now become such a popular social activity for Chinese youth that Zhang says Poju has remained fully booked almost every weekend, despite starting operations amid the fifth wave of the pandemic.,“If people stay at home all the time, they start to get a little depressed and desperately want a chance to talk to others,” he says.,The markedly different attitudes toward playing in-person may also stem from the tendency for Chinese players to focus on the immersive experience itself rather than mystery-solving, while Japanese players place more importance on the logic of the narrative.,“Japanese people originally saw murder mystery games as deduction games, so they are more concerned about the consistency of the story rather than its level of immersion,” Kawaguchi says. “I think Japan has a culture of puzzle-solving, and it is very popular nowadays.”,Zhang, whose store offers nearly 100 different scripts directly imported from China, agrees that most Chinese players aren’t fussed about finding the murderer “as long as they were able to experience intense emotions in the process.”,But regardless of what players seek to get out of murder mystery games, Kawaguchi says its unique appeal is that everyone can have fun at the same table.,“There are people who enjoy deduction, people who enjoy the story, people who enjoy acting — everyone has their own way of enjoying it,” Kawaguchi says. “There are no other TRPGs (tabletop role-playing games) like it.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The past two years have brought more tigers than usual to our screens, with the rise to fame of Netflix documentary “Tiger King” and its subsequent spinoffs, and 2022 is set to bring the big cat front and center once again.,Early February will see the Year of the Ox draw to a close and the Year of the Tiger begin. The slow, gentle and hardworking nature of the ox, which manifested the mood of 2021, will be replaced by the speed, strength and power of the tiger in 2022.,
,According to the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang, whereby opposite forces come together in harmony, the transition from a yin ox to a yang tiger should be palpable.,The active and motivated tiger is “very different” from the slow, soft and passive ox, says Hong Kong-based Chinese and Western astrologer Jupiter Lai. The overall energy level of 2022 will therefore be higher than it was in 2021.,“This year, people are gaining back some vitality and strength,” Lai says. “They are more determined to achieve their goals.”,Much like how a tiger responds to the world, the upcoming 12 months can be expected to evoke self-confidence and enthusiasm as well as competence and courage in the face of challenges.,The tiger is characterized as being tough when facing adversity, with a strong sense of justice and a commitment to the greater good, again generating a positive imagery for 2022. However, Lai notes that the animal’s fierce hunting instinct may also generate competition and conflict among people.,
,
,Looking deeper, following the Chinese calendar that rotates in 60-year cycles based on 12 earthly branches, each represented by an animal year, and five element years — wood, fire, earth, metal and water — 2022 is the Year of the Water Tiger. While the Year of the Metal Ox’s element was earth, representing stability and nourishment, 2022’s element is wood, specifically yang wood.,“Wood is the only element that will grow, which signifies this is a year for growth and improvement,” Lai says. “The virtues signified by wood are benevolence and generosity, so these are the virtues we can manifest this year.”,The combination of wood and water — again, a yang force — in this Year of the Tiger is significant as “the water nourishes the wood, allowing it to grow,” Lai says. This indicates there “will be more support and resources for the Wood (Tiger) to grow, so people can look for help whenever they need it.”,In short, the alignment of this zodiac year’s components is auspicious in delivering fortitude and restoration in 2022. Furthermore, the tiger alone has long conjured positive images of power in East Asia, making it a particularly significant year for some.,“There have never been tigers living in Japan, but Japan inherited the Chinese concept of the tiger as the king of all beasts,” says Sylvain Jolivalt, an author specializing in Japanese history and legends. For this reason, he adds, the tiger tends to be associated with warriors and depicted with stripes on his head forming the Chinese character for king.,According to Chinese legend, after the Jade Emperor’s race to determine the order of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, the monkey put these stripes on the tiger to appease him for being only the third-fastest animal to win the contest.,The East Asian concept of the brave tiger as a champion or protector has been prevalent since ancient times. Japanese stories about the tiger can even be found in some of the country’s oldest works, including the “Chronicles of Japan,” or “Nihon Shoki,” which date from the eighth century.,
,
,In geomancy, the system of conceptualizing physical and spiritual environments, the White Tiger is one of the four mythological creatures (including the Azure Dragon, the Vermillion Bird and the Black Tortoise) that guard each of the four cardinal directions.,According to Choi Seonju, head of the Asia Arts Division at the National Museum of Korea, one of the earliest depictions of the tiger in Japan relates to this association. The White Tiger is painted on the burial chamber wall inside Takamatsuzuka Tomb, which was built in Nara Prefecture between the late seventh and early eighth century.,Similarly, the tiger and the dragon have long been regarded as auspicious creatures with great power. Viewed as the ultimate pair, they are frequently depicted alongside each other in Chinese Buddhism, feng shui, art and philosophy. While the tiger is considered master of the beasts, the dragon is considered master of the skies.,According to an ancient Chinese proverb, dragons control the clouds while tigers control the wind. This natural harmony is thought to create fertility and peace.,Evidence of these beliefs can be found in verses of Chinese classics, such as Yi Qing, which state that “dragon growls, clouds arise; tiger roars, winds form.” When these texts reached Japan, they influenced Japanese society and culture, Jolivalt says.,One example is the practice of people praying to the tiger or performing dances to the tiger (,or ,) in an effort to prevent natural disasters. This custom was particularly common along the Pacific coast of Tohoku, and many areas continue to hold tiger-related festivals to this day.,In Kami, Miyagi Prefecture, local residents have been performing the Fire Protection Tiger Dance Festival for more than 650 years. The event began due to the prevalence of strong winds that rushed down the Ou mountains in the dry spring and summer months, causing wildfires.,
,
,Today, residents dressed as tigers move carefully from rooftop to rooftop to bless each home and pray for the tiger to control the local winds by performing dances. Tiger-themed floats accompanied by music and dancing also proceed through the town.,Other towns holding tiger dances for protection include Kamaishi and Ofunato in Iwate Prefecture, Kesennuma in Miyagi Prefecture and Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture.,Over the centuries, Shinto shrines have also adopted some activities related to the power of the tiger. Jolivalt points to the Grand Festival of Hachinohe Sansha Taisai in Aomori Prefecture, held from July 31 to Aug. 4, which features portable shrines and tiger dances. Any spectator whose head is ceremoniously bitten by a dancing tiger is said to be blessed with good health.,The tiger is also one of the animals, along with dragons and foxes, chosen by Shintoism to be depicted as ,, the pair of lion-like statues guarding the entrance to inner shrines.,Similarly, the tiger has significance in Buddhism due to its relationship to the time of day. According to Chinese astrology, the 12 zodiac animals represent different times of day and different days of the month as well as years. The tiger’s hours are between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., the time when farmers are said to rise.,Legend has it that Bishamonten, the god of good fortune, appeared to Prince Shotoku during these hours of the tiger, some 1,400 years ago. Not only that, it was the Day of the Tiger and Year of the Tiger, too. Prince Shotoku was praying ahead of an important battle and Bishamonten responded by sharing the secrets of victory with him. This allowed Prince Shotoku to defeat his enemies and go on to promote Buddhism in Japan.,To express his gratitude, Prince Shotoku established Shigisan Chogosonshi-ji temple atop Mount Shigi in Nara Prefecture, where he witnessed Bishamonten. Since then, tigers have been symbolic guardians of this temple and are still represented through the grounds to this day. Visitors can see a giant 6-meter-long tiger statue, numerous paper representations of the tiger and a tiger tunnel with a gaping mouth.,Reflecting the role that the tiger played in this encounter, two tigers were chosen as the ,at Bishamonten Zenkokuji temple in Kagurazaka, Tokyo. This structure was first built in 1595 by order of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was a fan of tigers. He commissioned artists from the prestigious Kano school to paint the animals on the inner walls of Nijo Castle in Kyoto, Japan’s capital at that time. The tigers were featured solely in rooms used to welcome high-ranking visitors as one way to express the power of the ruler.,
,
,The artists had never seen a tiger, so they relied on the stories of adventurers who had seen them in China. Since tigers were typically described as giant cat-like creatures, many of the depictions show them in cute poses similar to domesticated cats, but it is said the legend of the tiger at that time would have allowed the castle dwellers to succeed in their dual purpose of impressing and intimidating their guests.,For the same reason, numerous paintings of tigers can be found in Nagoya Castle’s Honmaru Goten Palace. Its Ichi-no-ma and Ni-no-ma reception rooms for VIPs are adorned with depictions of tigers, which were considered male at that time, and leopards, which were considered female. All were created using descriptions from books and animal skins from China.,Edo Castle and many Zen Buddhism temples also called on artists to draw from tiger imagery to decorate their walls, screens and sliding doors, often alongside dragons due to their historic pairing. This kind of art was particularly popular among samurai as the dragon and tiger were believed to symbolize their military might, Seonju says.,“The dynamic composition of paired folding screens depicting a dragon and tiger staring at each other from each side was considered appropriate as an interior decoration,” he says.,
,
,Another reason for this frequent theme for paintings in wealthy warriors’ interiors, says Jolivalt, is that the tiger and dragon were “frequently used to describe two heroes or great men who fight each other.” The most famous pair were warlords Takeda Shigen, who was known as the “Dragon of Kai Province,” and Uesugi Kenshin, who was known as the “Tiger of Echigo Province.”,Meanwhile, in geography, the relationship between each earthly branch of the Chinese zodiac and a direction has influenced the development of some of Japan’s major cities.,As northeast is considered the origin of , (demon gate) from where bad influences enter, temples were built to the northeast of Japan’s capitals as a means of protection, including Todai Temple in Nara and Enryaku Temple in Kyoto. Jolivalt says the tiger-skinned loin cloth and bovine horns of the , (demon) of Japanese folklore are a nod to the connection between these evil influences and the direction of the tiger and ox.,
,
,According to Jeffrey Kotyk, a researcher of foreign astrology in medieval East Asia at the University of British Columbia, the tiger and the ox share the cardinal direction northeast.,
,
,The most well-known reference to the tiger that remains in Japan today, though, is perhaps Tokyo’s Toranomon. It was named after the southernmost gate of Edo Castle, what was known as the Tiger’s Gate, but the reason remains unclear. Some say the district received its moniker because of a cherry blossom tree at the gate whose branches resembled a tiger’s tail. Others say the Tora-no-Mon gate was named before samurai departed for battle, in recognition of the power and ferocity of the tiger. Still another theory is that the gate was the attempted entry point of a tiger that had been gifted to Japan from the Korean Peninsula. On realizing the cage was too big to pass through, the gate was knocked down, rebuilt and subsequently renamed.,Whatever the reason, it is clear that the tiger has long been in the hearts and minds of Japanese people. In some way or another, the Year of the Tiger and the associated astrology and beliefs about the big cat have influenced the religious, political, social and cultural landscape of Japan for centuries.,This year, it is fitting that Setsubun — a time when , are symbolically cast out from homes and good fortune is invited in — falls on Feb. 3, the last day of the Year of the Ox. As people “cleanse” their homes and welcome in luck to mark the start of spring, they are also preparing to mark the start of the Year of the Tiger — a year set to be characterized by strength, generosity and growth.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,With the coronavirus pandemic reducing chances for people to meet in person, a large number of companies in Japan, including several of its largest, have turned to an AI-powered dating app to help their employees find love, and hopefully become happier and more productive workers as a result.,In all, about 800 firms and organizations across the country have signed up to the app called Aill goen, partly attracted by the fact that the pool of potential matches is limited to employees of the participating companies — thus providing “a secure and safe platform,” according to the developers of the service.,
,“My goal was to create a platform that would make it easier for employees to achieve a work-life balance and in turn boost the company’s growth as well,” says China Toyoshima, CEO of Aill Inc., the Tokyo-based startup that launched the service in November 2020.,“Employers were worried about the mental health of their workers, who were largely staying at home with almost no physical interaction during the pandemic,” she says, referring to the widespread trend of working remotely.,With the developers also stressing the high rate of dates arising out of use of the app’s innovative artificial intelligence features, the firms to have signed up so far include big-name companies such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Mizuho Securities Co., All Nippon Airways Co. and The Mainichi Newspapers Co.,The service is being provided as part of the package of welfare and benefits programs that many firms offer their employees, which have already in some cases traditionally included financial support for workers who use marriage agencies.,But for employees, Aill goen is a much cheaper option. It costs ¥6,000 ($52) per month, with some companies shouldering all or part of the monthly fee. The services of conventional marriage agencies, in contrast, cost roughly double that, along with hefty admission fees running sometimes into hundreds of thousands of yen that individuals may need to shoulder themselves.,While there are dating apps across the world with AI-assisted features, such as figuring out users’ preferences regarding a partner’s appearance, Aill goen’s approach is to focus on intervening during initial text chats, suggesting when someone should ask for a date and what questions to ask to facilitate conversations — the kind of advice one might expect from a best friend.,For example, the AI engine might “coax a man to ask a woman out on a movie date or suggest he wait a while (to ask) if it judges that it’s too soon to make a move,” Toyoshima says.,The AI assists only when it determines the pair’s conversation has hit a standstill and its “intervention is required to ease the situation,” she says.,As of December, 76% of active users who had utilized the app’s AI support were able to arrange dates, according to a survey by the startup.,Kyushu Economic Federation, a business lobby in southwestern Japan known as Kyukeiren, adopted the service in March with the aim of enhancing the employees’ quality of life and boosting their productivity and performance at work.,The economic body had the service tailored so that the pool of potential matches is limited to users belonging to its member companies, says Izumi Tokisato, associate general manager at the organization’s regional policy planning division.,“When people get into their 30s and 40s, they become reluctant to use dating apps, but if the app is introduced through a recognized organization then it makes it easier for them to take the first step,” Tokisato says.,About a dozen Kyukeiren member companies have introduced the service to their employees, with some through their labor unions.,For Izua Kano, incubation director at NTT Docomo Ventures Inc., who has been involved in the service’s development since 2019, the makeup of the pool of potential partners is the key to the spread of the app.,Having the subscriber base comprised of professionals working at companies of similar scale “makes it easy for users to connect with each other,” says Kano, 45, adding that there have been “a few successes” among users of the app at his parent company NTT Docomo Inc.,Toyoshima, 36, says she came up with the idea of developing the service in 2018 after becoming a candidate for an executive-level position while working at a major Japanese pharmaceutical company.,Promotion meant long working hours and Toyoshima was concerned about her personal life as a majority of women in higher positions then were single with hardly any time to pursue romantic interests.,“Companies want the employees to show initiative at work, but the truth is that employees are tired as a result of overwork and have no time for their personal lives,” a factor that hinders the company’s growth, Toyoshima says.,But acknowledging that the professionals who were her target users had little time to spare meant it was important to maximize the chances of success. To avoid “heartbreaks and rejections,” it was necessary to turn to AI.,This led her to Hidenori Kawamura, a professor at Hokkaido University in northern Japan, who with two other researchers developed the AI for two years through deep learning and machine learning, among other methodologies.,The result was an app whose features also include a pair compatibility chart, as well as a bar displaying how much a potential partner appears to like a user based on how text chats are going.,“It is better to meet people after understanding them to some extent and knowing how much they like you,” Toyoshima says.,Aill’s service comes both amid a boom in use of online dating services and increased central government financial support for municipalities mobilizing AI and big data for marriage assistance amid the declining birthrate in the country.,The government earmarked ¥2 billion to support local governments’ matchmaking efforts in the fiscal year that started in April, with the ratio of state subsidy raised from half to two-thirds when AI assistance is incorporated.,The overall size of the online matchmaking market in Japan, meanwhile, has nearly quadrupled in size between 2016 and 2020 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly, according to a unit of CyberAgent Inc.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The founder of a youth movement advocating sexual and reproductive health and rights in Japan is on a mission to improve access to emergency contraception for women nationwide.,Kazuko Fukuda, founder of Nandenaino (Why don’t we have it?), says the emergence of COVID-19 has raised the profile of gender issues in Japan, providing health organizations with a golden opportunity to push for increased education on women’s reproductive rights.,
,“We’re getting more attention from the authorities than we’ve ever had before,” Fukuda says.,According to the Japan Family Planning Association, just 2.6% of women currently take birth-control medication, with condoms and the withdrawal method most commonly used by sexually active couples to prevent unwanted pregnancies.,Morning-after pills are available but they’re expensive compared to other countries, costing between ¥6,000 and ¥20,000 and only distributed to those who are able to provide a doctor’s prescription.,Abortion pills are not currently available in Japan.,Fukuda, 27, has first-hand experience of the options that are available to women overseas, leaving Japan to study in Sweden in 2016. She found the experience abroad surprisingly liberating.,“I didn’t feel judged anymore,” Fukuda says. “Asking for birth-control pills in Japan is publicly admitting that you are sexually active and this is frowned upon for women in Japanese society. In the eyes of the men, including doctors during consultations, we are seen as women obsessed with sex.”,Now based in Rwanda, where she works at the U.N. Population Fund as a program analyst, Fukuda continues to keep an eye on the situation back home.,She says Nandenaino will continue its education outreach programs and attempts to improve access to morning-after pills. The organization also wants health authorities to approve abortion pills in Japan, as well as give women access to an abortion without first having to obtain the written consent of the father.,The Maternal Health Act stipulates that doctors must obtain the consent of the woman and her spouse when carrying out an abortion. If a woman seeking an abortion is unmarried, many medical institutions insist on obtaining the man’s consent in fear of possible lawsuits — an unimaginable situation if the pregnancy is the result of a sexual assault.,In 2020, a woman in an abusive relationship was denied access to an abortion by several medical institutions because she was unable to get consent for the procedure from her partner. Following subsequent criticism of the case from advocacy groups, the health ministry last year ruled that consent of a partner or spouse isn’t required for an abortion in cases of domestic violence.,Despite such progress, Fukuda says that more can be done to improve basic education surrounding sexual health.,Practically speaking, it’s expensive for many young women to be taking regular birth-control pills, costing between ¥2,000 and ¥3,000 every month.,And then there’s the need to break down the social stigma associated with taking birth-control pills.,“Influenced by a strict hygiene policy after the Meiji Restoration as well as shifting gender roles in more modern times, independent and sexually active women were believed to be abnormal,” says Sakie Niwa, a gynecologist in Nagoya. “Shame set in and, even nowadays, such a mindset is unfortunately still strong.”,It also doesn’t seem to matter what age a woman might be, Fukuda says.,“I have received a number of messages from women in their 40s who are desperate because they have already raised children and didn’t want to be pregnant again,” Fukuda says. “However, they don’t know how to say ‘no’ to their husbands.”,
,
,With COVID-19 restrictions and related anxieties preventing many women from accessing health services when they need it most, authorities have shown a little more openness in embracing change.,In October, Fukuda joined Pilcon head Asuka Someya and Sakiko Enmi, an obstetrician who has been a vocal advocate for better access to oral contraceptives, to give a presentation on reproductive rights at the health ministry.,“It was encouraging that they would invite young women such as us to speak to them,” Fukuda says.,Even so, the trio still have some way to go to shift entrenched attitudes in the health system, with one senior member of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology reportedly saying he feared that young people would abuse the morning-after pill if it became too readily available.,Someya says birth-control issues are important as they’re directly related to the country’s abortion rate.,According to data compiled by Pilcon, about 19,000 abortions are performed on women under the age of 20 each year in Japan, with around 160,000 abortions in total carried out annually.,Abortions in Japan are not cheap, with medical institutions charging between ¥100,000 and ¥200,000 for a procedure to be carried out.,“Some women have a child because they were not sufficiently informed or could not afford to pay for the abortion procedure,” Someya says.,Someya says the introduction of abortion pills, which were first approved in France in 1988 and are now available in more than 70 countries worldwide, could help to reduce expenses, noting that the cost of a pill overseas was typically less than ¥1,000.,The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology recently reported that 41% of gynecologists were against the introduction of abortion pills, although the group didn’t wish to commit to making such medication available free of charge.,“The society said that a pill would cost about ¥100,000,” Fukuda says. “Nobody will be able to afford such medication at this rate. We need it to be accessible.”,The health ministry is currently preparing to conduct a new survey on the need for contraception in Japan.,Reproductive rights advocates, however, argue that they already have the data from multiple sources and such moves are merely kicking the can down the road unnecessarily.,U.K. pharmaceutical company Linepharma applied to the health ministry for approval of two abortion pills in December — mifepristone and misoprostol — but warned that the approval process could take at least a year to complete.,Fukuda worries about the practical impact of such delays on women in Japan, especially as it took more than 40 years for authorities to approve birth-control pills in the first place.,“While everybody keeps discussing the issue, I see tons of women who can’t access those pills,” she says. “We talk about the glass ceiling as a way to have people change their mindset, but it feels more like stone than glass. It’s incredibly hard to break through.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Her 118th birthday wish is “to die soon.” But in the meantime, Lucile Randon, better-known as “Sister Andre,” always keeps her door open for any visitor who might want to say hello.,Sister Andre is the oldest-known woman in France and Europe, and the second-oldest in the world after Kane Tanaka, a 119-year-old who lives in Japan.,
,She was born in Ales, southern France, on Feb. 11, 1904, the year that New York opened its first subway, the Tour de France had only been run once and World War I was still a decade away.,In her room in a retirement home in the southern city of Toulon, Sister Andre has a single bed, a Virgin Mary statue and a radio which she never turns on anymore. The outside world, she says, is too stressful.,Most of the time she sits in her wheelchair, her head tilted to one side, her blind eyes shut.,Is she praying, thinking or napping? It’s hard to say. But when she speaks, her voice is present and her recollections vivid.,Her daily routine starts at 7 a.m. when she is woken up and taken to breakfast, before being wheeled to morning mass which she, always dressed in her nun’s habit, never misses.,
,“It’s awful that I depend on others for everything I do,” said Sister Andre, who worked full time until the late 1970s and took care of other, often younger, home residents until she was 100.,“I’m happy when I have company,” she said — especially that of David Tavella, a staffer at the home that she has been living in for a decade, and her favorite companion. “He’s charming,” she said, grasping his hand.,Tavella also acts as her press agent, fielding interview requests from reporters, sifting through the many boxes of chocolates sent by admirers and checking her post.,
,
,Among her letters are handwritten New Year’s wishes for 2022 sent by Emmanuel Macron — who is the 18th French president in Sister Andre’s lifetime — which he signed off with “Yours very respectfully.”,Most centenarians are found in the world’s so-called blue zones where people live longer than average: They are in Okinawa in Japan, on the Italian island of Sardinia, the Greek island of Ikaria, the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica and in the Californian city of Loma Linda.,France, although no blue zone, was still home to the world’s oldest person with certified birth records, Jeanne Calment, who lived in Provence, dying in 1997 in Arles age 122.,The man presumed to be the oldest in France also calls the south of the country home. Andre Boite is one of the very few male super-centenarians, a term defined as living beyond 110 years.,At 111, Boite still lives in his own home, likes wearing three-piece suits and stays away from reporters.,
,
,In 2015, there were half a million people over 100 in the world, with the U.N. saying this figure could grow to 25 million by the end of the century.,France alone has 30,000 centenarians compared with only 200 in 1950, according to statistics institute Insee, with some 40 of them 110 or older.,
,Among them is Hermine Saubion who, when reminded of her age, says: “That’s old, that’s not young, I’m holding up.”,But when she wakes up from a nap in her wheelchair at the retirement home canteen in Banon, in the foothills of the Alps, her face lights up with a smile, and she looks attentively at her visitor.,Saubion has no specific illness, but her body has gone immobile, and she is almost deaf, picking up only the occasional word, which isolates her from her surroundings.,
,
,Yet, “if we leave her alone in one place for too long, she protests loudly,” said Julien Fregni, a carer here.,Saubion, who is from Marseille and became a resident in the home two years ago, said she never expected that she and her sister Emilienne, who is 102, would live this long.,Centenarians such as Sister Andre and Hermine Saubion often get by without pharmaceutical drugs, which is “probably one of the secrets of their longevity,” said Sister Andre’s doctor, Genevieve Haggai Driguez.,
,
,“Nothing can touch her,” the doctor said of Sister Andre, whose physical shape she calls “absolutely incredible.”,Sister Andre herself puts her resilience down to the fact that she got through the Spanish flu, a deadly wave of influenza in 1918, unharmed.,She may be on to something: Researchers have observed that people born before the Spanish flu have better resistance to COVID-19 than those born later.,
,Nearby, in a retirement home in Valreas in Provence, lives Aline Blain, a 110-year-old retired teacher.,Known to be sometimes bossy and sometimes sweet, Blain likes to read Paris Match, a celebrity magazine.,Her daughter Monique, 76, comes almost every day to look after her mother who says those visits are “the most important thing for me.”,
,
,She is among the lucky ones. Many people this old have nobody to share their life’s memories with, because most friends and family of their generation are already gone.,Their own death, meanwhile, rarely holds any taboos for the supercentenarians.,“We’re waiting. We’re waiting for the end, for death. It will come,” said Saubion.,Sister Andre even admits to a certain impatience. “To be alone all day with the pain is no fun,” she said, but “God is not hearing me, he must be deaf.”,Scientists haven’t uncovered all the secrets for a long life, but they have some idea of what it takes.,
,
,“Longevity goes hand-in-hand with material wealth, and with democracy, specifically social democracy,” said Jean-Marie Robine, a demographer and gerontologist at Inserm, a biomedical research institute.,Nutritional factors play a big role, he said, with the Japanese diet of fish and vegetables found to foster longevity, just like the vegetable-based Mediterranean diet.,“We’re not certain whether these diets are truly beneficial, but we have no doubt that others, such as French fries, charcuterie and cabbage are not that good,” he said.,
,While good genes play a part, healthy living seems to be fundamental for anybody hoping to grow this old.,“Jeanne Calment ticked all the boxes for longevity, her lifestyle was flawless,” said Catherine Levraud, head of the geriatric ward at Arles hospital. “She started smoking at 25, but just one little cigarillo per day and a small glass of port in the evening. She avoided all excesses.”,Psychological factors, such as people’s general attitude towards life, are also crucial.,“We know that an optimistic outlook has a direct link to the mechanics of the immune system,” said Daniela S. Jopp, a professor for the psychology of aging at Lausanne university in Switzerland.,
,
,In her research into German and American centenarians, she found that they were often extroverts, charismatic, at ease in social situations, passionate about something, goal-oriented and able to find adaptation strategies when dealing with problems.,Perhaps there’s also another factor: Coquettishness.,Hermine Saubion always insists on pretty hairstyles, such as the two little buns she calls her “devil’s horns,” while Aline Blain demands dresses and matching cardigans.,And this is how Sister Andre sums up her formula for successful life: “Find great love and don’t compromise on your needs.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,About a year into the pandemic, Marcela Rafea began waking up consistently at 3 a.m., her mind racing.,She would creep out of bed and tiptoe into the living room, where she would meditate, try a few yoga poses and open the window to hear the leaves rustle, the cars rush by and the dogs bark.,
,Then, at 6 a.m., she crawled back into bed and would sleep again until her youngest child woke her for the day at 7 a.m.,“I needed that night wakefulness to make up for the time that I didn’t have for myself,” said Rafea, a 50-year-old photographer and mother of three who lives in Oak Park, Illinois.,Unbeknown to Rafea, she had naturally reverted back to a sleep cycle that was believed to be standard in multiple cultures in the late Middle Ages through the early 19th century.,During that time, many people went to sleep around sundown and woke three to four hours later. They socialized, read books, had small meals and tried to conceive children for the next hour or two before going back for a second sleep for another three to four hours. It was only when artificial light was introduced that people began forcing themselves to sleep through the night, said A. Roger Ekirch, a professor of history at Virginia Tech and the author of “The Great Sleep Transformation.”,Now that many people are making their own schedules, working from home and focusing more on self-care, there has been a return for some to the idea of a segmented sleep cycle — voluntary and, given the stress levels of the past two years, not.,So are we simply reverting to our long forgotten, natural sleep cycle? And could this be the cure for those deemed middle-of-the-night insomniacs?,Ekirch, who has studied segmented sleep for the past 35 years, said there are more than 2,000 references to it from literary sources: everything from letters to diaries to court records to newspapers, plays, novels and poetry, from Homer to Chaucer to Dickens.,“The phenomenon went by different names in different places: first and second sleep, first nap and dead sleep, evening sleep and morning sleep,” said Benjamin Reiss, a professor of English at Emory University and the author of “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World.” He added that rather than being a choice at the time, this was simply something that people did, as it fit agricultural and artisanal patterns of labor.,Back then, in addition to being a useful time for conceiving, the wakeful period was also believed to be a prime time for taking potions and pills and for aiding digestion (one would sleep on one side of the body during the first sleep, and then on the other side during the second sleep), Ekirch said.,There was no pressure to get to the factory floor on time, to catch a train or to send children off to school, as most work was done in or near the home, Reiss said. Sleep wasn’t governed by the clock, but by the rhythms of night and day as well as by changes in the season.,There were negative reasons for segmented sleep as well.,“Sleeping surfaces — often a sack stuffed with grass, or if you were lucky, wool or horsehair — made it harder than it is today to sleep for a long stretch without interruption,” Reiss said. And there were, of course, health issues. For example, “without modern dentistry, a toothache might start throbbing in the middle of the night.”,Everything changed with the Industrial Revolution, emphasizing profit and productivity; the belief was that people who confined their sleep to a single interval gained an advantage. The growing prevalence of artificial lights permitted later bedtimes, leading to sleep compression.,Fast forward a few hundred years, and we’ve grown accustomed to compressed sleep. Well, some of us have.,Thirty percent of people report waking up at least three nights per week, according to one study published in 2010 in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research, and 25% of adults suffer from insomnia each year, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. For some people, the pandemic has spurred more flexible schedules, which has led to experiments with the old-fashioned sleep method.,That’s the case for Mark Hadley, a 52-year-old finance manager in North Bend, Oregon. In the past 20 years, Hadley said he doesn’t remember a time when he slept completely through the night.,“I always woke up halfway through the night and just lay there,” he said. “Physically, I wanted to get up, but I needed more sleep.”,Hadley didn’t have a choice. He had heard of segmented sleep, but didn’t have time to stretch his own … until his job went mainly remote during the pandemic.,So in August 2021, Hadley started segmented sleeping, going to bed at 10 p.m. and waking up naturally at 2 a.m. He gets up for one and a half to two hours to read and to pray. Then he goes back to bed around 3:30 or 4 a.m. and sleeps until his wife wakes him at 6:30 or 7 a.m.,“This is what my body was trying to do, even when I had never heard of it,” Hadley said. “I finally got to a place where I have a healthy sleep pattern.”,Doctors are conflicted about how healthy segmented sleep is, however.,“We don’t really know the long-term impacts of segmented sleep because we don’t really have much data on it,” said Matthew Ebben, an associate professor of psychology in clinical neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian.,It may make some people feel more fatigued and drowsy throughout the day, said Nicole Avena, a health psychologist and assistant professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Also, Avena said, segmented sleep requires individuals to go to bed earlier, which may not work with many schedules.,That’s why Kristopher Weaver, a 43-year-old songwriter in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, said he manages to stick to a segmented sleep schedule only a few nights a week. The days he does have time to sleep between 7 and 11 p.m. and then again between 3 and 7 a.m., he wakes up refreshed. During his break between first and second sleeps, when his mind is quiet and recharged, Weaver has more energy to write his songs.,The nights that he forces himself to sleep in one go? He needs caffeine and marijuana to get through the next day.,For Danielle Hughes, 33, segmented sleep was a remedy to her insomnia. Hughes, who lives in Dublin, Ireland, spent an entire year visiting with doctors to try to find a solution for her middle-of-the-night awakenings. She finally Googled her issue and stumbled upon segmented sleep.,“It was like a light bulb moment for me,” Hughes said. “The whole anxiety I had about not being able to sleep started to ease, and I started to feel like what little sleep I was getting at night was OK as long as I used my wake time more productively.”,Since she found out about segmented sleep, Hughes has been more open to this concept, sleeping from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. and again from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.,In cases of anxiety around insomnia like Hughes’, segmented sleep is often an ideal solution, said Alex Savy, a sleep science coach and founder of SleepingOcean, a sleep product review site in Toronto.,“When practicing segmented sleep, insomniacs don’t have to worry about waking up in the middle of the night, as that’s the way segmented sleep works,” Savy said. “Therefore, they can adjust the schedule to their insomnia and reduce the stress associated with it.”,But returning to sleep patterns from the Middle Ages isn’t for everyone, Avena said, suggesting that segmented sleep should be tried only by those who are already having sleep issues.,“I think that while it may promote better sleep for these individuals, it probably has more consequences than benefits for those who do not have a hard time sleeping,” she said.,Read more at ,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,To declare any sort of culinary boom is an uncertain, if not futile, task. This is especially true for Japanese cuisine, which has dishes, ingredients and cooking methods that have so seamlessly entered international culinary traditions that Japanese foods are in a state of perpetual “boom” around the world. Ramen, for instance, has been “booming” globally for nearly two decades.,But, at times, there is a trend that deserves the title of “boom” — or at least a mention of its burgeoning popularity on the global stage. And right now, that is ,.,
,Otherwise known as Aspergillus oryzae, kōji is a mold used in culinary traditions in Korea, China and Japan, where it is the fundamental ingredient of such staples as sake, soy sauce and miso. However, as Jeremy Umansky and Rich Shih write in “,,” a book published in May 2020, “Functionally, kōji is not tied to Japanese or any other Asian cuisine that uses it.” And while many chefs outside of Japan have taken to the mystifying or, as Sandor Elliz Katz writes in the book’s forward, “transformative powers” of kōji in previous decades, the product has made an unprecedented leap into home kitchens and menus across the world in recent years.,During the pandemic, ,, including kōji, and a growing community of kōji lovers has begun to take shape. It is centered around ,, a hashtag created by Shih with almost 20,000 posts on Instagram at the time of this article’s publication.,And now, inspired by the hashtag, there is ,. Running through March 6, the Connecticut-based nonprofit The Yellow Farmhouse Education Center will bring kōji experts and enthusiasts together from across the world for two weeks of talks and events to “virtually share their passion for mold-based fermentation.”,In the winter of 2021, the center held the first Kojicon, attended by 700 individuals from 39 countries. This year, in collaboration with the writers of “Koji Alchemy,” the event will bring together speakers such as Sean Doherty, Marika Groen, Bob Florence, Yong Ha and Takashi Sato. They will focus on a range of topics, including creating small batch ferments, implications that fermentation can have on food waste and food pathways, and culinary use of ferments in different cultures.,The popularity of kōji may also be a sign of something else — greater complexity and nuance in the global consumption of Japanese cuisine. It’s no longer ramen and sushi that capture the imagination of foodies, mold is here to stay.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,When it comes time to celebrate a happy event such as a birthday or graduation, home cooks often rely on ,, or scattered-style sushi, to feed the crowd. It’s a particularly popular choice for the Hina Matsuri (Doll Festival), which occurs on March 3, Girls’ Day.,The reason chirashi-zushi is such a good dish for parties is because the amount you make can easily be expanded to accommodate last-minute guests, and three of the major components — soy-simmered shiitake mushrooms, thin omelets and pickled lotus root — can be cooked days in advance. The other components can either be purchased (red and pink pickled ginger, toasted sesame seeds) or made in a matter of minutes (blanched and slivered snow peas).,
,Once the rice and toppings are made, final assembly takes about 30 minutes. Scatter the toppings at random for a quick and attractive presentation, or arrange them in wedges for a more dramatic look. No matter how you design your platter, organizing your menu according to the , of five colors (red, yellow, green, black, white), five flavors (sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter) and five ways (simmer, sear, fry, steam, raw) ensures nutritional balance.,Once assembled, chirashi-zushi keeps well at cool room temperature for hours.,
,What follows are the recipes for all the individual components that will make up the chirashi-zushi. Preparations can be stretched out over several days, or everything can be made at once several days in advance. Simply decide what works best for you and your schedule.,

,Originally, this spring festival was a ritual of purification in preparation for the season’s planting. It was performed on the third day of the third lunar month. Farmers and villagers eager for fertile fields and abundant harvests would make simple paper dolls to which they would “attach” their worries, then float the dolls (and the trouble attached to them) down streams swelling with melting snow.,By the 17th century, the dolls had become so elaborate it seemed a shame to let them float away. The thrifty-minded merchants of old Edo began saving their dolls, displaying them each year in lieu of sending them downstream. There are still a few places in Japan where the custom of , (literally, “float away dolls”) persists.,Rituals connecting fertility of the soil to new life and birth meant the festival was associated with women. Today, the Hina Matsuri (Doll Festival) combines a display of dolls with a gathering to celebrate the health of young girls on March 3.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,The outlets are brightly lit with neon lights and feature the names of famous Osaka tourist sites on the walls and images of the Glico running man and other iconic images of the city on the ceiling.,Inviting aromas waft through the restaurants as staff yell out “,” (thank you), the phrase commonly used to thank customers in the dialect of the Kansai area of western Japan in traditional shops and shopping malls.,Eat & International Co., which handles Osaka Ohsho’s overseas business operations, runs the restaurants in a Shanghai-based joint venture with major Japanese duty-free retailer Laox Co.,Chen Ying, a 35-year-old female customer who dined at one of the new outlets, says, “With the cabbage inside the gyōza, it was sweet with a nice crunch. It tasted great.”,The fried gyōza appeared to be a hit with Chen, although, generally speaking, Chinese consumers prefer the taste of boiled gyōza. She was also impressed with all the playfulness and imagination that went into creating the shop’s decor.,Another 35-year-old woman, who had eaten the pork-bone broth ramen noodles, gave Osaka Ohsho a passing grade. “The flavor of the soup was good,” she says.,Osaka Ohsho operates around 20 overseas restaurants, mainly franchises, in Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Before its latest venture into the Chinese megamarket, it had opened around a dozen outlets there starting in 2012, but was mainly forced to withdraw due to the worsening relations between Japan and China.,Osaka Ohsho’s new strategy is to offer Osaka-specific specialties in addition to Chinese dishes, featuring , (octopus balls) and pot dishes with meat and herbs not served on Japanese menus. About 60% of the menu items, such as takoyaki and okonomiyaki, are specialty dishes from Osaka.,Takada says because Chinese customers tend to have a very keen sense for the saltiness of their food, Osaka Ohsho prepares two kinds of ramen and fried rice — a salty “Osaka flavor” and a lightly seasoned “Shanghai flavor.”,The jumbo gyōza dumplings — a signature dish in Japan — are the hands-down favorite at Shanghai’s first outlet. Six dumplings cost 15 yuan (¥280), or around the same price as in Japan.,Tianjin rice, which is said to have originated in Japan but takes the name of the Chinese city of Tianjin, also whets customers’ appetites and is ordered by many. Okonomiyaki and takoyaki, well-known in China, are also top choices.,Osaka Ohsho had hoped that, on average, each customer would spend around 120 yuan (¥2,200), which is more than in Japan, but most are only willing to fork out about 75 yuan (¥1,370).,Takada says while Osaka Ohsho’s primary target at the outlets, thus far, are young women in their 20s and 30s, it also aims to establish a reputation for being “reliable and tasty” among many Japanese patrons living in the areas.,Because the pandemic has made overseas travel so difficult, there has been a subsequent craving for things Japanese, particularly food, in China, Takada says. According to trade statistics from the Finance Ministry, there was a 41.6% jump in Japanese food exports to China in 2021 compared with the previous year.,“We want to steadily increase the number of shops where people can enjoy the experience of feeling like they have traveled to Osaka,” Takada says.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Noodles fried in lamb fat at the end of , (literally, Ghengis Khan) mutton barbecues are usually considered just a part of the cleanup process. To me, however, they’re the star of the show. And after watching the Oscar-nominated “Drive My Car” recently, I was inspired to make a meal merging Japanese, Chinese and my own Kiwi elements.,
,
,Homemade noodles are daunting, but not that difficult. If you can embrace the idea that inconsistency in width is a good thing, then the pressure is off. Lose yourself in the meditative process. Biang biang hand-pulled noodles from Shanxi are simple and delicious. The word “biang” also shoulders one of the highest stroke counts for a kanji, 56 — twice in a row! I’m not often thankful for katakana, but in this case it’s a godsend.,
,Noodles, then toppings and finally hot fat on top to finish the cooking process right in the serving bowl — what follows is my spin on a classic Xian dish, with Hokkaido lamb and classic herbs to cut the fat. Store-bought noodles work, but you’d be missing out.,

			,Contributing writer,On Miyako Island, the living is easy year-round. With its azure seas, beaches of dazzling white sand and an enviable climate that rarely dips below T-shirt temperature, this mellow, subtropical island in the far southwest of Japan feels like the ultimate get-away destination.,Located almost as close to Taiwan as it is to Okinawa’s main island, it is about as remote as you can get in Japan on a direct flight out of Tokyo. And for most visitors, that is its primary appeal: Once you’ve disembarked and transferred to your luxury resort accommodation, you can switch off and tune out the hassle and stress of life on the mainland.,
,However, at many hotels it’s all too easy to find yourself insulated from the local culture, not least Okinawa’s distinctive culinary traditions. Over the centuries, the island chain, once known as the Ryukyu Kingdom, developed its own cuisine, assimilating influences through a network of trading links with the Asian mainland, Southeast Asia and as far afield as Thailand.,Miyakojima’s main town does have a handful of noodle restaurants and , (taverns) offering typical Okinawan specialties and local cheer from awamori, the potent local distilled spirit widely consumed throughout the islands, to live performances by local musicians. But when it comes to more sophisticated dining, there is only one address to know — that of chef Yasuhiro Tomari and his innovative restaurant, ,.,Born and raised on Miyako, Tomari left for Tokyo at the age of 20 to embark on his career in the kitchen. After training at an Italian restaurant, he changed course under the influence of the French-based Japanese chef Keisuke Matsushima, first in Tokyo and later at his Michelin-starred restaurant in Nice, France.,Following stints in the celebrated restaurants of chef Joel Robuchon and also in France’s Basque country, Tomari decided it was time to return home and set up a restaurant of his own. Feeling it would be too incongruous to serve upmarket French cuisine in the very different setting of Miyako, he began to explore a new approach.,
,
,Drawing on his French training but inspired by the local tradition, he developed a uniquely creative approach to fine dining that he calls modern Ryukyu gastronomy, referencing the name of the former Okinawan kingdom. Almost all his ingredients are sourced from either Miyako or the adjoining Irabu Island, where his restaurant, Etat d’esprit, forms the focal point of the deluxe eight-villa Konpeki resort.,As the evening light drains from the sky over the East China Sea, welcome drinks are served along with a few small finger foods in the guests’ private rooms. But before these, you are invited to try a small aperitif made from mugwort, a bitter herb reputed to stimulate the appetite and impart good health. It is the first of many bold flavors that will be eye-opening for visitors unfamiliar with the foods of subtropical Okinawa.,Once everyone has adjourned to the sleek, discreetly lit dining room of Etat d’esprit, Tomari opens his elaborate eight-course tasting menu with another toast, this time based on the rituals of the ancient Ryukyuan court. Known as ,, the drink takes the form of a thick soup prepared from local Nakajin pork, ginger, , (the lees from brewing sake) and island ,.,These are blended with a broth prepared from irabu sea snake, a traditional delicacy formerly reserved solely for the Okinawan upper classes, which are used to impart flavor, much like the , (bonito flakes) used in soup stock on the Japanese mainland. For extra visual impact, samples of the coiled-up, jet-black sea snakes are brought to the table for you to inspect.,It is the first of many dishes through which Tomari presents the story of Okinawan cuisine. However, rather than looking solely back to the past, he also lets his imagination take flight, imagining how the cuisine of these islands might have developed if Ryukyu had developed as a prosperous nation independent of Japan.,In his hands, , — a pungent form of fermented tofu often considered a rough, acquired taste — is elevated into a delicate appetizer coated with gleaming, ruby-colored cacao butter and presented in a jewel box. Later, this same ingredient reappears as an umami-rich seasoning for “drunken crab,” a take on the more famous Shanghai dish but here using crustaceans caught by local fishermen in the island’s last remaining mangroves.,
,
,Looking to Southeast Asia, he takes inspiration from a street food eaten in the Philippines, where fried chicken feet are known popularly as “adidas.” At Etat d’esprit, this is reinterpreted using squab (young pigeon), and renamed as “hatodas,” a pun on the Japanese name for the bird, ,. Marinated in a blend of soy sauce, vinegar and red pepper, the meat is lightly sprinkled with flour, deep-fried and served with a sweet-savory banana-based sauce.,A gorgeous peacock feather announces a dish that reflects Tomari’s concern for sustainability. Peacocks that have escaped into the wild have proliferated on Miyako’s golf courses and are being culled as an invasive non-native species. Rather than allowing the carcasses to be wasted, he uses their meat and bones to create a light broth in which he serves his refined version of Miyako soba.,For the drink pairing accompanying each dish, the focus stays equally close to home, highlighting the local awamori rather than sake or wine. These exhibit a remarkable range — from frisky, refreshing, low-alcohol types equivalent to fino sherry, to intensely flavorful barrel-aged spirits with the complexity of whisky or dark rum.,The seafood course features fillets of local parrotfish, the iridescent blue reef fish often seen when out diving or snorkeling (for those who may not have done this, an iPhone photo is brought to the table along with your plate). To complement the delicate taste and texture of their flesh, a fin of the same fish is grilled and steeped in a full-octane version of awamori to add a complex, smoky contrast.,Goat has long been the main source of meat on the island, along with pork. As his main course, Tomari prepares it two ways. First, simply grilled over charcoal; but also in a more traditional form, chopped up and cooked with rice. Grilled and served in banana leaves, it is another reminder that Okinawa shares its food traditions with its neighbors to the south as much as it does with Japan.,Culminating with a series of light desserts, perhaps paired with a post-prandial drink or two, it adds up to a superb feast that is not only satisfying and fun but also totally one of a kind. There is nowhere in Okinawa or the rest of Japan offering anything like it.,
,
,For Tomari, his cuisine is both a celebration of his roots and also a call to arms. Intensely concerned about the rapid changes to his homeland, especially since the advent of rampant overtourism, he sees it as his contribution to preserving the fragile local environment. It is also his way of drawing attention to the culture of the Ryukyus, which now, more than ever, is at grave risk of being lost.,Currently, however, it is a message that is only reaching the exclusive few who dine at Etat d’esprit. All the tables are reserved solely for guests staying in the hotel’s eight plush villas, and cannot be reserved separately.,Azure The Villa All-Suite, Ikemasoe 1195-1, Irabu-ji, Miyakojima-shi, Okinawa Pref. 906-0502; 0980-78-6000; ,.

				,
			,Contributing writer,When Masachika Nakato and his partner, Mika, began selling their craft beer at the weekly , farmers market, little did they know it was the first big step in realizing their dream of a true local brew.,The couple founded their craft beer brewery , in 2015 when the idea of craft beer was still a relatively new concept in Kobe. They were on the lookout for new opportunities to showcase their work when a customer mentioned that they should check out the market. The two went for a visit. They liked the laid-back vibe and the philosophy — all Kobe, all the time — and soon had a stall of their own. Not only did they find more customers, but they started meeting farmers and fellow producers.,
,“We had no idea so many farms existed in Kobe,” Mika says. “Our first reaction was, ‘Wow! They’re just like us,’ trying to create something that could only be made here.”,One of those was Shinji Inada of Inada Bee Garden, located in northern Kobe. Set up in the stall next to In Tha Door Brewing one Saturday morning, the two vendors chatted, and the conversation eventually turned to how they might work together. The resulting brew, Inada Honey Saison, soon followed. Looking back, the Nakatos peg this as the first in what would become the ,.,“We’d never done anything like that before but it was really inspiring,” says head brewer Masachika. “We realized we wanted to do more collaborations like that.”,
,
,Since that first delicious experiment, In Tha Door Brewing has partnered with upward of 17 growers and producers for beers that incorporate things like bread, mint, tomatoes and black beans among others. In return, the brewery shares some of the beer as well as spent grains with farmers for use on their fields. The Nakatos see it as a way to forward their dream of creating a distinctly Kobe beer that also supports their fellow producers.,“Farmers have so much delicious produce, but they often have small amounts because they are small operations like us,” says Mika. “It can be hard to find a buyer for these amounts or if the produce is B-grade and unsellable. For us none of that is a problem, and we help each other. It’s a new beer for us and a way for them to sell their produce. Also,” Mika adds with a laugh, “many of them like beer, so we get to drink it together.”,In Tha Door’s brews are also distinct for their use of Kobe groundwater, usually considered the purview of sake brewers. And as word spread about their endeavors to partner with local growers and producers, they were approached by area restaurants and shops interested in offering their beer.,Momentum was building around the brewery and these collaborations, but it wasn’t until 2018 when the Nakatos decided it needed something more formal. They began to work with a local organic barley farmer to make the malt for some small batch beers, and they dubbed their efforts the Kobe Local Beer Project.,“‘Project’ sounds really formal,” says Mika, “but it helps people understand what we are doing. For us, it’s very informal, something we just want to enjoy, something we like doing.”,Another grower, Shoko Morimoto, started growing hops in 2017 when the Nakatos visited her vegetable farm after meeting her at the market. Set high on Mount Rokko, part of the range of mountains that forms a steep backdrop to Kobe, Morimoto’s farm is only a 30-minute drive from the city center but feels a world away. Colder year round and less humid, it is ideal for growing hop bines, which prefer a more temperate climate than that afforded to farms lower down. Last year, Morimoto grew 45 kilograms for the beer project and plans to increase that amount this year with the help of other members of her village.,“There are many empty fields there, and people are happy to see them used and help when they can,” says Morimoto. “Other farmers often offer me the use of the land they don’t use, and because hops like a lot of room, it works well.”,
,
,The Nakatos brew upward of 9,000 liters of beer a year with roughly 2,000 to 3,000 liters of that for the Kobe Local Beer Project. While it may seem like a drop in the beer barrel, such partnerships are part of what the founders of Eat Local Kobe had in mind when they started the market eight years ago. These kinds of ventures keep local farmland in production, increase regional food self-sufficiency, and create local jobs. According to Takako Ohyama, CEO at circular design company fog, inc. and founder of ,, a circular economy model hub in Tokyo, collaborations like Kobe Local Beer Project make for a diversified and strong local economy.,“If we cooperate and form groups,” says Ohyama, “we can create an economy that can be sustained. It in turn creates a strong tie to the place and each other, so together we work to make this place, our community, better and more sustainable economically and environmentally.”,Studies have also found that beer, consumed in moderation, can play a pivotal role in community and economic development. , found that one job in a brewery created 16 outside jobs in everything from agriculture to supply chains to serving the beer to thirsty patrons.,For the Nakatos, though, the project isn’t about making money. Their objective is to foster community and create a way of life truly rooted in “local” that they can enjoy with their neighbors.,“There is only one taste like this in the world,” says Mika. “It’s good to have a local taste, to work face-to-face, and to know the people we work with in our community. It’s also really fun.”,For more information, visit , and the Kobe Local Beer Project.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,By the most recent statistics — as well as by an overwhelming evidence of lived experience — landlords refuse non-Japanese renters in large numbers.,
,These prospective tenants are thus subject to a longer, more exhausting and potentially much more expensive rental application process. A 2016 government survey showed that a massive 40% of respondents had been rejected for rental housing because they were not Japanese. According to the Ichii Group real estate agency, almost nine out of 10 private housing units in Tokyo do not allow foreign tenants. So why is housing discrimination in Japan so widespread? And has the situation improved at all in the past few years?,
,First, it’s important to dig into why housing discrimination is such a problem in Japan. The basis lies in Japan’s powerful laws that protect renters against eviction, known as “right of residence.”,“Abroad, renting is quite easy. You can move out easily, and owners can ask you to leave easily,” says Alex Toyoda of Tokyo-based real estate company ,. “But in Japan, the tenant is very strongly protected by the law.” Justifiable cause to evict tenants are limited to very special exceptions, such as if the owner goes bankrupt and has nowhere but that apartment for them to live. “For this reason, the screening process is extremely strict,” Toyoda adds.,The screening process sets out to examine a prospective renter’s identification, proof of income, employment and more. Japanese landlords tend to have two major concerns with non-Japanese renters. The first is that they will leave Japan unexpectedly and stop paying rent. The other is communication issues because most landlords cannot speak English for management purposes.,“Most companies are OK with us being the middle-man as an English-speaking real estate agency,” says Toyoda. “When the company says ‘no foreigners,’ it’s normally because they cannot speak English.”,Adam German at ,, an online guide to Japanese real estate, says that oftentimes, the fault lies with the Japanese agent, who gives up when property managers express that a non-Japanese renter could be a problem.,“Most Japanese leasing agents open the door in their initial contact for the property manager to refuse the viewing, telling the foreign person that they likely will not rent to foreigners when in reality, the only thing that the property manages really cares about was whether the foreign client could understand at least a little Japanese or not,” German says. “I have found in my career that this is an overblown topic.”,Real estate agents say potential ways of overcoming these problems include paying a year of rent up front or making the contract period shorter.,
,
,The 2016 survey revealed a number of , about housing discrimination in Japan. More than 90% of people in the survey who reported that they were rejected from rental housing because they were foreign nationals could speak Japanese at either a native (24%), professional (36%) or conversational level (31%). According to these results, language ability did not correlate with whether people were being rejected for housing.,Many rejected foreign residents interviewed for a , even had a Japanese spouse, a Japanese parent or fluency in Japanese. Industry insiders point out that stories of bad experiences with non-Japanese tenants, while uncommon in reality, spread widely among landlords.,A potential reason for the clash between real estate perspectives and the survey results lie in demographics. English-speaking real estate agents tend to work with Western clients, whereas many of the nationalities that reported the highest levels of discrimination were Asian: Thirty-eight percent of Chinese respondents and 40% of Thai respondents reported discrimination, versus just 24% of those from the United States and 18% of those from the United Kingdom.,As one ethnic Korean woman said in her survey response: “Even though I was born and raised in Japan, I can’t rent an apartment in this country because of my nationality. I was born and raised in Japan and I can’t speak any language other than Japanese, but I still experience a lot of discrimination and prejudice here.”,So while English-language ability may be the primary issue for Westerners trying to rent, overt or implicit racism may come into play with Asian groups. ,, an American looking for an apartment with his Vietnamese partner recalled having been told through a real estate agent: “The American is OK, but we won’t accept a Vietnamese.”,The survey also revealed that people who lived in Japan for more than 10 years were rejected at similar rates as those who had been in Japan for a short amount of time. So even living in Japan for a long period of time didn’t make non-Japanese residents less likely to experience discrimination.,Finally, the survey shows that large numbers of non-Japanese residents could not easily find rental housing because they did not have a Japanese guarantor, who promises to cover any rent or damage costs in case a foreign resident leaves the country.,
,Concerns over housing discrimination have risen in recent years in response to an uptick in the number of foreign workers in Japan prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Japan’s , in 2019 represented nearly 50% growth over 2012.) Accordingly, housing discrimination has received more attention among the growing number of foreign residents attempting to make Japan a home.,Private industry in Japan has voiced anxiety over housing discrimination because it can negatively affect the ability to attract and retain talent. Tsuyoshi Yamada, a human resources manager at Total OA Systems, , that a lack of sufficient housing support for non-Japanese employees could throw a hurdle up in front of the company’s plan to bring in overseas talent, for example.,The fundamental reality of the law and the mindset of landlords has barely budged. However, more private companies have started offering services in response to these trends.,One major development has been the rise of guarantor companies, emerging in response to the problem of foreigners’ applications being rejected due to a lack of Japanese guarantor. Many employers and schools will offer to serve as guarantor for their employees and students, but if this is not possible, guarantor companies have become a viable option. Companies such as , and , specialize in guarantor insurance for foreign renters. The cost is typically around half a month’s rent plus an annual renewal fee of ¥10,000.,Real estate agencies that specialize in renting to non-Japanese individuals, such as ,, , and ,, have also grown in recent years. These agencies tend to know which landlords do and do not accept non-Japanese tenants, so working directly with them can save apartment hunters precious time and frustration. Shared houses also do not require guarantors, and offer significant cost savings in exchange for sharing common areas with other residents.,“I feel like the Japanese government is enthusiastic to bring in new foreigners to work, but is not really thinking about the infrastructure, and this is one of those issues,” says Rochelle Kopp, a consultant at Japan Intercultural and occasional Japan Times contributor.,Concerns over communication, outright discrimination and non-persistent agents have combined to make Japan a treacherous renting environment for non-Japanese.,However, renters can try to be smart in their applications by highlighting their job security, nationality or Japanese fluency. Ultimately, foreign nationals will still be at the mercy of landlords and better off using specialist real estate agencies.,While laws won’t be changing in the near future, more awareness and industry response have created additional tools for foreign residents to navigate these unforgiving waters.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,If you want to learn about perseverance — about sticking doggedly to a task despite the difficulties, and patiently bearing discomfort to achieve a wider goal — then Japan is the place for you.,I used to work alongside a French-language teacher in Kobe. The reason he came to Japan was his love of martial arts, and his desire to attend a dojo here. He found one with a reputable teacher and popped in on his day off to ask about starting lessons. He was told that the teacher was unavailable, but was invited to wait for him. Two hours passed and the teacher did not appear. The would-be student again asked if he could see the teacher, and was again asked to wait. A further two hours passed. Eventually, the teacher appeared, congratulated my colleague on passing the test of his resolve, and accepted him as a student.,
,If taken at face value, this is a good illustration of the importance traditionally attached in Japan to perseverance. A proverb neatly encapsulates the thought: 石の上にも三年 (,). This literally translates as, “Three years upon the rock.” Have you been working at that good-for-nothing company for a year now and are sick of it? Well, tough luck. This proverb implores you to stick at it for another two years. The uncomfortable rock beneath you might finally start to soften.,This is no philosophy for snowflakes, but perhaps it is an appropriate one for the present. It has been around 18 months since the first state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic was announced in Japan, and there have been on-and-off restrictions ever since. For those living in the compact urban apartments so common here, it may feel more like a year-and-a-half under the rock, rather than three years on it. With vaccinations reaching more and more arms, though, isn’t it time to receive some reward for all of our patience?,I am 40 years old, with a checkered history of medical complaints, and I finally got my second dose of vaccine last month. One part of my brain keeps trying to remind me that I live in a wonderfully odd and vibrant part of the world, and that I used to go to live music venues, night spots and karaoke bars, and it’s urging me to start socializing again.,On the other hand, practical difficulties and ongoing restrictions are trying to tell me the opposite. My 5-year-old son’s nursery is currently closed, for example, because one of the children tested positive for COVID-19. And 18 months of self-restraint is habit-forming. I’ve become as predictable in my routine as an old man. I remember my grandfather eating regularly in the same cafe, ordering the same bacon roll, and drinking the same brand of gin. “Ah, that’s old age,” I thought. Now, I drink coffee between the same perspex partitions in my local coffee shop, and order food from the same window seat at a quiet local restaurant. Impulsive day trips, crowded festivals and randomly accepting invitations to meet up all seem like a part of my youth.,“Three years upon the rock” can be turned on its head, however. The three years could be interpreted as an upper limit rather than a lower one. If you have been sitting on a rock for as long as three years, and it still hasn’t gotten comfy, then you’d better get up! Perseverance has its limits. Personally, I always wondered whether that martial arts teacher who taught my French colleague that valuable lesson was not, in fact, simply a little scatterbrained. Maybe he’d actually forgotten about his potential customer and was just good at thinking on his feet?,In short, without being complacent about new variants and ongoing restrictions, now that I’ve had my second vaccine dose, I am going to make an effort to enjoy the charms of Tokyo a little more, lest I age myself prematurely. There’s no turning back the clock. The city has changed, and compromises are necessary. When I recently stretched my legs and ate out at a nice restaurant a couple of train rides away from my regular haunts, they served me my coffee before the meal as a clear signal to eat quickly and leave without dawdling. But the chatter, camaraderie and loud “,” welcomes put a spring in my step. It’s not healthy to live under a rock for too long.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,A friend of mine once happened upon a former Japanese prime minister. This English teacher was sitting on a riverside bench in Kyoto when Junichiro Koizumi came strolling past, accompanied by two security guards. The former prime minister (in office from April 2001 to September 2006) was immediately recognizable from his wavy, Richard Gere-esque hairstyle.,Koizumi is one of the few Japanese prime ministers to become easily recognizable to people outside of Japan. He played catchball with George W. Bush, and did an Elvis impersonation in Graceland. At home, he courted controversy by sending Japanese Self Defence Forces to Iraq, privatizing the postal service and regularly visiting Yasukuni Shrine.,
,Part of the reason Koizumi was so recognizable may have been because of the length of his time in office. It is hard to be colorful or make a mark outside Japan if you aren’t in office for long, and that has tended to be the case with many Japanese prime ministers. The recently departed Yoshihide Suga, for instance, lasted just over a year (September 2020 to October 2021). And before Shinzo Abe took power in 2012, there were six prime ministers in six years — all men of a certain age.,Most people would recognize Angela Merkel, given her long stint in power, but it is rarely worth the effort of trying to remember the latest, brief incarnation of the Japanese leader. Perhaps new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will buck the trend.,For my English teacher friend who got unexpectedly close to Koizumi, it was like taking a drug and experiencing a fleeting high.,“I felt suddenly powerful,” he told me. “I wanted to run over and say something to him. Maybe if I could say the right thing, I could influence world events. Or at least I could make the news.”,It’s a nice thought. “Don’t do it that way, Mr. Prime Minister! You’ll never make it if you do it that way!”,Given that voting, even in local elections, is restricted to Japanese nationals, it would be arguably more understandable for a foreign resident of Japan to heckle politicians than for Japanese nationals to do so. I mean, how else can we get our concerns across?,“Mr. Prime Minister? Mr. Prime Minister! Can you change the day my burnable garbage is collected? I like to lie in on Saturdays. … Don’t look at me like that. I’d express my opinions on local politics through elections if I were allowed to vote.”,There was another English teacher who, unlike my friend, seized the moment to express an opinion on Japanese politics when the chance presented itself.,In April 2011, , that a teacher by the name of Edward Jones, then 34, interrupted a Japanese politician’s public speech. He reportedly grabbed the microphone while the candidate was speaking in public in Tokorozawa, Saitama. The Briton then shouted his own political message to stunned observers.,Jones was arrested, since it is a criminal offense in Japan to obstruct the election process — including through interference with political candidates’ speeches and defacing political posters. Those convicted can be heavily fined or even imprisoned.,So what was the defiant message my fellow Briton shouted into the microphone? Was this a suffragette moment for Japan’s foreign residents? Did a brave soul do the equivalent of throwing himself under the king’s horse, demanding voting rights for permanent foreign residents?,Jones reportedly grabbed the microphone and shouted, “Japanese elections are noisy!”,Well, at least he made the news.,I don’t condone Jones’ actions, but in some ways I can’t help but sympathize with this non-Japanese resident of Japan. If you cannot vote, then elections are just loud noise and color. And, actually, there’s not even that much color.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The first thing I noticed was a heavy feeling.,It was a Friday. I tried to convince myself it was something else, maybe unusually high levels of pollution or the result of living in an air-conditioned box all summer, but fear of what it might be lingered in the back of my mind.,
,I called a COVID-19 helpline the next day. They asked about my symptoms; had I been vaccinated? My ward had only just opened vaccinations for my age group and I was due to get my first dose that week. The operator offered the number of a doctor 30 minutes away and then, without any further information, the call ended.,My health got worse as the weekend continued. Normal tasks became mammoth undertakings and my heart seemed to beat faster. Breathing was definitely harder and, to top it all off, I lost my sense of smell and taste. I was certain I had COVID.,After hearing about it for over a year — the constant news, the casecount, millions of lives lost, vaccination concerns — to know that I had the very thing that had caused the world to shut down was frightening and frustrating. I had been patiently waiting for the vaccine only to be struck down just as I was eligible to get the jab. I’d been following the news in Japan — the lack of hospital beds, people being turned away from hospitals — so I was terrified of things taking a turn for the worse. I felt cut off from all help.,Confused about what next steps should be, I called yet another hotline. I explained my symptoms to the operator.,“Have you been in contact with anybody from abroad?” she asked. I hadn’t. “Where do you think you may have picked the virus up?” This was a harder question to answer. I’d been following all the rules on masking and social distancing. Perhaps, I got it in an elevator?,The operator asked me what I wanted to do, so I told her I wanted a COVID test. She said my options were to either visit a doctor who would determine if I needed a test; or I could pay upwards of ¥20,000 for a test from a predetermined list of companies. I was told to think about it.,I began weighing my options. The test was ultimately pointless if the aim was to determine if I had COVID-19. I wanted my case to be counted in the daily statistics so that, perhaps, the government would have a proper idea of the extent of the pandemic in Japan.,However, getting the test would mean I’d have to take a taxi to a doctor’s office. Would I have to sit in a waiting room? I just had no idea of how many people I could potentially expose to the virus along the way. No, I couldn’t help but think that leaving my apartment would be the wrong thing to do (though I found out later that I would’ve at least been greeted with strict distancing protocols at the doctor’s office). The operators on the hotlines also didn’t seem too concerned with me getting tested, probably because they also knew I had it by hearing the symptoms. We’re not doctors but I think a lot of us have become better at telling the difference between COVID-19 and the flu. So, I became one of what could be several, many or only a couple of undocumented cases of COVID-19 in Japan, but I can’t know for sure.,
,
,In the moment, I didn’t care. I was tired, my whole body ached; I needed constant rest, but I couldn’t sleep. I could barely walk from one end of the room to the other without feeling exhausted. Even my teeth hurt. Dark thoughts infected my mind, too. I thought about people who died from COVID-19, what they must have been going through. Would I go through the same thing?,A call to my family back home in England eased my fast-growing fears. My friends in Japan also came through for me, messaging support, checking in and offering to bring food over. It made a big difference: I wasn’t so alone after all.,One afternoon, a week into the illness, I found a bag hanging on my front door. Inside was artisan bread, chocolate, cheese, soup sachets and a printed-off sheet with English information about where to get help for COVID-19. The food was a welcome change from the canned stuff I’d been storing in case of an earthquake. I had no idea who had left the package, none of my friends had done it, so I left a note on my door that read, “Thank you for your kindness.”,The next day, a reply was stuck to my neighbor’s door. She must have heard me through the apartment walls coughing, or maybe talking on the phone to my family about having the virus? Up till then I only really offered the briefest of nods and simplest greetings when walking past my neighbors, so this care package was quite a surprise.,This show of support really boosted my spirits. It helped bring me back to the outside world, after feeling so isolated within the four walls of my apartment. I had a renewed sense of wanting to beat this thing and started researching how other people handled their COVID experiences.,I started doing deep-breathing exercises before bed in order to curb the shortness of breath; hot showers to ease my airways; regular doses of Eve A, a brand of Japanese pain reliever; drank gallons of water; and ate copious amounts of sweets because I started to be able to taste them slightly.,
,
,Ten days after first feeling sick, I actually began to feel normal again. I had the energy to sweep the floor and wash up. I took slow walks, a little further every day, elated that I could make it to my local park. However, getting back to my pre-COVID routine took about one month. My sense of smell isn’t entirely 100% yet, still, “normal” has never felt so good.,The whole experience kind of gets to what it’s like to live as a non-Japanese resident of Japan, though everyone’s situations are different. The hotlines, the hospitals — it’s all very structured and hard to access, especially when you’re not at your best. There are so many people in Tokyo that don’t have the same kinds of support networks, easy access to testing or even access to simple advice.,As frustrating as all that was, in the end it was a Japanese neighbor’s act of kindness that brought me back from spiraling into dark thoughts and prompted me to start fighting back against the virus. If I’ve learned anything from this, it’s to be nice to your neighbors.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Wakayama Prefecture doesn’t just feel like a spiritual place, it is spiritual. On its northern borders are holy sites such as the Ise Grand Shrine in Mie Prefecture and Todaiji Temple in Nara Prefecture, which houses Japan’s largest Buddha statue. However, as you travel deeper into Wakayama itself, both the awesome natural surroundings and the proliferation of historic religious sites can provide a sense of spirituality to a lone traveler like myself.,Vast swaths of forested mountains stretch out across sparsely populated territory, from Mount Gomadan on the border with Nara to Asaki Shrine, which is situated on the southernmost tip of Honshu. In between, ancient shrines dot the lush, mountainous region, honoring the local gods of mountain, forest and sea, and Buddhist temples welcome those seeking enlightenment.,
,In Shingon Buddhism, headquartered at Kongobuji temple on Mount Koya, enlightenment is not a distant dream that takes many lifetimes to attain, but a real possibility for all of us in this world. The combination of breathtaking scenery, remoteness and dedicated spiritual practice makes Wakayama a truly spiritual place in Japan — one quite unlike any I have experienced abroad.,In fact, the presence of spiritual landscapes such as Wakayama is one of my favorite things about living in Japan. People frequently discuss the pros and cons of life in Japan to outsiders. The first positives to get mentioned are the trains, the food and the hustle and bustle of Shibuya. But what people rarely mention is the ubiquitous presence of a “spiritual geography” that covers the landscape: the temples and shrines that mark every mountain and fit into every neighborhood.,“I believe (temples and shrines) play a role in modern society as a place where people can discover ‘something’ about themselves,” says Yusen Onozaki, a former chief Buddhist priest and current owner of Nyojitsu-an, a Buddhist hermitage near Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture. “When you enter the precincts of a temple or shrine, it gives rise to feelings that you do not normally experience.,“I heard an anecdote from a young nursery school student that most children spend their lunch breaks not in the school cafeteria, but in the neighborhood shrine. Religious facilities of all kinds create a calm and extraordinary atmosphere that makes you feel as if you’ve ‘come home’ … a place for your soul to come home.”,I grew up Jewish in a suburb of Philadelphia, but relatively isolated from other Jews. There were churches around, but I never entered them. Why would I? I never woke up to the call to prayer that is common in Islamic countries, or witnessed the world completely tune out on Friday afternoon for Shabbat as in Israel. While very few Japanese are devout Buddhists or “Shintoists,” the persistence of spirituality in the landscape around me in Japan has become meaningful in ways that I never expected.,Shinto and Buddhist buildings, ruins and ritual throughout Japan can help fuel relationships with your spirituality regardless of faith and background. For me, Japan’s spiritual geography has prompted a deeper connection with nature, a more sophisticated appreciation of art and aesthetics, and a renewed dialogue with my own faith.,
,Even if Shinto and Buddhist practice were to die out entirely, there’s much to be gained from the mere presence of these monuments in the urban and natural landscape. Temples, shrines and small but meaningful symbols — a miniature , shrine on a mountainside, or a straw cord around a tree — act as ways to commemorate and exalt the natural world.,
,
,A Shinto shrine’s basic function is to serve as a house of residence for spirits. From that perspective, engaging with shrines is like going to an art museum for nature. Most often, a shrine is dedicated to a local nature deity, and requires a small trek up a hill or into a secluded grove of trees. Engaging with a shrine means interacting with and opening yourself up to the local landscape, whether it’s a spectacular seaside cliff or a hidden grove in the suburbs.,The enshrinement of local nature also makes said nature more valuable. You don’t need to believe in the spirits to understand the value of locating the sacred in the natural world. The deification of local mountains, forests and oceans is just as relevant to an atheist, so long as the atheist is keenly aware of human society’s relentless exploitation and destruction of the natural world around us.,I often visit the ancient cypress tree at Atsuta Shrine in central Nagoya. Seeing the tree in itself is magnificent. But its location within a shrine — and the reminder that, while the tree is natural, it only survives due to dozens and dozens of generations making intentional decisions to preserve it over a thousand years — marks its ascendance into the sacred. The heart of Nagoya is a developed, industrial place with a relentless eye on production and profit. The spiritual task of preserving this tree through all of the wars and development is profound. It matters, regardless of whether or not I believe in the local deities.,Temples and shrines have also inspired me to develop a finer appreciation of art, aesthetics, and philosophy. Each local shrine and temple has a unique history and mythology. These stories form a network of texts and art objects to engage with. Like any work of art, they can fuel new insight, appreciation and creativity. The omnipresence of temples and shrines throughout Japan means that art objects and historical artifacts are often a stone’s throw away, and not locked inside distant museums or private collections. Even the seemingly ordinary statues of bodhisattvas are carefully crafted works of art.,Onozaki adds that another layer of this experience worthwhile to an outsider is the changing qualities of architecture and nature of religion across time. By traveling to various sites around Japan, a visitor will see just how drastically the florid Zuihoden Mausoleum in Sendai differs from the rustic, ancient Izumo Grand Shrine in Shimane. These divergent forms offer a greater variety of art and history to appreciate, and provide a lens into the way that spirituality in Japan adapted to new times.,All of this is hardly to mention morality. Onozaki believes that the greatest role Buddhism can play in modern Japan is by advocating open-mindedness.,“Japanese Buddhism has a basic attitude of forgiveness, compassion and mercy,” Onozaki says. This tolerance lies at the heart of spirituality in Japan, where people do not strictly follow one religion but freely drift among religious beliefs, practices, and faiths. Onozaki says that open-mindedness is especially needed in a digital age in which we are often so quick to criticize and dismiss others.,
,
,Japan’s spiritual geography has refined my relationship with my own faith. Temples and shrines have taken my own dialogue with Judaism in new directions.,For one, the network of texts, rituals and deities at these monuments contrasts with my own religious background. The practice of private prayer at Shinto shrines, or meditation at Buddhist temples, is a world apart from the communal Jewish prayers and songs I grew up with. But, as with any act of cultural exchange, interacting with these unique customs helps me grow. Without easy access to a Jewish community in Nagoya, I’ve developed new spiritual practice due to the presence of the temples and shrines. For example, a visit to a temple when traveling has become my time for religious study and reflection.,I’ve even come to celebrate the Jewish New Year with a mountain climb and a shrine visit. The muscle pain, accompanied by sweeping views of the landscape and the jangle of temple bells, feels strangely similar to hearing the call of the Shofar in synagogue after minutes of suspended, silent prayer.,Onozaki advises foreign residents in Japan to open their arms to temples and shrines, not for the sake of tourism but instead as a personal act of spirituality. Preparing and eating traditional vegetarian food in a temple, for example, or practicing , meditation, are unique experiences felt with all five of the senses. They can lead to new forms of spirituality and morality when taken on with genuine enthusiasm.,I could not be more grateful for the abundant spiritual sites throughout the Japanese landscape. Above all, it’s remarkable how open they are. Even outsiders can take advantage of their architecture, their natural beauty and their spiritual depths.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,After a year filled with ups and downs, Joan Bailey isn’t quite where she wants to be for the holidays.,“I had hoped that my partner or I could return home to see our families, but it all feels precarious and unpredictable. … A big part of my heart and head is at home or wants to be at home to celebrate,” says Bailey, a university instructor and writer (and occasional contributor to The Japan Times).,
,“The unpredictability of (it) all has been hard,” she continues. “If we go, can we get back? Can we even safely celebrate here in Japan with friends?”,All the usual stress around holiday travel is once again being aggravated by the unprecedented challenges brought on by COVID-19.,Albert Siegel finds himself in a similar situation. A photographer in Tokyo, this year he’s been hit with a loss of work, major disruptions to his routine and worry over risks COVID-19 poses to his young children. He and his wife are both vaccinated, but his children are not. He also describes a sense of pandemic-related isolation, and only recently visited his in-laws for the first time in more than two years.,“The youngest boy, he just turned 3 in October,” he says. “And the last time the grandparents saw him, he was just born. So all this has been kind of stressful because it’s so out of the ordinary for everybody.”,Bailey’s and Siegel’s concerns are familiar to many in the international community as we entertain a complicated calculus that includes the virus, travel restrictions, work visas, financial concerns and our own stress and anxiety levels. For many, this mix has meant that holiday travel is simply not feasible — again — this year. That can be frustrating and disappointing, but in some cases it can also be a relief.,Yoon Ki Chai, a licensed marriage and family therapist in California and psychotherapist at TELL, a mental health and suicide prevention nonprofit in Japan, says these themes have been coming up a lot with her clients. In the face of complex emotions, “One kind of basic thing you can do is just naming and acknowledging what you’re feeling,” she says. “Your emotions, both the pleasant ones and maybe the unpleasant ones.”,“It’s working on acceptance, but it’s also about control because if you can identify what you’re feeling and name it, you have more control over it, because you know what it is and then you can take that next step,” Chai continues, adding that you can start to put coping strategies in place, such as breathing exercises or journaling, or even making a playlist for different emotions.,Art is another way to process your feelings. “Even just reconnecting with things that maybe you would see as being more for kids can be really, really helpful because it brings back just that sense of kind of playfulness that I think can be really nourishing,” Chai says.,For her part, Bailey says she has decided to focus on getting outside more, especially since winter is her favorite season, and to start projects that are helpful to others.,“For example, I’m planning to make some favorite holiday foods and figuring out how to contribute to places or organizations in my hometown that help others,” Bailey says. “I think it can help to not just focus inward so much, but also look outward.”,In the field of therapy there’s a concept known as “radical acceptance.” This is when a person fully accepts what life is throwing at them, including things that are out of their control. The acceptance comes as you stop fighting reality and let go of any bitter feelings. It doesn’t, however, mean you agree with things, you just simply acknowledge them as real.,“You know, none of us can control the situation,” Siegel says. “And I think that when we begin to accept that some things are to a degree, or maybe even totally, out of our control, we just accept that sometimes things are what they are and just learn to deal with it.”,Bailey is working on maintaining connections, even if she can’t be with certain loved ones physically.,“I talk to my mom each week, but I’ve been calling her a bit more of late just to randomly check in,” she says. “I will also say that everyone is getting a few more presents than usual. A different kind of shopping therapy, I guess. I’m trying not to take anything or anyone for granted here or at home.”,In addition to reaching out to people, Chai recommends planning things that are nurturing for yourself, too.,“Sometimes it’s hard for people to think about themselves, but imagine that you’re creating a special day for someone else,” she says. “What would you do, what would you plan? And then see if you can do that for yourself.” This might include creating a personal, meaningful ritual, honoring something that’s important to you.,But Chai says not to put too much pressure on yourself. It has been a hard couple of years. “Be a good friend to yourself, and try to put aside unhelpful expectations and just appreciate or enjoy the things that you’ve planned for yourself.”, ,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,It’s a perennial New Year’s resolution: Hit the books and start improving your Japanese. There’s a reason it keeps popping up on your list, learning the language is important.,For example, if you hope to change careers in 2022 — or get further in the one you already have — improving your vocabulary is key. In fact, that’s my resolution for the year and I want to share my own plan here in case it serves as a helpful reference to anyone else with the same objective.,
,Improving your vocabulary also helps with getting the most out of life outside of the workplace, which could be another resolution for 2022, and should in turn reduce any stress and frustration you may feel living as a non-Japanese resident in this country.,Although I passed Level N1 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test in my 20s and have been using the language professionally since then, there are still a lot of gaps in my knowledge when it comes to vocabulary. In fact, until I returned here in 2019 to live and work full time, my use of Japanese was mostly confined to areas connected with my work. As a result, I know all sorts of specialized words related to my profession but not so many outside of that. I also developed a lot of bad habits such as skimming over words I don’t know, learning the meaning of a word but not its pronunciation, and even making up my own incorrect pronunciations.,Over the past year I have experimented with a variety of different techniques and apps for improving my vocabulary. Rather than settling on just one, I’ve come up with a combination — kind of like how an athlete might lift weights one day, do some yoga the next and high-intensity interval training the day after that. What follows is the regimen that I’ve put together.,
,This was the technique I used back in my 20s, when I got a job at a Japanese bank and had to learn the vocabulary associated with the financial world very quickly. Basically, every time you encounter a new word you should look it up and write it down in a notebook. Then, review the list frequently and make paper flashcards with them. You can get cards on a ring holder designed for this purpose at a 100 yen shop or stationery store.,This method still works, but it feels out of step with the main way that I consume Japanese-language content now, which is on my computer or with my iPad. It also doesn’t take advantage of spaced repetition, a technique for promoting memorization based on seeing the word at precise intervals. This kind of system works best when it’s automated, and it’s a standard feature in most vocabulary-learning apps these days (including the ones listed below). I still keep a vocabulary notebook and pen nearby, however, primarily for recording words I encounter when reading PDFs or books.,
,
,Knowing that I needed to start looking up and learning the words that appear in what I read online, I installed the ,. Now, when I highlight a word on my screen while pressing the shift key, a window pops up that shows its pronunciation and definition.,Yomichan can be connected to the , memorization app, enabling you to put words you have looked up with Yomichan into an Anki flashcard deck in just one click. Getting these two programs working with each other properly was tricky, but once it’s set up it works well. I also grabbed several of the public decks on Anki, including a couple focusing on , (four-kanji idioms), which I have been wanting to learn more of. To similarly check definitions of words and quickly add them to a study list while using my iPad rather than my PC, I got a dictionary app called Japanese, which is made by the firm Renzo.,
,After using the techniques above, I discovered a new problem: I find typical flashcards boring and have to force myself to use them. To deal with this, I returned to using an app I first started using a decade ago, ,. Rather than flipping a card, you are asked to answer multiple choice questions, or type the word in yourself. Not only is this more interesting, it forces you to be more active and thus learn the words better. I also find I can use it for a longer period of time without getting bored. Another thing I like about iKnow! is that the company behind it invested in excellent voice actors who read the words and example sentences with some much-appreciated flair.,
,Although the apps mentioned above are helpful, I started to feel that I would make more progress if I learned words in context, so I decided to try ,. This app has a variety of custom written stories, each with an audio track, and shows definitions and detailed grammatical explanations when you click on a word. Although it’s aimed at the intermediate level, I find plenty of unfamiliar words, which I can add to Satori Reader’s in-app vocabulary list for study. The stories are very well written; I recently stayed up past 1 a.m. to get to the end of a particularly suspenseful one.,
,Similar to Satori Reader, , has a variety of content to read along with a built-in dictionary. And it enables you to make a vocabulary list to study. While LingQ lacks the detailed explanations and hand-crafted feel of Satori Reader, it has two features that I find particularly helpful: The first is the ability to import material from elsewhere — either with a URL or by pasting text — that then becomes a new lesson, and the second is its one-click function for immediately studying the words you just looked up when you come to the end of a page. This second feature is perfect for people like myself who tend to look up lots of words but don’t end up taking the time to learn them.,Goals are most effective when they are quantified, so that left me with a question: How many new vocabulary words should I aim to learn this year?,For the answer, I asked Jenifer Larson-Hall, an associate professor of linguistics at the University of Kitakyushu. She told me that a person who is considerably busy with work should probably aim to learn 25 words a week, which is a realistic target. That works out to 1,300 words in a year, a number that should get me expressing myself better in no time.,I’m going to start working on my resolution from this week, I’ll let you know how I did in December.,Everybody has their own methods, and I’m always trying to find more ways to improve my studying. If there are any other resources you think deserve to be in the list, let me know in the comments below.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Happy New Year! While salutations of “,” (“Happy New Year”) filled the air in most parts of the country at the start of the month, my home was filled with exclamations of a different sort.,“So that’s where the lost , game card went,” I heard my wife shout. “Try to keep your dried ramen snacks in your mouth in the future, not under the sofa!” — that was her again, as was, “Ooh, it’s been dead quite a while, I think.” That last one came upon the discovery of a cockroach husk found under the refrigerator.,
,The Japanese have a lovely custom called “,,” or “big cleaning,” during the New Year holidays. That’s when we clean the dark corners, hard-to-reach spots and most bothersome places in our homes. I say it’s a lovely custom, but I graciously let my wife take the lead on doing most of it. She is the Japanese one in our relationship, after all, and I would never dream of cultural appropriation. In Scotland, a certain amount of dirt and mess is believed not only to build character but antibodies, too.,However, I do my part to keep our son busy so that the yearly ritual can take place without any obstacles. And, caught with the cleaning bug, I thought I’d tidy up a year’s worth of news tidbits from Japan in order to retain some essential stories and wisdom for 2022. May this small service in some way compensate for errant strands of dried ramen found in inappropriate spots around my home.,
,What if control of outer space were left to the Japanese? Well, maybe not all of it, but wouldn’t it be nice if Japan played a bigger role in extraterrestrial affairs?,This thought came to me when rereading an article from around the beginning of last year stating that Sumitomo Forestry and Kyoto University were partnering to try to construct wooden satellites, which would burn up upon re-entry to Earth, and thus cut down on space junk.,Western culture portrays space as “the final frontier,” or at least “Star Trek” does. For me, this narrative evokes an image of brave pioneers chopping down obstacles and pacifying native inhabitants in order to clear a path for colonization. Space entrepreneurs such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk tend to give the same impression.,Other highly militarized nations such as Russia and China seem to enjoy blowing things up in space, and testing weapons there. So I think a little more wabi-sabi could be brought to the inky blackness. That is, an appreciation for and accommodation with the beauty of nature’s complexities and imperfections, rather than an attempt to bring things under complete human mastery.,Before his fifth birthday last year, my son went through an intense “Astro Boy” phase. The now decades-old anime depicts the struggles of a robot boy’s acceptance into human society. Surely, this “Can’t we all just get along?” message is a better way to step into the future — or the galaxy — than visions of Klingon wars or chest-bursting “Alien” nightmares? (That film, by the way, is set in 2122, 100 years from now. Kids born today may actually live to see it come to fruition!),
,If Japan did rule space, those warp-speed portals would run like clockwork — relatively speaking. If the Sol System to Alpha Centauri Express were just a minute out, the unfortunate pilot would be scrubbing Portaloos on Pluto for a week.,I think we need a word that is equivalent to “punctual” but negative. We Scots like to think of ourselves as cannily frugal. Some others, such as England’s Samuel Johnson, have characterized this as tight-fistedness. You may be praised as meticulous, but take it too far and you will be criticized as fussy. But where is the word or expression for someone who is too fussily concerned about punctuality?,In November, it was revealed that a JR West train driver was suing his employers after he was docked ¥56 for driving his empty shinkansen to the depot a minute later than scheduled. I like an on-time train as much as the next person, but surely this is a clear case of punctual-retentiveness? Or hyper-punctuality Japonica disorder?,
,
,In an alternative career teaching English, I have a student in her 60s who refers to herself as “,,” which you could translate as “student running wild.” She refers to herself in this way to apologize whenever she gives an awkward answer to my innocuous conversation-starter questions. She doesn’t have a television or smartphone, and tends to profess a dislike of any cultural staple I put forward as an easy topic that couldn’t fail to elicit a positive response: “I don’t like the Beatles. They have such small faces,” or, “I can’t pick a favorite temple in Kyoto, I hate the place.”,Former Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara was once dubbed “,,” or “old man running wild,” for going off on far-right tangents in the media.,Last year showed that — albeit to a lesser degree than Ishihara’s extremism, and in a less endearing way than my student’s quirkiness — a certain generation of Japanese politicians is still prone to running wild while on mic. There are so many examples I could pick out, but the gold medal has to go to former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori’s sexist gaffe ahead of the Olympics. The then-83-year-old, and then-President of the Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee said, “If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying.”,Moving forward, I don’t think we should just forget this kind of comment, or shrug it off with an excuse like, “83-year-old men will be 83-year-old men.” Due to an ageing population and declining birth rate, younger Japanese are really going to have to push hard to exert greater influence. We’ll never get rid of fax machines at this rate!,But if I ever had to win the votes and affection of Japan’s disadvantaged youth, or any depressed underclass for that matter, 2021 taught me how to do it.,
,When Ueno Zoo’s panda Shin Shin gave birth to twins in June, shares in hospitality venues nearby were reported to have jumped in value in anticipation of a glut of visitors to the zoo. Hospitality venues no doubt deserve a boost, given the coronavirus-related difficulties they have had to put up with in recent times. But what is it with pandas?,Japan even has an expression that encapsulates the emotional, or dare I say irrational, appeal that pandas provoke: “,.” This literally refers to a panda that can draw in crowds of people, but it has been applied to celebrity politicians who may not know much about politics, but will nevertheless draw in voters. “We’re not expecting you to actually do much,” this expression suggests, “just sit there and look cute, and you’ll nevertheless attract a certain kind of voter.”,Just sitting there and munching bamboo might be a winner if you’re Shin Shin, but your spouse isn’t likely to find it cute if you sit around munching dried ramen snacks while they clean. At least, that’s what the ōsōji has taught me.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Staff writer,What do 21,081 steps look like? The organizers of Photohope hope to find out on an upcoming “photowalk” across Tokyo in support of mental health awareness.,Set to take place on World Mental Health Day, Oct. 10, the photowalk coincides with mental health nonprofit TELL Japan’s , — the same number of lives lost to suicide in Japan last year.,
,The photowalk, organized by Brian Scott Peterson and Yuko Yoshikawa, builds off the success of the duo’s ongoing Photohoku project, which they started in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011.,Driven by a desire to help those in need after witnessing the disaster from afar, Peterson and Yoshikawa made their way from Tokyo to the tsunami-struck Tohoku region in an attempt to provide more hands-on assistance.,With the tsunami presumably having washed away family photo albums and histories, the pair ,. Their efforts were initially met with skepticism, but this changed as they began giving photos away on the spot. Their shots included spontaneous snaps of children playing as well as family portraits. While such photos may have been the last thing on the minds of those who survived the disaster, they no doubt reminded them of what they still had — each other.,“Photography has the power to heal,” Yoshikawa tells The Japan Times. “That’s the reason why we continue Photohoku, and what we hope to expand upon through Photohope.”,Peterson adds that for them, “the act of photographing is more a reward than any one photo, camera or memory. … It’s the pursuit itself, and then everything else that comes with it.”,As the past 18 months have seen mental health issues take particular prominence in the headlines — from , , — activities like the Step Up Challenge and Photohope take on even more importance.,Additionally, the event pays homage to an anonymous Photohoku supporter who left behind a collection of film and cameras to the group after taking their own life. The film will be distributed freely to those who participate in the photowalk, but anything from digital cameras to smartphones can be used to take pictures on the 21,081-step journey from Totem Pole Photo Gallery in Shinjuku Ward to Sensoji temple in Taito Ward to Tokyo Tower in Minato Ward.,In order to maximize safety, Photohope is implementing infection prevention measures based on the Guidelines for the Prevention of the Spread of the New Coronavirus Infection of Tokyo. Organizers are asking participants to be mindful of distancing and to please minimize risk by masking up. If you have a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher, or if you have any physical symptoms, the organizers are asking that you refrain from participating and take care of yourself! If you don’t wish to take these precautions, the group asks that you please support them from home.,At approximately 14 kilometers, the journey may seem daunting. Photohoku stresses, though, that participants are free to choose whether they’d like to walk the full length or not. The primary focus is to have fun, increase awareness of mental health issues and to provide support to organizations dedicated to suicide prevention.,For more information on Photohope, visit ,.

Our Lives,,"For one dancer, the Mohiniyattam became a step to unlocking a whole new world","

			,Contributing writer,One of the best outcomes of a cultural exchange is when the person on the visiting end has their stereotypes shattered.,“Before I visited India, I had this image that everyone in India loves dancing,” recalls Hiromi Maruhashi, who moved to the country to study when she was 24. “But, only after I got there did I realize that not everyone likes or learns classical dance. It’s a minority, and I became one of them.”,
,Maruhashi, now 55, is an expert in Mohiniyattam dance, one of the recognized classical dances of India. It was developed in the southern state of Kerala, which is also referred to as “God’s own country,” and remains popular there to this day. Traditionally, the dance is performed solo by women and requires extensive training.,Originally from Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, Maruhashi initially chose to study Balinese dance at a university in Tokyo, which resulted in a trip to Indonesia.,
,
,When you first open the door to learning about other cultures, it’s hard to stop at just one. Likewise, Maruhashi’s own interests expanded and, eventually, her studies introduced her to the narratives and dances of South India. This is how she ended up at Kerala Kalamandalam, a public institute for art and culture where she learned Mohiniyattam.,“I loved Kerala so much that I didn’t want to come back to Japan,” she says. “But at the same time, I wanted to introduce this culture to Japan.”,For Maruhashi, the best part of the Mohiniyattam is the way the dancer uses their face. This performative element may have also been the reason she was drawn to learning about ,, an ancient form of Sanskrit theater.,“A person on their own can express anything,” she says. “In many other dances and performances, you need more than one person but, in this dance, you alone express everything, or you can even be different characters like a child, an animal, a hero or a killer — one person alone can narrate the whole story.”,When Maruhashi returned to Japan she began performing and teaching Mohiniyattam to others. This hasn’t been without its challenges, as the dancer feels a general lack of knowledge about Indian culture means local audiences aren’t able to fully understand the stories the performances are conveying. As a way to get around this, she has tried adding a screen with subtitles to her shows, but she also feels that when your mind is open to art and culture, full understanding isn’t required to have a meaningful experience.,“Sometimes a person just needs to enjoy art and not necessarily understand it,” she says, adding that she encourages Japanese audiences to come to a performance with that idea in mind. “You have to have imagination.”,Conversely, Maruhashi presents Japanese stories through Indian dance to audiences in India. She says these stories are understood well, perhaps as Indians are more accustomed to the medium. She even speculates that Indians might have better imaginations than her fellow Japanese.,As a way to rectify this imagination deficiency, Maruhashi hopes that her performances can introduce younger Japanese audiences to ideas they haven’t encountered before, and to show them how this is possible with classical dance.,“You could learn dance even if it is not the main source of income,” she says. “Your main job can support your hobby and, if you want, eventually your hobby, your passion, could become your main source of income. But you need to make an effort.”,Reflecting on her own experience, Maruhashi mentions her main source of income comes from translation jobs, from Malayalam to Japanese or English.

			,Staff writer,Educator, Japan scholar and trailblazer Joyce Chapman Lebra passed away on Oct. 10 in Boulder, Colorado, still wearing the Order of the Rising Sun medal and ribbon she had received in a ceremony a month prior. She was 95.,“She wore that award every single day after she received it,” her longtime friend David Wagner tells The Japan Times. “It meant a tremendous amount to her, a long overdue recognition.”,
,The conferring of state honors upon Lebra by the government of Japan on Aug. 27 was the culmination of a lifetime spent carving out her own path as a woman in a male-dominated field, one that saw her give voice to women in Asia through her writing and scholarly pursuits.,Lebra was a pioneer in many regards. She was the first woman in the United States to receive a doctorate in Japanese history, which she got from Harvard/Radcliffe in 1958, and she was the first female professor hired in the history department at the University of Colorado (CU) Boulder, where she taught Japanese history for 29 years.,“American academia wasn’t geared at that time for ambitious young women,” said CU Boulder professor emeritus Fred Anderson, a former colleague of Lebra ,.,At the same event, Anderson described how Lebra grew up in Hawaii and experienced the last vestiges of what he called “American imperialism,” citing that Hawaii in the 1930s was a place in which wealth was extracted by exploited native and imported labor. Lebra then moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, as a teenager where she was able to notice the contrast of white society on the mainland with the Hawaiian sugar plantations of her childhood.,“I can trace my interest in Japan back to my time in Honolulu because in the ’30s, Japanese were the largest ethnic group there. There was Japanese culture all around me,” Lebra said. “I remember being so proud that I could count to 100 in Japanese.”,Among her achievements were also some impressive anecdotes. For example, Lebra was apparently the only non-Japanese person to witness the final speech of Yukio Mishima before the literary icon attempted to overthrow the government, which eventually led to his suicide by ritual disembowelment. ,.,“The whole headquarters was in chaos, with newsmen swarming everywhere and 10 helicopters circling overhead,” Lebra wrote in the Times. She had been doing research in the military archives at the Ground Self-Defense Force garrison in Ichigaya at the time. When she heard the racket, she went outside to see what was going on. Mishima was delivering the speech. “I glanced around, saw that I was the only foreigner present, and a tall blond woman at that, and began to feel uncomfortable. I saw some soldiers pointing toward me and decided to head back to the library.”,Lebra bore witness to other moments of Japanese history, like when she first came to the country in 1955 and found a nation still coming to grips with the trauma of war.,“There were still black markets around the allies in those days,” ,. “We’d see soldiers and veterans with their limbs missing at almost all the train stations or sleeping in boxes at night in the winter.”,Throughout her career, Lebra wrote more than 15 books, dozens of articles and around 50 papers on Japan and other parts of Asia. Some are considered seminal works, particularly those focusing on her research into the intersection of Japanese empire-building and Indian independence such as “Jungle Alliance: Japan and the Indian National Army” (1971) and “Japanese-trained Armies in Southeast Asia” (1977).,She also wrote many novels, both fiction and nonfiction, about the plight of women in Asia, such as “Women in Changing Japan” (1976) and “Women Against the Raj: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment” (2008).,In her fictitious 2009 novel, “,,” Lebra sets the main character, Rie, in 19th-century Japan where she has to navigate a world of female oppression and heavy familial obligations. While Lebra grew up in a different time, she undoubtedly would have been familiar with some of the themes.,​​“The sexism and misogyny she experienced and the fight she carried on against (both) was a long-lasting lesson for me at the time,” said Bob Ferry, a colleague of Lebra’s at CU Boulder in the 1980s. “Her struggles to get salary equity and fair treatment made the principles of gender equality very real to all of us at CU.”,Marcia Yonemoto, a Japanese history professor at CU Boulder and current chair of the department, credits Lebra for better working conditions.,“By the time I was hired in the department in 1995, the faculty was about half women, many of them senior in rank, which was unusual for history departments at large research universities,” she tells The Japan Times. “In fact, in my 26 years on the faculty there have been more women chairs of the department than men, and although there are many reasons our department hired women, Joyce is certainly one of those reasons.”,
,
,Still, of her many accomplishments, she was particularly proud of the Order of the Rising Sun honor.,“Many people who have gotten the Order of the Rising Sun award have done a lot less than (Lebra) has done,” says Wagner, who personally lobbied the Consul-General of Japan in Denver, Midori Takeuchi, to consider Lebra for the distinction.,“When I first brought it up to Takeuchi-san, she said, ‘Who’s Dr. Joyce Lebra?’” Wagner recalls. “And why would she know who Dr. Lebra was? In the 30 years when she was a scholar, she was only recognized by academics in the know.”,To Takeuchi’s credit, however, she purchased every one of Lebra’s books in order to research the necessary information to make the recommendation to the Japanese government that Lebra should be given state honors.,“As an official imperial award, there is an incredible amount of bureaucracy to go through to get the official recognition,” Wagner adds. “It is thanks to Takeuchi that Joyce was finally recognized.”,Lebra’s story is one that deserves to be honored, not only for her “firsts” but for the amount of hard work she put into educating the world on Japan. Wagner recalls the joy she felt after receiving such recognition from the country she devoted her career to.,“You did it, Joyce, you crossed the finish line,” Wagner recalls telling her after she received the honor. “And after everything she’d done, she crossed the finish line smiling.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Whatever plans we had in life, the pandemic put a wrench in most of them. As lockdowns loomed around the world, there were some who made the quick decision to shake things up before COVID-19 took over.,For Terry Ellis, 60, a buyer and director for Japanese brand Beams Fennica, this meant moving to Japan. He had been splitting his life between London and Tokyo for the past four decades but, until recently, hadn’t spent longer than a two-month stretch here.,
,An uncertain time for many of us, the beginning days of the pandemic saw Ellis pack his bags and swap his home in Brixton, south London, for an apartment in Tokyo’s counter-cultural Koenji neighborhood.,
,
,“I was in London just as they announced the pandemic, I was there for a month trying to buy hand sanitizer,” recalls Ellis, who adds that he’s had a kidney transplant. “My doctor advised me that there would be a lockdown and that I was indeed to go as soon as possible, so I got the next flight out and I came here.,“Five days later it was the lockdown and I haven’t been back since.”,Now very much at home in Tokyo, Ellis and his wife, Keiko Kitamura, have curated a museum-like space in their apartment. The rooms are adorned with carefully crafted displays of Japanese folk crafts, African art and mid-century modern furniture.,“Each time we move, we create a new space,” explains Ellis, dressed in an indigo-blue jacket and sitting in the middle of his tatami-mat living room. “Keiko found this flat for me and it’s been fun figuring out how to live the whole time in a Japanese place.”,The pair met in London in the 1980s, and were established trendsetters. Together, they began working as stylists for record labels such as Island and Virgin, dressing bands for music videos and album covers. Ellis himself had moved to London from Jamaica when he was 7, and his Caribbean roots are a strong contributing factor in his work.,In the 1990s they began working with Japanese lifestyle store Beams, which had launched as a clothing brand in the ’70s and was still a relatively minor player. It is now one of the best-known brands in Japan.,Beams recruited Ellis and Kitamura to guide its buyers around the city and send them information about the market. In other words, coolhunters. The pair have worked with Beams ever since and now head the in-house label Fennica, which was launched in 2003.,
,With an eye for aesthetics and deep cultural knowledge, the couple source second-hand designer pieces and create original items that are heavily influenced by Japanese folk crafts and Scandinavian design.,Ellis honed his knowledge of Japanese craftsmanship and artisanal talent during twice-yearly trips here through the 2000s and 2010s. He has visited the country’s many islands in search of inspiration, exploring the world of pottery, kilns and the associated workshops. It was during one of these visits that he met product designer Sori Yanagi, son of Soetsu Yanagi (1889-1961), pioneer of the , (folk arts) movement.,“We started importing Scandinavian design because we wanted things that were made the same way they were made in the 1950s and ’60s, and that was still the case in Scandinavia,” Ellis says. “We were looking around for similar things in Japan and came across Sori Yanagi.”,This friendship with Yanagi, who was then the director of the Mingeikan (Japan Folk Crafts Museum), gave Ellis invaluable insight into Japanese folk art, ceramics and textiles, helping to shape his creative direction. He was introduced to other artisans who were directly influenced by the elder Yanagi, and began working with both factories and workshops, combining folk crafts and Scandinavian modern design.,
,
,Developing the aesthetics of the Fennica brand, Ellis built connections with pottery kilns all over Japan, favoring those (particularly in Okinawa) who work cooperatively instead of individually.,These workshops have a master, Ellis explains, and the potters under the master all work in cooperation; they may make individual pieces but there’s usually a particular style and range for the workshop as a whole, and the kilns are able to produce numerous pots in a honed, highly skilled way — a system attributed by Sori Yanagi to his father.,“Over the years we’ve become very close to the potters and now we’re working with their children and their apprentices,” Ellis says. “I was very lucky because for Western people, normally, unless you’re a potter or some famous intellectual, you’re not going to get taught much about these people.”,
,Dividing his life between Tokyo and London means Ellis is equally at home in two of the world’s most vibrant and artistic metropolises. One month he’s mixing with artisans in the Japanese countryside, and the next he’s walking through Brixton Market soaking up the sights and sounds of London’s Afro-Caribbean community.,“I’ve been doing it for so long, when nobody else was doing it,” he says over the balmy beats of a reggae record in his apartment. “In the 1980s and part of the ’90s, there was no one I could really talk to about Japan because people would just want to know about Kyoto and geisha and samurai … Nobody was traveling to Okinawa.”,Ellis says any chaos associated with managing a life across two cultures is worth it as his aesthetic lies in the very merging of both these worlds and their respective identities. His London apartment is stylishly decorated with Japanese items — so much so that he says he feels like he’s still in Japan when he’s there.,“When I’m in Japan I forget about London and when I’m in London it is difficult to forget about Japan,” he says. “I don’t particularly look forward to getting back to London because it’s ordinary life, but here there’s still this excitement in discovery.”,Another geographical constant that ties in to his work comes from his Caribbean roots.,“I haven’t been there for 30 or 40 years, but Jamaica is everywhere,” he says. “I don’t need to go to Jamaica to experience Jamaica. I experience Jamaica here (in Japan) all of the time. There’s even a reggae bar down the road.”,Ellis’ work often incorporates nods to Caribbean culture, but mainly of the variety that thrives on the streets of Brixton. He tends to take these London-infused elements and tweak them slightly, saying, “I understand it fully and I can do things with it that people who don’t really understand it will be shy to do.”,Ellis pulls out one of the items he’s made for Fennica: a sweater of Rastafarian red, gold and green, slightly subverted with a murky yellow and pinkish hue, and incongruously knitted by hand on Scotland’s Shetland Islands. Kitamura is wearing another of their pieces, a traditional West African dashiki shirt made with Japanese denim and old Japanese indigo fabric, and adorned with an applique lion.,“I’ll try to introduce that culture to people who are not necessarily passionate about Jamaica but who view it as a kind of high fashion, not street fashion,” he says. “I do the same kind of thing with mingei, so it’s just part of my cultural identity.”,Decades of exploring Japan’s islands, visiting cities and rural workshops has naturally had an effect on Ellis’ character. He mentions how he is often left behind at pedestrian crossings in London while everyone else rushes across before the lights turn.,“It’s just small things,” he says, “I think if you live in Japan for a while, you become more patient.,“You take Japan with you. It’s a way of living and a way of thinking.”,For now, Ellis doesn’t have to take Japan anywhere, though, he’s here and established. Even the pandemic hasn’t dampened his enthusiasm for the country and the culture.,“When I’m in London everything that happens, I expect it to happen,” he says. “Here, it’s difficult to put it into words, but the feeling I have, it’s just endless possibilities. Nothing is really quotidian for me. Every day something strange happens. There’s a sort of bubbling excitement the whole time.,“I’m 60 this year, and there’s nowhere else to go,” he says, laughing. “I’m going to spend more time here, but I’ll always live in London … and I think I’ll always live in Brixton, but I think I’ll spend more time here because my family is here now.”,Terry Ellis shares his creative process on his Instagram page, ,.

			,Contributing writer,Before Japan’s borders closed over fears of the omicron variant last week, ,. Seeing them escape the situation might be bittersweet for Afghans already residing here, however. While this group is safe, there are still many who aren’t.,Those are the thoughts of “Alex,” an Afghan living in Japan whose family remains in a dire situation at home due to the fall of the government to the Taliban.,
,I can’t tell you Alex’s real name. If I do, they believe the Taliban will target their family.,I cannot say if Alex is a man or a woman. Nor where in Japan they live, nor where they work. I can tell you that Alex wants to speak out in the hopes that someone will listen, but is also afraid.,On May 1, just six months ago, Alex was feeling more at ease. Absorbed in research and having picked up some extra work, life was good. They came to Japan to gain essential skills in their field, hoping to one day return to Afghanistan and work more effectively at their old job there. Work was smooth, and Alex was falling in love with the freedoms found in an open society like Japan.,On the same day, the Taliban launched a widespread offensive across Afghanistan, following the start of withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.,For a long time, even Alex couldn’t see what was coming.,“I was totally not expecting the Taliban to take over the country,” they say. “I wasn’t expecting it because we as a country improved a lot compared to 20 years ago. I really didn’t imagine that they would take control.”,Three months later, in early August, Alex went to their apartment to rest and talk with family and friends, keeping in touch with the situation in Afghanistan. They sent texts and made calls, read the news and checked social media. And waited.,“Please take it easy,” Alex texted friends back home. “Why are you so negative? You should believe our soldiers and government. Please don’t demotivate our soldiers.”,Later that evening, Alex checked the news about the Taliban’s progress. Just over half of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces were under control of the Taliban, as the Afghan National Army suffered repeated defeats across the country. The government assured citizens that they were prepared to defend themselves against any onslaught. Alex went to sleep confident, unafraid, vowing to remind their friends of how worried and uncertain they were on the day when their soldiers and people rose up to defeat the Taliban.,By morning, Alex’s home province had fallen.,
,A few days later on Aug. 15, Alex was enjoying an evening with friends at home. That was the day that Kabul fell.,As Alex relaxed and ate in peace, Taliban fighters entered the city. They seized the Pul-e-Charkhi prison and released inmates, including captured Islamic State and al-Qaida militants. Afghan military planes and helicopters fled to Uzbekistan. President Ashraf Ghani relinquished power and, shortly thereafter, fled. By 8:55 p.m. local time, the Taliban had taken over Kabul’s presidential palace.,“I was just shocked,” Alex says. “I felt like someone pushed me from a high height to the ground.”,The events of August changed Alex’s life in more ways than one. New, inescapable emotions emerged: fear, guilt, anger. In the following weeks, crumbling mental health led them to seek help from a psychologist.,“I can’t believe how different I am,” Alex says.,It’s no surprise that the turn of events has crippled Alex’s mental health. Horror after horror has struck Afghanistan. ,. Around 15,000 Afghans attempted to escape, overcrowding the airport, leading the foreign soldiers to resort to tear gas and beating. A few days later, ,.,Just over a month later, a deadly mosque bombing on Oct. 8, carried out by an Islamic State suicide bomber in Kunduz, ,. Now, brutal poverty grips much of the country, with huge swaths of the population unemployed or unable to work due to the violence, disruptions or working for the old Afghan government. ,, as thousands of facilities have run out of essential medicines and doctors haven’t been paid in months. ,. Musicians and artists struggle to escape. Some of the ,.,Not to mention the struggles specific to Alex’s family. Publishing identifying information could be perilous, as their relatives have already been targeted by the Taliban. The Taliban arrested a family member, brutally beat them, and robbed them. Now, everyone in Alex’s family is out of a job.,“They’re at home, they can’t work, they can’t go to university,” Alex says. “Everyone is just waiting for what will happen, just at home. They don’t know anything.”,
,
,Starting Aug. 15, Alex’s family didn’t have access to the internet because of the coup. The only way to contact their family was by calling via SIM card, but the costs of the SIM bills were so great that eventually Alex became unable to keep in touch any longer. Fortunately, starting in September, internet connection improved enough to allow Alex to send messages via WhatsApp.,“They wanted and tried to leave Afghanistan, but some of my family don’t have passports,” Alex explains. Passports were never easily obtainable for Afghans, but now that’s out of the question. The family, holed up together, considered “underground” ways to leave the country, but they were worried the younger members wouldn’t be able to make the journey. An acquaintance of Alex’s escaped to Iran via one of these routes, but lost her child on the way.,“It’s very difficult to be here (in Japan) when we’re in the situation that my family is experiencing,” Alex says, adding that they don’t know whether or not, if they hadn’t been in Japan, they would have been killed by Taliban soldiers. Now, they are sitting comfortably in a Japanese apartment, left to wonder what is going on at home.,The situation could hardly be more dire. ,. Alex, safely removed from the situation, is employed. They have access to all the necessary amenities: groceries, shelter, health care. Then, there are all of Japan’s other amenities that Afghans can’t even imagine having now: 24-hour convenience stores, regular trains and an environment where Alex doesn’t have to worry about speaking to a stranger — or even just someone who isn’t family.,“When I came to Japan, I felt a lot of changes in my life,” Alex says. “I felt like I was living as a human. Afghanistan is so strict, we have so many limitations that we don’t have in Japan. I felt so comforted, which is why I was so active and working so hard. I don’t worry about going out and talking with the opposite gender. My mind is fully relaxed. So everything was good and strong with me.”,The topic of gender in particular strikes a chord with Alex. Last week, , and could not be forced into marriage, but nothing has been said about women’s right to work and an education. , and Alex says they can only receive education at underground schools. Women are not allowed to go into the office. “I wish to never become a parent of a girl in Afghanistan.”,
,The war in Afghanistan came and went. The Taliban’s takeover came and went. The viral airport photos came and went. The world’s attention, likewise, came and went. But the poverty and suffering continue.,“I want people to understand the poverty of Afghans,” Alex says. “People need to recognize that.”,The longer Alex talks about the situation, it becomes apparent how complex their emotions are. The way the attention of the world shifted to Afghanistan just at the moment of the Taliban’s takeover, and then quickly moved on, was especially infuriating.,“By the time the world started talking about Afghanistan, it was too late for us,” Alex says. “When I’m seeing the support of the world for Afghanistan, it does not make me happy. It hurts me.,“Everyone was busy before. When they saw we lost everything, when they saw we lost the young generation, when some people could evacuate and others were killed by the Taliban …” Alex trails off, frustrated.,When countries sent planes to evacuate their own citizens and the Afghans who were working with them, Alex couldn’t stop thinking of all the other innocent people that were left with no choice but to remain.,“Was it their mistake that they couldn’t earn the opportunities to work with foreigners?” Alex wonders. “(People) are ready to sell their kidneys to earn money and provide food for their families, and the world is watching. Parents at the height of their misery are ready to sell their children to protect them from starvation, but the world is just watching.”,While it may seem that there is little that those in Japan and other countries can do to help the people of Afghanistan, Alex says the best way is likely financial. While many humanitarian agencies were forced to flee amid the coup, some remained: ,, ,, the , and , to name a few.,The best the world can do now is protect the people who are dying from poverty and starvation. And with the oncoming winter, the cold weather provides an additional threat for the jobless and homeless.,Aid workers also say that people in other countries can help by contacting their elected officials and telling them what kind of response they would like to see from their government.,With a harsh winter coming, Alex can only hope that by speaking out something might possibly change — it’s really the only hope they have at the moment.,“I want people to imagine how it feels to suddenly experience this kind of situation. How this situation can destroy a person’s life,” Alex says. “And what it felt like when I heard the silence of the world.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

So what took the community by surprise was the fact the embassy issued a statement on such profiling, not that it was happening.,
,The ,’s Committee on Protection of Foreigners’ Human Rights wants to better understand the situation regarding racial profiling by police in Japan. It has launched a survey and is asking those who believe they have been the target of profiling — or their family or friends — to take a moment and fill out the survey in order to get a clearer picture of what is going on.,“The survey on racial profiling by police in Japan is an encouraging step toward addressing long-standing issues with the way in which police perceive and interact with people from international and multicultural communities in Japan,” says Tina Saunders, director and associate professor of instruction in law at the Beasley School of Law at Temple University, Japan Campus. “Capturing and sharing people’s experiences with the police gives us a powerful tool to push for change in police policies and training to better engage with these communities.”,Pandemic-era stress has manifested in some Western countries as xenophobia and violence directed at people of Asian and Pacific island decent, sparking the need for movements such as ,.,Xenophobia continues to be an area of concern for many in Japan’s foreign community, too, , due to border policies enacted to prevent the spread of the virus and a perception among the Japanese that non-Japanese people are more likely to carry it. The arrival of the omicron variant has made matters worse, prompting a sharp rise in new cases and ,.,“We have received 773 responses in the first 24 hours of the survey,” says lawyer Junko Hayashi, who is coordinating the survey. “We are surprised by the number that we have received in such a short time. That shows how big an issue this is. We are hoping to have as many responses as possible so we can gain a fuller understanding of how widespread this problem is. I believe this is a critically important initiative.”,Saunders is hopeful that the project will result in meaningful action.,“Hopefully, we can use the information to spark important and broader conversations on the pervasive problem of stereotyping and ‘othering’ happening in Japan,” she says, adding that the goal should be “equitable treatment of everyone regardless of status or identity.”,Access the Tokyo Bar Association’s survey at , until Feb. 10.

			,Contributing writer,Technology has made it possible for anyone to seem like they possess a high level of photographic ability. Between cameras that do the thinking for the user, and user-friendly apps that can reduce or even eliminate most errors and leave the user with a professional-looking finished product, it’s easy to forget that photography is more than just taking pictures: It’s art.,A photographer who crosses over into the realm of art, Matthew Jordan Smith took up residence here in Japan six years ago. His resume of celebrity portraits reads like the red carpet roll call at a Hollywood bash: Aretha Franklin, Oprah Winfrey, Queen Latifah and Zendaya, to name a few.,
,Born in Brooklyn, New York, the 58-year-old Smith found his way to Tokyo in part thanks to his now wife, Maki. The couple met in the 1990s but didn’t start dating until 2014. Two years later they were married.,“I moved to Japan because I’ve always loved it here,” Smith says. “I came to visit about 20 times before moving here. Also, Maki was here and we were doing the long-distance relationship thing for two years. So I made the decision to move.”,One of the most fascinating things about Tokyo is meeting non-Japanese residents with impressive histories. In addition to his celebrity clientele, Smith has shot commercial photography for Pantene, Revlon and HBO, and has published three books: “Sepia Dreams,” “Lost and Found” and “Future American President.” The former showcases his celebrity portraits while the latter two works focus on families whose children have gone missing or have been abducted, and children across the United States — any of whom could be president one day.,
,Smith only spent some of his upbringing in New York, his family later moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was introduced to photography. Unfamiliar with southern customs and norms, and sporting a New York accent, marked him an outsider and left young Matthew open to bullying. It was during this painful period that his father presented him with his first camera.,“It saved me, the camera did,” Smith says. “My father taught me how to use it, he even taught me how to develop my photos. I took to it right off the bat, shooting as often as possible, and developed the photos in a bathroom my father converted into a darkroom. It used to drive my sisters crazy! They’d be knocking on the door, and I’d shout, ‘I’ll be out in a minute, the photos are in the fixer!’,
,
,“I was drawn to shooting people. I would shoot black-and-white photos of people in my church, or sporting events or my mother braiding my sister’s hair. Stuff like that. I think it’s safe to say photography found me rather than my finding it.”,After seeing the work of Black photographers like the great Gordon Parks Sr., Smith began to imagine himself shooting subjects professionally as a career. He enrolled at The Art Institute of Atlanta in 1982 to further his study, and would shoot sports events around the city. One time he snapped a picture of a marathon roller-skater and sent the photo to Sports Illustrated magazine.,“And they actually bought it,” Smith recalls excitedly. “It was my first submission and they paid me $100 for it. After that, I was the big man on campus. Not only had I sold a photo, but I had a check from Sports Illustrated in my pocket! Not many college students could say that.”,Despite the success, Smith dropped out of school long before graduating, a decision prompted by the words of one of his professors.,“He told the class that the best photographers are in New York and Europe,” Smith says, “and that if a young photographer wanted to break into the photography game, he or she should make their way to New York or Paris or so forth, find a photographer plying their trade and assist them. It was great advice!”,Smith moved back to New York in 1987 and began working as an assistant for one photographer after another. His first job was assisting a catalog photographer, shooting for JC Penney and Sears for about $200 a week, barely enough to pay the rent on the apartment he’d found in Harlem. However, once he was in the door of the industry, other opportunities presented themselves and it wasn’t long before he was working as a freelance assistant for some of the more renowned fashion photographers there.,“And, in New York, that’s your training,” Smith says. “I worked with everyone and traveled everywhere. I never traveled before in my life, and here I was traveling all over Europe with fashion photographers shooting fashion spreads, meeting all the models, meeting all the magazine editors, and that established me in the world.”,
,Smith would work as an assistant for another 3½ years, building a solid reputation in an industry where Black men were still a rarity. While his color caused some embarrassing moments, like when one Victoria’s Secret editor mistook him for a messenger, for the most part, things weren’t any more debilitating than they would be in any other industry.,
,
,He developed relationships with many of the models, shot them on his own after work and then used these pictures to build up his own portfolio. The models were so pleased with the work Smith did for them privately that they began to spread the word about him and his gifted eye. His big break came when an agent approached him about taking him on as a client. Once he had representation, he began to get jobs as the lead photographer. His assisting days were over.,Smith got his first major job as lead photographer in 1992. It was a shoot for Essence, a monthly lifestyle magazine ubiquitous in the Black community that covers fashion, beauty, entertainment and culture. This led to steady work with the magazine including his first high-profile job, shooting Anita Hill during the height of the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings for judge Clarence Thomas. Hill made headlines when she accused Thomas of sexual harassment, a term that wasn’t widely known in the zeitgeist at the time.,In 1994, Essence gave Smith his first celebrity cover shoots, three in the same year: actress Halle Berry; former Miss America, singer and actress Vanessa Williams; and media mogul Oprah Winfrey.,This string of shoots broke down any barriers left standing in Smith’s way. Word-of-mouth reviews were positive and he developed a reputation for getting a job done quickly, efficiently and well. He soon became an in-demand photographer who was getting calls from magazines, major corporations and even Hollywood.,
,Smith branched out into the role of author at the turn of the century, publishing “Sepia Dreams” in 2001. His latest project is a book about Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, who passed away in 2018.,“We had such an amazing relationship, Aretha and I,” Smith says. “I spent the last 13 years of her life shooting her. Sometimes she’d call me in the middle of the night asking me which name I thought was best for her new CD. She was great like that. She was the only celebrity I know that didn’t want to talk to you through an intermediary. She’s working with you? Then , wants to talk to you.”,
,
,Through his photography, Smith has traveled all over the world. This included a trip to China after a surprise request.,“Out of the blue, I was contacted by Jian Cao, a wealthy Chinese businessman,” he says. “He hired me for a photo project and flew me and my crew to China, first-class, to shoot 75 Chinese directors and actors. He put us up in a nice hotel and we did shoots all over Beijing and Shanghai. It was unbelievable.”,Smith and his wife now live a shorter distance from China, in Tokyo, one of the most photographed places in the world. And with photography becoming a more common hobby thanks to ever-improving smartphones, Smith says that budding photographers need to refine their artistry to make a career out of it.,“There are probably more photographers in the world now than ever in human history,” he says. “So to stand out in this world, you have to have your own vision. There are like 7 billion people on the planet, each with a unique fingerprint? Well, you need to find your fingerprint visually, and use it so you can stand out. Discover what’s unique about you and only shoot your photos using your own vision. That’s what will make you a star.”,For more information on Matthew Jordan Smith, visit ,.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Sometimes, riding the JR Yamanote Line feels like a challenge fit for an athlete. Crucial for many a city journey, this rail route transports millions of people each day, connecting them to the major transport hubs of Shinjuku, Shibuya and Ikebukuro — the three busiest train stations in the world.,Battling commuters for a seat on the Yamanote is one thing, but a more enjoyable challenge is , the entire length of the 34.5 kilometer-long line, past all 30 of its stops.,
,That’s the idea behind the Tokyo Yamathon, which began in 2010. The annual event challenges groups of individuals to walk or jog the Yamanote in an effort to raise money for charity — an endeavor that typically takes around 12 hours to complete (in contrast, it only takes an hour or so to ride the entirety of the loop by rail).,After a year-long pause due to the pandemic, the International Volunteer Group Japan team behind the event is back with a new iteration for 2021 — Your Yamathon — and are ready for people to walk the line once more for a good cause.,
,“We were determined to bring the Yamathon back for 2021 in a way that would be safe, but still capture the spirit of the event,” says Zain Abba, head of media for Tokyo Yamathon. “So we worked very hard to create Your Yamathon for people to be able to challenge themselves.”,
,
,In previous years, the Yamathon was a scheduled event taking place over the course of one day, with more than 1,100 participants kicking off from the same starting point. This year’s temporarily re-named iteration has been adapted to the COVID era, allowing participants to choose their own date, time and starting station.,The adjusted event also spreads the Yamathon out over the course of a three-month window between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, and participants can either go it alone or form a team of up to four members. With the number of new COVID-19 cases hitting record lows since the pandemic began, the aim is to have fun safely and do something healthy.,“I think a lot of people are a little exhausted of virtual events, so hopefully this version of the Yamathon will appeal,” says director Mark Legard. For those who have spent many months working from home, or apart from loved ones, the day-long walk could be a much needed chance to reconnect with friends, family and colleagues — and get some exercise.,
,The challenge isn’t just about the sweet satisfaction of completing the course (although that does feel pretty good), there’s a more community-centric motivation behind the Yamathon. Past events have raised money for Oxfam Japan and the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. This year, all of the proceeds will go to the ,, which is scheduled to open Nov. 21.,The hospice will be only the second of its kind in Japan, a much-needed facility that can provide a place for children who are affected by life-threatening or limiting diseases to receive care and respite. The facility will also offer support to those children’s families.,“The Yamathon is all about an army of good people coming together to do something extraordinary for themselves and for others,” says Joe Pournovin, Tokyo Yamathon’s founder and CEO. He adds that the hospice “will give children a magical space to connect and create bonds with other children in a similar situation.”,“It will give parents who spend every minute of their lives with their child a break,” he continues. “They’ll be able to leave their child in a wonderful environment, one that can also connect families who are going through similar circumstances.”,At its core, the Yamathon is an opportunity to put a spotlight on the importance of providing children’s palliative care. The hospice facility, which uses the slogan “,” (“A home of sea and sky”), has been specially designed to ensure children and their families feel supported and are able to spend meaningful time together.,“(These children) have every right to learn, to have fun and have the life and opportunities any normal child has,” Pournovin says. “We stand proud with the Yokohama Children’s Hospice Project and with these amazing families.,
,
,With the hospice’s opening date fast approaching, and cases of COVID-19 around the country dwindling, there’s never been a better excuse to dig out your sweats and give the Yamathon a go., doing the Yamathon challenge in 2019, mentioning that some teams opt to take pit stops at cafes, temples and parks. Indeed, one of his own takeaways was that the course is a great way to see parts of Tokyo that you haven’t visited before.,“The overriding atmosphere is one of fun and happiness, along with the feeling of satisfaction you get from walking that distance at the end,” Legard says. “It’s very hard to describe, you really have to take part to appreciate it.”,While taking part is all that really counts, for those lacing up their walking shoes and hitting the urban trail, the Yamathon team has some advice to help you along the course.,“Make sure you have good shoes,” Legard cautions. “It is (also) important when putting a team together to ensure you all have the same walking pace and goals in mind to really enjoy the day.”,For Abba, the key to success is the right kind of rest.,“Take breaks, but don’t stay in one place for too long. It can be hard to build up momentum again,” he says. “Even though it is primarily a walking event, it is still physically taxing. It’s important to prepare.”,Registration closes on Dec. 10, with the window of Your Yamathon “race days” closing on Dec. 31. Participants will be sent an online map of the suggested route, but shortcuts are allowed as long as all teams visit all 30 stations along the Yamanote Line.”,Still thinking about it? “Just sign up,” Pournovin says. “If you think a full-Yamathon is too much, take the half-option. After the past 18 months, this is the perfect event for you to reconnect with the people in your life.”,For more information, visit ,.

			,Contributing writer,Women’s organization FEW Japan took off long before women’s empowerment became front page news in this country. Forty years on and it’s more dedicated than ever to helping meet the needs of women here.,Since its founding in October 1981, the Tokyo-based network of globally minded, English-speaking women has grown from the seed of an idea contemplated by two friends to a 150-strong membership hosting some 50 events annually. Encompassing a shared goal of motivating, inspiring and connecting, the program of speaker events, lunches, seminars and networking sessions has attracted more and more women to attend year on year, exceeding 1,000 in 2020 despite the pandemic.,
,
,
,“FEW is a safe and brave space for women to imagine and invest in their potential and be inspired by and support each other. That’s never going to not be needed in Japan,” says President Jackie Steele, pointing to Japan’s ranking of 120th among 156 countries in the ,.,Now, as the association enters its fifth decade of operations, its past and current leadership have been looking back on some milestones in the association’s history and contemplating how to continue delivering for women effectively amid the challenges of the pandemic and beyond.,Although legally incorporated as For Empowering Women Japan since 2020, the FEW Not-for-Profit Incorporated Association was originally launched as Foreign Executive Women by Tokyo-based Elyse Rogers and Jane Waugh who missed the professional social networks they had enjoyed in the United States. Their idea was to offer networking events primarily for career women, which would be held in nice venues outside the home, much like their male counterparts were attending at the time. In filling a gap in the market, membership began to grow steadily and, in the 1990s, the organization added a biennial careers strategy seminar to its offering to further support members’ professional development.,In the 2000s, though, as the number of Japanese women in corporate positions grew, so too did calls within FEW for membership to be opened up to them alongside a renaming of the organization to reflect the change. The proposal was eventually carried out in 2008 under the tenure of then-president Julia Maeda, co-founder of bespoke travel agency Okuni.,“As a board member, it made me uncomfortable that FEW didn’t allow Japanese members. There were many talented women who therefore didn’t qualify to be members,” Maeda recalled during FEW’s public online anniversary celebration in October. A handful of members were opposed due to concern the meetings “might become like English lessons” but they were overruled in what she describes as “one of the most significant changes for FEW in its history.”,Buoyed by a wave of incoming members keen to embrace FEW’s new mission of empowering all women in Japan, the organization continued to diversify its offerings, expanding its speaker lineup to include women from all sectors of society including politics, the media, sport, startups, the arts, academia and not-for-profit groups.,With the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent meltdown at Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, FEW faced another challenge: sustaining its community amid the large-scale departure of members from Japan to their home countries.,“Our strategy was to super-serve the remaining members,” explained then-president Sarah Furuya, founder and coach at Sarah Furuya Coaching, at FEW’s October event. With investment in high-quality events that offered great food and drink as well as special entertainment, Furuya and her team sought to retain and really look after members in the hope it would lead to women being enticed to join or return.,
,
,After weathering the storm, Women’s Startup Club, which was launched as an independent group in 2012, was brought under the FEW umbrella in 2016. Since then, WSC has adopted an annual program covering topics that entrepreneurs need to consider for business success including maximizing the digital space, leveraging masterminds and utilizing the startup’s brand story.,“The idea was to create a theme that you could build on, like Lego blocks, not a one-off,” says then-director Tanja Bach, CEO and founder of Contents Bridge.,More recently, FEW has been forced to adapt due to the cancelation of in-person events to curb the spread of COVID-19. Events continue to be held entirely online, which has provided surprising benefits to the association, according to Steele.,“We’ve leaned into FEW Japan since the outbreak of the pandemic,” she says, pointing out that holding remote events has seen membership rise across all parts of the country, whereas membership was once Tokyo-focused. “We’re serving the diversity of women who call Japan home.”,“Going digital in 2020 has offered an easier way for people to access meetings,” says Co-president Terri MacMillan. New attendees include women based in Tokyo and other parts of the country who find it difficult to access child care, have mobility issues or simply feel less comfortable at a large in-person event.,Last year also saw FEW become more financially accessible, with the introduction of its lowest membership fee in decades, at ¥10,000 per annum, says Steele. The move was possible due to FEW’s new status as a general incorporated association, making it capable of inviting companies to support its work via paid memberships to boost its financial sustainability. And corporate Japan’s drive to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, including achieving gender equality, is stimulating an uptick in interest to support FEW.,
,
,Audi Japan and Jarman International are among the firms to invest in a corporate sustaining membership, which permits them to give memberships to women in their organizations, while seven other firms are organizational members.,“So many people are seeing the value in investing in women’s equality in this country,” Steele says, adding that firms believe in supporting a community for women’s empowerment.,Looking ahead, numerous FEW directors shared their excitement at the October meeting about the upcoming peer-to-peer networking program to be launched this month. Designed to support women in one of three positions — corporate worker, entrepreneur or explorer (pivoting or returning to work) — the interactive sessions will be built for “connection, learning and conversations.”,“We want to be the go-to place for women’s personal and professional development in Japan,” Steele says. “This initiative opens up a more concrete space for women in the in-between zone, such as stay-at-home moms or trailing spouses. We’re not only for professional women with a business card.”,FEW board directors, all of whom are volunteers, are also enjoying a new support structure. Each role is shared by two individuals to reduce pressure on the team and promote the development of a leadership pipeline. The goal is to boost FEW’s resilience and sustainability so it can continue to drive women’s empowerment in Japan for another 40 years or more.,For more information on FEW Japan, visit ,.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The angst Lindsay Nelson was seeing on her Twitter feed was palpable. As the Meiji University assistant professor read post after post by fellow scholars unable to come to Japan to conduct academic research due to pandemic-related border restrictions, she felt she had to do something.,“I’ve been in situations where I was stranded outside Japan,” Nelson tells The Japan Times. “Situations where I thought, ‘It would be so great if I had someone who could get me this one magazine article or this one random pamphlet that just isn’t available digitally.’”,
,This led Nelson to put out a tweet offering a free “grab and deliver” service for scholars who needed a particular item for their research that could only be accessed in Japan. She offered to take requests, find the necessary material and get it to the scholar who needed it. It was her own small way to help out those who won’t be able to conduct research in Japan for the foreseeable future.,Aoyama Gakuin University professor Chelsea Szendi Schieder saw Nelson’s tweet, and got in touch to recommend a group effort. She suggested creating a more formalized process for scalability and to reach beyond just contacts on Twitter. The resulting , quickly became a focus of attention for those in the field of Japan studies, with hundreds of shares and retweets.,The volunteer-led offering puts scholars outside Japan in touch with those based in Japan for research support, but isn’t intended for heavy-duty requests or those that violate copyright law. The volunteers offer to help locate a paid research assistant for those who need more extensive support.,In just 48 hours since the announcement tweet on Dec. 8, more than 30 scholars in Japan had registered to help locate documents for their peers locked out of the country, and 13 requests for assistance were received. Those numbers are expected to grow as word spreads.,
,Why do scholars need this type of help? In an echo of the barriers to teleworking found in Japanese companies, Japanese libraries tend to work on the assumption that people will physically go there to utilize their resources. Digitization of archival materials is not as common in Japan as it is in many countries overseas, and many Japanese institutions actively resist it. Additionally, even digitized resources may only be available for viewing onsite. As a result, “it’s very difficult to do research remotely,” according to Tokyo-based independent researcher Angseop Lee, who has been helping to organize the support effort.,The lack of digitization and stringent gatekeeping historically led to “a situation where scholars needed funding to come to Japan to do the research, because there was no other way to access it,” University of Tokyo project associate professor Samantha Landau says. But with the pandemic border controls, that approach is “not working anymore.”,The project organizers look at what they are doing as a Band-Aid, not a permanent solution. Schieder describes it as “a creative workaround, and constrained by copyright laws, but not enough to really address the longer term problems created by border closures.”,The scholars’ “offer of help is generous and invaluable, but this is a huge systemic problem,” says Mark Ravina, a history professor at The University of Texas at Austin. He believes that “gracious individual scholars should not be expected to repair damage caused by educational policy failures.”,“Ultimately it’s the responsibility of the people in power to figure out a way to safely bring researchers here,” Landau says.,“There should be some kind of formal system in place where either government or educational institutions should be able to help researchers,” Nelson says. “Almost two years into the pandemic, we need to be coming up with better ways to do this. What we really want is first of all a push for more digitization of materials and an end to the travel ban and a more gradual and fair entry of students, researchers and students into Japan.”,The current plan is to continue the support project at least until the travel restrictions are lifted. “Beyond that, hopefully by then there will have been some changes in the whole way the system operates,” Nelson adds.,
,
,While this project may provide much-needed help for some researchers, it can’t really take the place of coming to Japan.,“How can graduate students complete their dissertations if they can’t do research here?” asks James Welker, a professor at Kanagawa University who has helped with scanning and sending documents to scholars overseas through the project. “You can’t do ethnography or deep archival research via Zoom or interlibrary loan or via Japan-based scholars.” And even if someone could manage to conduct their research remotely, “How will they get jobs if they’ve lost their prestigious fellowships and affiliations and lost their chance to meet key scholars here and expand their research networks?”,Scott Aalgaard, assistant professor of East Asian studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, says that even though Japan-centered research can and should continue during the border closures, the resulting research “will potentially not be as rich and impactful as work that can/does access ‘the field.’” He fears that “one of the byproducts of this shutting out of researchers is that we will necessarily fail to access a broad spectrum of voices,” resulting in a “skewed” view of Japan that is “curated by gatekeepers.”,
,The difficulty of gaining access to resources in Japan is causing scholars to change their research plans, and for some to completely abandon a focus on Japan, with tremendous potential impacts on the field of Japan Studies.,“After postponing my sabbatical three times, I’ve given up on entering Japan any time soon,” Ravina says. “I’m changing my research project to topics that 1) focus less on Japan, and 2) don’t require travel to Japan.”,Aalgaard says he is “urging students to think strategically about how they can go about their Japan-oriented research that doesn’t necessarily require physical access to the field/ground in Japan (via use of digital archives, social media platforms, Zoom, etc.).”,And, unfortunately, there are many who have simply given up.,“One of the biggest frustrations and sources of heartache for many researchers, their families and students over the past two years has been that they have repeatedly been told, ‘Oh just wait, just a little bit more, please just wait,’” Nelson says, “and they have never been given a clear sense of when they will be able to enter the country. Many of them are now finally fed up and have abandoned their fellowships.”,As a result, “We are about to see a tragic gap of maybe several years of research that was not done,” Nelson adds. “You are going to see a huge number of both undergraduates and grad students shifting away from a Japan track.”,“This whole crisis is impacting researchers and students right now, of course,” Aalgaard says, “but I suspect that the true costs of the state’s choices won’t really reveal themselves for another five or 10 years, when there’s a big hole in the group of individuals who could have been advocates for Japan and Japan studies.”,The Japanese government is “barring entry for the people who are so valuable to Japan, who passionately spread information and knowledge about Japanese literature and history and cinema, and all of these things that make ‘Cool Japan’ a thing,” Nelson says. “These are the people that the Japanese government is losing, and will continue to lose over the next couple of years.”,
,The scholars’ efforts to help their peers are proving a small bright spot in an otherwise bleak situation.,Kaitlyn Ugoretz, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has been unable to enter Japan, says that she was amazed to see a concerted effort by scholars to work together and generously offer support to people like herself.,“This is the first time that anyone proactively considered what kind of small thing they could do to concretely help stranded scholars, rather than the usual ‘thoughts and prayers’ or vague ‘let me know if there’s anything I can do’ sentiments,” she says.,Nelson has heard similar comments from others.,“So many people feel abandoned and ignored by their institutions, by the Japanese government, by different funding agencies,” she says. “Just to know that there is a group of people out there who do see them, who care about their research, and want to in some small way assist, that’s something. It’s good for them to know they aren’t completely alone.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Tucked away in the backstreets of Osaka’s Nishinari Ward is a guest house and cafe called Cocoroom. The building itself is a multicolored beacon to anyone looking for a friendly place to have a meal.,Inside, the shelves, walls and ceiling are lined with books, photos, art and lines of poetry — an almost overwhelming barrage of creativity. The staff and guests are gathered in the back kitchen and dining areas, chatting and preparing for the evening’s “,,” a communal meal that will start at 6 p.m. sharp.,
,On the night I am visiting, dinner is being prepared by a legally blind actress who cooks here once a week simply because she loves feeding people. On other nights, members of the staff and volunteers take turns cooking.,Cocoroom is a cafe … and an art space … and an NPO. How would the staff describe it?,“We don’t know (how to describe it), either,” says 49-year-old Tengyo Kura, a member of staff who plays interpreter for this Japanese-challenged writer. Something tells me it’s a role he’s played before.,Kura’s job description, like those of his coworkers, isn’t too clearly defined since everyone on staff helps out in many ways — for the benefit of both guests and the residents of Nishinari. Perhaps the best description for Cocoroom is that it’s a community.,
,Makanai serving bowls line the long dining table and tonight’s guests are digging in.,“This is ,. We made it here last year and froze it,” says Kura, pointing at one of the dishes. At the table are friends, family and strangers, people from all walks of life that are happy to be somewhere that doesn’t adhere to Japan’s societal hierarchies. Everyone addresses each other by their first names, and formal introductions are scrapped. Here, you learn about someone by engaging in a conversation.,
,
,“The relationship is very flat,” says Kanayo, the 52-year-old poet who founded Cocoroom with the aim of “relaxing people with food.” It’s her way of pointing out that everyone here is equal.,“I love you,” jokes Hiroki, 49, a Japanese nurse who lives in Thailand with his wife but has been unable to return home due to the current pandemic. The guests all laugh. Hiroki learned about Cocoroom after meeting Kura — or should I say Tengyo (we’re using first names now) — at a cafe that supports those with HIV.,Most of the guests have some connection to support services, and a sense of community is strong with people in Nishinari Ward. “Kamagasaki,” I’m corrected. The locals know this area as Kamagasaki, a place infamous in other parts of Japan for being populated by day laborers and the homeless. The government discourages the use of the name in the media, but the people at the table don’t seem to mind.,Cocoroom opened in 2003 as an art space and cafe, providing a neutral space for residents to discuss community issues. At that time, the venue wasn’t pulling in enough sales to pay the original staff, who were all artists, so Kanayo made it up to them with these makanai meals. Over time she came to realize that the act of eating together is also a form of expression, one of her main interests along with “human beings.”,“No matter who you are, you can’t live without eating,” she says. “If we practice ‘survival’ and ‘expression’ at the same time in our daily lives, it will one day become a culture.”,From one end of the table, frequent guest Hiroshi, 65, says he has been coming to Cocoroom for dinner since first hearing about the place three years ago. He lives alone and needs support after having suffered a stroke (he walks with a cane), so it makes him happy to come over for a daily visit. “It’s like having dinner with friends,” he says.,For Minoru, 70, dinner is a combination of friends and family. He is Kanayo’s husband after all.,“He’s a big figure in the community, but here he just does dishes,” Tengyo says with a friendly smile, reminding me of Cocoroom’s “flat relationship” and how everyone pitches in with the cooking and cleaning. Minoru is also something of a rebel: He was kicked out of college because of his activism and, since 1973, has been living in Kamagasaki and fighting for the rights of day laborers and the needy.,
,Someone attempts to sing. It is 35-year-old Eri, a return volunteer from Nagoya, who is trying to remember lyrics in response to a question about what everyone’s first album was. She’s back because volunteering here gave her skills and a sense of independence that did wonders for her mental health. Her singing is contagious, the other guests have started singing along to an old children’s song that Hiroki remembered from his first record.,Kanayo and Tengyo agree that people talk about everything at meals, from the serious to the downright silly. Clearly, freedom of expression reigns at this table. “Can I eat, too?” asks Tengyo, who has been translating for me all night. “Hiroki can help me, but his English is from Mars. I’m just kidding!” Even quiet Yuya, 24, laughs at that one. He was invited here by Tengyo after quitting his job as a systems engineer to pursue his passion for coffee. Tengyo is a friend of a friend, as well as a coffee connoisseur.,Tengyo is also a former teacher who has been moving around for the past 20 years working as a storyteller and artist, living the life of a “vagabond” (which is how he puts it). He was familiar with Cocoroom, both through artist and volunteer circles, as a “must-see place.” He wound up renting accommodation here last year after returning from Africa. Kanayo recruited him to do YouTube videos, among other things, a welcome assignment for a creative.,Having eaten his fill, Tengyo is ready for the next topic of conversation. I bring up what I think might be a sensitive subject — the reputation of Kamagasaki — but it doesn’t seem to bother anyone. The area got this reputation in part from the sporadic “riots” that take place there (“riots” is a term used by the Japanese media). The first such disturbance occurred in 1961 after an elderly day laborer was killed in a traffic accident and died after not receiving medical assistance. The most recent one coincided with the G8 summit held in Hokkaido in 2008.,Kanayo says safety in Kamagasaki is no different than in any other urban area in Japan, admitting she was once attacked and robbed here. She accepts what she calls “the rough and tough” that is part of the unique line of work as a trade off for satisfying her desire to create something that helps people. “People sometimes cry because they haven’t eaten with others in a long time,” she says.,
,
,It’s an interesting sentiment to consider amid the pandemic, too. Over the past two years, many members of the international community have been unable to return home to see their families. During the end-of-year holidays, this can be particularly lonesome. Kanayo points out that everyone is welcome, no matter their nationality. “Good will is enough” to be able to express yourself, she says.,Kanayo began writing poems at a young age. Later in life, one of her poet friends took their own life and, subsequently, Kanayo made it her life’s mission to create a place where anyone would be able to safely express themselves.,Cocoroom initially gave artists of all kinds a place to exist, and today it does much more: there are poetry workshops; the staff distributes , to the homeless; and there is a composting space in the garden that just received a colony of 1,000 earthworms. The list of activities is actually much longer, but the last guests are almost done clearing the table and it’s almost time for me to go.,“We want to connect strangers through meals,” Kanayo says. Eating together isn’t “just for satisfying ourselves, it is an invaluable experience that makes us feel alive.”,Given the two years we’ve had, that’s a welcome sentiment indeed.,For more information about Cocoroom, visit cocoroom.org.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,By now you’ve seen the news: The omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout Japan, with case numbers in almost every prefecture and major city sharply on the rise since the new year.,Also on the rise? A massive volume of information and speculation, often in Japanese, about how the country is planning to deal with the new variant. It’s times like these that a summary of what’s going on can be helpful — though it’s important to remember that the situation is fluid and likely to change.,
,Estimates show that upward of 80% to 90% of new cases throughout the country are, at present, the more infectious omicron variant of COVID-19. While the science and data point to an alarming trajectory, there are safe, consistent practices that you can take to protect yourself and your family.,
,First identified in Botswana and South Africa in November, omicron has spread around the world faster than any previous,COVID-19 variant. Now, enough scientific research has come in that we know a lot more about omicron than when Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tightened Japan’s border controls on Nov. 30.,The first thing that we know is that omicron spreads quickly. In fact, ,, the previous variant of concern. This has proven true indoors — household members were three times as likely to get infected from each other compared to delta — and across whole nations, as the omicron variant has swept across the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia.,We also know that ,. It has a ,, but can still cause deadly infections in some people.,Finally, COVID-19 vaccines are still effective against omicron — but with a huge caveat: Two doses from a vaccine administered more than three months ago help protect against severe illness, but not a symptomatic one. Booster shots protect from ,. However, boosters are ,, and it’s unlikely that anywhere close to a majority of the public will be able to get theirs in time to protect themselves from the current winter surge. Immunity from previous infection also ,.,
,Case numbers indicate that COVID-19 is once again spreading rapidly all across the nation. On Saturday, the national tally of new coronavirus cases recorded in a day hit 25,742, closer to the record 25,992 total Japan registered on Aug. 20 last year.,While case numbers here have remained a degree of magnitude lower than those in other developed nations throughout the pandemic, experts suggest there is nothing in particular about Japan that will ,. Rather, Japan’s large elderly population could contribute to greater rates of hospitalization than were seen in a country with a younger population such as South Africa.,Fortunately, Japan has counted less than three dozen COVID-19 deaths since December and still posts ,. In Okinawa, where an estimated 97% of new cases are due to omicron, most of the hospital patients were elderly people with underlying conditions and unvaccinated young people. Late last week, however, ,: an older man and older woman in Shizuoka and Chiba prefectures, respectively, both with pre-existing conditions from other diseases.,Yugo Shobugawa, a professor in the department of active aging at Niigata University, says it’s too early to say whether or not omicron will be less severe in Japan.,“In the data from the West, we saw few severe cases, but many have received their booster shots,” he says. “In Japan, most high-risk individuals will start their third vaccinations in February, so it’s unclear these shots will come in time.”,On Jan. 11, ,. The government plans to maintain its current border measures, preventing new entry of foreign nationals, which appears to have delayed but not stopped the entry of omicron into Japan. However, foreign residents and Japanese nationals ,.,The government is also working to secure more vaccine stock, administer vaccines to children over 12 and accelerate the booster vaccine schedule for older people by setting up mass-vaccination sites in cities. Other measures focus on keeping hospital beds available: Japan has worked to expand the number of institutions that support home treatment. While the government is ,, critics continue to emphasize that , will make the spread harder to keep in check.,Based on case trajectories abroad, Mitsuyoshi Urashima, a practicing pediatrician and professor of medicine at Jikei University in Tokyo, suspects that Japan should expect to see cases peak around Jan. 25 at an estimated 100,000 cases per day.,“There are many mild and asymptomatic cases, so many people won’t take PCR tests,” he says. “Since it’s more difficult to get tested for free in Japan, the number of COVID-positive patients may be underestimated.”,Shobugawa says it is unlikely that Japan’s contact tracing will be able to keep up with the spread.,“As essential workers fall ill or are isolated as close contacts, social services will experience disruptions unless the government changes its current isolation policy,” he says.,No large urban area has announced any new state of emergency. So far, Tokyo has done little but to ,.,
,
,So omicron is more infectious, but less severe. There are more border measures, but no lockdown. How does this change the decision calculus for an individual? , suggests it’s worthwhile to take a full step up in terms of caution: being more strict about mask-wearing and handwashing, and avoiding crowded bars and restaurants.,“The societal risk from omicron is quite high,” writes Sudhir. “Hospitals could fill up, even with a small percentage of vulnerable people who will all get sick at once, and health systems will be more likely to be overwhelmed as staff call in sick.”,Experts in Japan recommend sticking to the basics for dealing with omicron. That means continuing to stay at home when possible, avoid the “three Cs” (closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings), wear masks, ensure ventilation and disinfect frequently. It may also be worth investing in N95 masks, , are much better at blocking the spread of omicron compared to cloth masks. If you can’t get your hands on those, any mask is better than no mask.,“Omicron may be more infectious, but that doesn’t change the basic infection controls,” says Urashima. “However, due to the cold weather, closed windows will reduce ventilation, so be especially wary of poor ventilation.”,
,Omicron’s high level of infectiousness means that you’re much more likely to catch it without necessarily having close contact with a known infected person, says Shobugawa.,COVID-19 symptoms include: cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle/joint pain and a loss of smell and taste. With omicron, ,. The incubation period seems to be shorter, with symptoms showing on the third day of infection rather than the fifth — however, the period is not as short as with the flu, which also features sneezing as a symptom.,If you are experiencing symptoms or find out you were in contact with someone who is COVID-positive, assume you’ve contracted omicron and ,. From there, a doctor will determine if you need to be tested or not. In the meantime, remain at home until the test results come back.,In the case that you are positive, depending on your symptoms, , will determine whether you will remain at home, move to a hotel or visit a hospital. At the very least, stay at home and isolate yourself from the rest of your household if possible.,If you are staying at home with omicron, , masking indoors, opening windows to improve ventilation when possible, drinking plenty of liquids, and taking cold or flu medicine with painkillers to reduce symptoms. Severe chest pains, shortness of breath and persistent fever are signs to seek hospital care immediately.,Since the unvaccinated are particularly likely to contract COVID-19, they should make a special effort to prepare for how to manage their illness as well as contingency plans for managing work, family and child care. And with how infectious omicron is, this is a worthwhile exercise even for fully vaccinated individuals.,“Infections have been very low from October to December, so many have started to let their guard down,” says Shobugawa. “People should once again be conscious of safety measures. Most importantly, high-risk people should get their vaccines and boosters as soon as possible.”,The unique differences between omicron and previous variants can make deciding what action to take, if any, feel confusing. But the public safety message is clear: Take up your level of caution with increased social distancing and mask diligence, and prepare a contingency plan for you and your family in case of infection.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Many members of Japan’s foreign community come here to teach English. Some want the added experience of living abroad, some are looking to start anew in the country, and some are hoping to kick-start a lifelong career in education. No matter their situation, the pandemic has emphasized the precarious position many exist in.,The Japan Times spoke to a few of these teachers for an article titled “,” back in September. There, we discussed the pitfalls of vague contracts, a lack of paid sick leave and other issues that have caused serious burnout among educators in Japan and contributed to the country’s ,.,
,After contracts, the most frequent problem that arose in those discussions was a lack of teaching resources and support. For example, at many schools, teachers are expected to come up with their own curriculum, with few (if any) quality standards or opportunities to seek feedback. Those who become teachers here — or more often an instructor who assists a Japanese teacher in English-language classes — might find they are expected to adhere to a precise-but-outdated curriculum that emphasizes rote repetition and grammar structures over dynamic learning. Or worse, no curriculum at all.,“I was expected to come up with the curriculum as I went along,” says Elina Oi, a former teacher who worked at a school in Tokyo and then with private students. “It was all on me to come up with the curriculum and teach it, there were no guidelines and no support.”,Shireen Al-Zahawi, who has taught at a variety of international schools in Japan, tells similar stories about her experiences here.,“We had about a week to prepare the materials from scratch before the school opened for 2 year olds,” she says. “We didn’t have flashcards or books … the only things we had for our English class were crayons, chairs and tables for the kids.,“I had such a hard time getting things ready at the last minute for crafts and lesson-planning that I decided to work almost 11 hours (a day) for about a week or two just to get all of the materials ready two weeks ahead of time.”,Steven Thompson, a teacher with more than 20 years of experience in Osaka Prefecture, says that NETs (native English teachers) are expected to be competent enough to design lessons. However, many dispatch companies will hire native ALTs (assistant language teachers) or NETs with minimal teaching experience, leaving them hard-pressed to imagine how they, no matter how intelligent and enthusiastic they are, could come up with an adequate curriculum on their own.,Many schools, particularly public schools, currently find themselves struggling with budget shortfalls — not to mention the challenges of operating during a pandemic. This crunch has shifted the burden of creating the curriculum onto teachers, and that can have serious effects on quality of education, student interest and enthusiasm for the language, and teacher retention and burnout.,Some schools opt for a strict adherence to past curricula and instruct their educators to follow a pre-selected textbook down to the letter. This approach runs the risk of using textbooks and material that is outdated, according to Norihiko Inoue, regional sales and marketing director at Education First Japan.,“Most experts agree that the best way of teaching English is not to teach English, but instead to teach communication , English,” Inoue says. “For example, setting a theme, such as shopping, and then talking about what kind of language is spoken in shopping situations.,“But education in most schools across Asia is all about grammar — learning different grammar structures and perfect English, which is connected to the university entrance exam system. It’s very hard for Asian countries to change this format, because it’s part of a bigger structure.”,Further complicating matters are the differing objectives set out by the government and schools on a local level. The education ministry’s vision of how to teach English can sometimes clash with the objectives of parents, whose main goal is to see their children pass university entrance exams.,“The central ministry is aiming for communicative English,” Inoue says, “But exam English is not communicative, it’s multiple choice.”,Exams are also punitive, meaning students are punished for making mistakes. “English communication is not like that,” Inoue says. “It’s about trying new things and adding up the score, not subtracting.”,Teachers caught in the middle of this tug-of-war want to shift the curriculum toward communicative English, but face pressure to stick to less-practical exam materials. Teachers at public schools are also saddled with expectations to volunteer for extracurricular clubs, like English clubs, leaving even less time for curriculum creation and, in some cases, adding new obligations to create a “curriculum” for the club.,So where are things working? While private schools can be hit or miss for teachers depending on ownership and management, some have created a solid foundation for their teachers. Kaja Swenson, an English teacher in Nagoya, works at a small, family-owned school that offers collaboration and curriculum support, while still allowing teachers complete freedom to design their own lessons.,“Our school culture is very open, so we are constantly discussing activities and bouncing around our lesson ideas,” Swenson says. “This makes planning lessons completely doable in the time I have, and I feel confident in my lessons.,“At my previous position, this wasn’t the situation. We were given a very rigid curriculum to follow, down to the minute details. I felt less like a teacher, and more like a tool to administer a checklist.”,Thompson sees three main ways that English education can be improved in Japan: Ensure that English is taught in English, promote collaboration among English teachers to improve curricula, and strengthen the position of instructors with secure, longer contracts and paid sick leave.,Teaching in Japan can be a rewarding experience but, at the moment, you will likely need to do some extra work to meet your school’s expectations. With that in mind, several resources online can help. , on Reddit is a productive forum for asking questions. Sites such as , and , share comprehensive lists of blogs and guides on teaching and curriculum development, and joining a teacher’s association such as the , can also be helpful.,Challenges with English curriculum and teaching resources are contributing factors to Japan’s lackluster English progress over the years, and any teacher who has gone through the gauntlet may well agree.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,Whether he is studying at a vocational school in Tokyo or working at his part-time job, Lian Ceu is always worried about his parents.,His family, including a younger brother, are in Myanmar. They’re alive but were displaced after the family’s house in Chin State was destroyed by the country’s military during an air strike last September.,
,Showing a photo of the devastated site in Myanmar’s northwest on his mobile phone, the 26-year-old ethnic Chin says, “This is not what humans should do. The Tatmadaw takes this kind of action to instill a feeling of terror into people in an attempt to curb protests against the junta.”,Lian Ceu’s parents and 14-year-old brother are among an estimated 320,900 people who, according to U.N. data, are internally displaced across Myanmar due to clashes and unrest since the military, known as the Tatmadaw, detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and overthrew her democratically elected government in a coup on Feb. 1, 2021.,Of the total, 132,200 are in Chin and two neighboring regions, reflecting hostilities between the military and the Chinland Defense Force, an armed group of anti-coup protestors, which, together with other resistance forces, the junta labels as “terrorists” for undermining peace and stability in the country.,Critics and independent analysts, however, blame the junta for causing a humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, citing a U.N. estimate that the number of people requiring aid such as food and medical supplies will jump to 14.4 million — or about a quarter of the country’s population — in 2022 from 1 million before the coup.,The junta, led by army chief Min Aung Hlaing, has also killed about 1,500 peaceful demonstrators and other citizens, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a local monitoring group.,Speaking at Spring Revolution Restaurant in Tokyo’s Ikebukuro area on Jan. 9, Lian Ceu expressed his concerns.,“Every day, I’m worried that security forces may detain — or even kill — my parents and brother, claiming they have ties with the CDF even though they do not,” he said. “I won’t say where they are now but I’m concerned the Tatmadaw may conduct another air strike over them.”,
,
,A group of pro-democracy Myanmar residents in Japan opened the , last June with the aim of contributing to the cause of restoring freedom and democracy back home.,On that day Lian Ceu spoke in January, the restaurant served a buffet featuring ethnic Chin food, with the proceeds, including donations, to be used to help displaced people in the region, according to Lae Lae Lwin, a staffer who also works as a nurse at a Tokyo hospital.,“While enjoying Chin home cooking, I would like Myanmar residents in Japan from other ethnic groups to better understand the situation in Chin State and build a sense of solidarity among us in protest against the Tatmadaw,” said Lae Lae Lwin, one of about 32,000 Myanmar residents in Japan.,She and other restaurant staff also want Japanese customers to know what is happening in Myanmar, including the killing of nonviolent demonstrators, women and children, and seek effective measures from Japan to pressure the military to reverse course.,“The CDF is not a terrorist group as the junta claims,” Lae Lae Lwin, 31, said. “It involves students, doctors and nurses and other citizens, and members are fighting for peace, freedom, democracy and human rights.”,She was surprised — and very much encouraged — that one Japanese customer donated ¥100,000 ($870) to support the restaurant’s mission. The eatery is planning another event featuring local dishes of the Karen ethnic group, from eastern Myanmar’s Kayin State, on Feb. 13.,“Myanmar is a multiethnic country and decades of ethnic conflicts have made it difficult to create a genuinely inclusive federal state,” she said. “But we are now having a unique opportunity since the majority Bamar and ethnic minorities have joined forces in the fight against the junta.”,Lae Lae Lwin was referring to the National Unity Government, an organization launched last April by deposed pro-democracy parliamentarians, anticoup protest leaders and representatives of ethnic minority groups in opposition to military rule.,Led by Duwa Lashi La, an ethnic Kachin lawyer and former political leader of Kachin State, northern Myanmar, the NUG is demanding that the junta halt violence, release Suu Kyi and other detainees, and restore the democratically elected government.,Suu Kyi has been convicted on several charges, including incitement, a move her supporters and independent analysts say the junta intends to use as an excuse to legitimize the military takeover of the government and prevent the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from returning to politics.,Lae Lae Lwin and Lian Ceu are urging the Japanese government to recognize the NUG as Myanmar’s legitimate governing body and go beyond the suspension of new official development assistance projects, such as the withdrawal of all non-humanitarian aid and imposing sanctions on senior generals and the companies they control.,While applying pressure on the junta in concert with the United States and other countries, Japan — which unlike Western powers has ties with both the military and the NUG — is seeking to influence the generals without publicly humiliating them.,Such a strategy, however, has not been effective in addressing the crisis. No longer wanting to see violence and bloodshed in Myanmar, a country also hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Lae Lae Lwin and Lian Ceu called on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to side with Myanmar citizens and the NUG they support, not the military.,“The Tatmadaw has not only shattered my dream to develop regional areas in Myanmar through the hotel business, which I’m studying in Tokyo, but robbed my family of their home,” Lian Ceu said. “Until military rule ends, I have no choice but to work in Japan to support my family and NUG activity from here.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writers,How can contemporary theater affirm its raison d’etre at a time when going to see it live is viewed by many as an “unessential” activity? Even now, our third year in the pandemic, many arts events continue to be canceled, curtailed or forced to find other means of representation.,Theater Commons Tokyo (TCT), which kicks off its sixth edition today and runs until Feb. 27 at various locations in Tokyo’s Minato Ward and also online, addresses this problem head on with a program titled “Unsynchronized Voices.”,
,“The pandemic continues to forcibly synchronize the world,” writes Chiaki Soma in her note as TCT artistic director. “(Its) endless waves are akin to an omnipotent choreographer with the power to instantly overwrite our behaviors and gestures.”,This choreographed “dance” Soma refers to is one conducted through systems put in place by governments worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19, from social distancing and masking requirements, to border restrictions, vaccine passports and movement tracking. In an interview with The Japan Times, Soma explains that “the concept of ‘unsynchronized voices’ is not against government policies and protocols put in place to prevent the spread of the virus, but rather a chance to think independently of the control those measures exert on us physically and spiritually.”,TCT will present seven performance works and two forum discussions that not only offer radically different ways of creating, presenting and experiencing theater in the context of the pandemic, but challenge the very idea of what theater can be.,Among the three Japanese productions in the lineup, playwright and director Satoko Ichihara will present a new version of her play, “The Question of Faeries.” Ichihara was due to showcase “Madama Butterfly,” a co-production with Theater Neumarkt in Zurich, but it was canceled due to Japan’s current border restrictions.,“The Question of Faeries” was written in response to what is often referred to as the “Sagamihara stabbings,” when a former employee at a care home for people with disabilities in Kanagawa Prefecture killed 19 residents in 2016. The word “faeries” in the play’s title refers to mechanisms of discrimination that go overlooked in Japanese society.,The play is divided into three parts, each with its own particular dramatic form. Part one, “Ugly Woman,” draws on Japan’s , comedy tradition in a satirical take on the theme of beauty and ugliness. The second part, “Cockroach,” is a satirical musical that touches on issues of class, eugenics and anthropocentrism. The final part, “Mangurt,” is staged as a pseudo-seminar in which Ichihara questions the taboo status of female anatomy in traditional male-centered narratives of sexuality and reproduction, as well as the tendency to over-sterilize our environments. The latter theme is particularly resonant in the context of the pandemic.,Actress Tomoko Sato will deliver a performance in the form of a lecture titled “Index for Obake Tokyo: Chapter 1.” It will be a continuation of “Index for Obake Tokyo: Introduction,” which was presented at TCT last year. That lecture-performance pieced together references from literature, film, art, architecture and urban planning to construct an alternative plan of Tokyo from the perspective of , (ghosts).,Sato’s starting point was the 1965 treatise “Ghost Tokyo” by avant-garde artist Taro Okamoto. In the treatise, Okamoto sketches out the concept of , (polarism), which advocates maintaining the contradictions in human life rather than trying to resolve or dissolve them into a harmonious form. Thus, his “ghost” Tokyo is the conflictual and competing double of its real counterpart.,Sato brings the concept into the 21st century, reimagining the city against the backdrop of the pandemic, using voice, body, video projections and an array of innovative theatrical devices to rethink the present while also challenging the conventions of the lecture-performance format.,In “The Apocalypse of Women,” Kyun-Chome, a Tokyo-based artist unit comprised of Eri Homma and Nabuchi, asks what end-of-world narratives would look like if they were told by women. Drawing on extensive interviews with women in Japan from different walks of life, these visions of the future are packaged in mysterious parcels, which can either be picked up at TCT exhibition venues or sent to participants’ homes to be sampled until the end of March. The form this show takes is purposefully secretive, but if past installation works from Kyun-Chome are anything to go by, it promises to be evocative.,The remaining three works are by overseas artists. Shibaura House in Minato Ward will host “Suspended Delirium,” an installation by Berlin-based artists Monira Al Qadiri and Raed Yassin, in collaboration with media artist So Kanno. The piece is based on dialogues Qadiri and Yassin had as a couple living together during periods of lockdown in Germany. While many of their conversations revolved around the pandemic, they were also influenced by the major explosion that rocked Yassin’s hometown of Beirut in August 2020. The installation takes the form of three robots suspended in space with talking heads based on the two artists and their pet cat.,Also from Europe, the Dutch duo Suzan Boogaerdt and Bianca van der Schoot will present a lecture-performance titled “Traveling Without Moving.” The pair are known for creating works at the intersection of the performing and visual arts, real-world and virtual spaces. This new piece, which was commissioned by TCT, explores the theme of incubation, drawing on research into healing practices from East and West, the past and present, and asks whether theater can be a site for healing amid the pandemic era.,“One Another” is the umbrella title for a collection of video works and a lecture by Taiwanese artist, Hsu Che-Yu. The videos include “Single Copy” (2019), “The Unusual Death of a Mallard” (2020) and “The Making of Crime Scenes” (2021). In addition to the screenings of each of these recent works, Hsu will tie them together through a new research project on the interaction between animals and humans that is viewed through the histories of modernity and colonialism, but with a form that displaces anthropocentrism.,TCT will also host a workshop by Tokyo-based Reframe Lab, a collective of psychiatrists, curators, educators, interpreters and practitioners from the performing arts interested in the intersection between performance and care. Their workshop, “Nameless Games,” takes as its starting point the spontaneous games that children play, inventing worlds with their own stories and rules. The workshop aims to open participants’ own abstract or nameless worlds up to foster new modes of interrelation and understanding.,Rounding out the TCT roster are two forums. The first is on how to create “Unsynchronized Voices” in the arts and the second looks at the plurality of the world in the age of COVID-19 pandemic.,Soma notes that even though we are still in the midst of the pandemic and are therefore shortsighted as to its long term sociocultural effects, it is nonetheless crucial to engage with the here and now. “Unsynchronized Voices” is set to be a fascinating step in that direction.,Theater Commons Tokyo runs until Feb. 27 at various locations in Minato Ward, Tokyo.

			,Contributing writer,Hideki Ajima spent months preparing for this year’s “Sasuke,” adjusting his gym routine to focus on specific muscles that would help him conquer the famed obstacle course. The biggest challenge he faced, however, was a mental one.,“It was the wait before,” the 19-year-old performer currently part of talent agency Johnny & Associates Johnny’s Jr. group Shonen Ninja tells The Japan Times regarding his debut performance on the show. “While I was waiting for my turn (to run the course), I became hyper aware of just what my number was. Watching as other people fell and faced challenges made me think over how I had trained, what I had done and maybe not done.”,
,Anyone, even a J-pop performer, would be intimidated by the physical challenges laid out by “Sasuke,” which airs its end-of-year extravaganza on Dec. 28 at 6 p.m. on TBS. Since debuting in 1997, the series has presented celebrities and regular folks alike with challenging courses testing their athletic abilities, from jumps across pits to having to cross a balance beam through what looks like rotating punching bags — the “Fishbone.”,That’s just the first stage. True “Sasuke” legends make it all the way to the grueling fourth stage. If they complete that, they achieve “,” — an accomplishment awarded only 25 times in the show’s 24-year run.,The sheer challenge of “Sasuke” is one of the reasons the show has become a global cult hit, spawning 27 local versions around the world: from the United States, where it’s known as “American Ninja Warrior,” to Romania and Mongolia. In the world of intricate fan-maintained wiki projects, the “, features particular depth.,“I’ve been watching it on TV since I was little,” says Ryoichi Tsukada, a member of the group A.B.C-Z. “I’ve been doing gymnastics since the first grade, and I’ve always been confident when it comes to sports, so I had always wanted to try it out.”,Tsukada is the veteran “Sasuke” participant within the Johnny’s stable, having first tackled the course in 2015. The 35-year-old is one of four performers from Johnny’s participating in the 2021 edition of the competition. The others include first-timer Ajima; Snow Man’s Hikaru Iwamoto, with six previous appearances under his belt; and 7 Men Samurai’s Rinne Sugeta, who made his debut on “Sasuke” last year.,The Japan Times got a look at how the four pop stars trained for “Sasuke,” which has already been filmed, but we won’t know how they fared until the show airs. If they could tackle that obstacle course, though, then they are certain to stay strong when it comes to keeping spoilers under wraps. Hearing about the training sessions first-hand was enough to make me want to put an ice pack on my lower back.,To some degree, the Johnny’s participants have a leg up on most of us in aiming for “Sasuke” glory. The choreographed dancing and demands of performance mean pop stars need to be in good health, so all four were already routinely working out, with each noting an interest in fitness well before signing up with the agency.,“Before ‘Sasuke,’ I was mostly focused on weight training,” Iwamoto says, while Tsukada notes that he runs 10 kilometers at least three times a week, along with targeted gym days (legs, arms, back, etc.).,“When I found out in July that I’d be taking part in it this year, I changed my approach to training,” Ajima says. “I placed an emphasis on clearing the first stage, so as much as possible I focused on training my arms.”,The first stage of the course includes the dreaded “Dragon Glider,” which requires the competitor to leap up, latch onto a pole, glide forward down a track on said pole and then jump to a different pole, grabbing and gripping it.,Tsukada echoes Ajima’s strategy. “So I trained my forearms for the Dragon Glider — which I failed the very first time I was on ‘Sasuke’ — and then did lots of squats so I could get up the ‘Warped Wall.’”,Iwamoto says he started bouldering to increase his grip, as did Sugeta. “I wanted to strengthen my fingers, so I’d do those sorts of activities with friends,” says Iwamoto, who adds that this was done with the intention of advancing past the second stage, which he wasn’t able to do last year.,Even the fanciest Tokyo gyms aren’t likely to have a moat or warped wall, though. It takes a keen sense of strategy to figure out what exercises you’ll need to complete the challenges.,“It’s meaningless if you can’t use the muscles you gained training for ‘Sasuke,’” says Tsukada, who does something that hardcore participants — the type who become fixtures on the show year after year — all tend to do: practice on homemade versions of the “Sasuke” course. In Tsukada’s case, this meant traveling to other seasoned players’ homes and ,s. He filmed those experiences for the official “Sasuke” YouTube channel.,For all four, finding small ways to improve their strength and stamina during their musical activities proved vital. Sugeta says he stopped using elevators and ran up stairs as much as possible while working on a show at Tokyo’s Imperial Theatre — emphasizing the “running” part — while also finding ways to strengthen his fingers, primarily by hanging off of things.,“I’d find ways to just hang during productions and live shows,” Iwamoto says of his work-exercise balance.,No matter how much you train, though, that first day of filming is likely to produce the kind of jitters that Ajima felt while waiting for his turn to challenge the course. Sugeta says he remembers the feeling well, sitting there and watching the Fishbone take out other competitors before him was stressful even for someone used to performing in front of scores of fans. Tsukada emphasizes the importance of getting enough sleep and eating well before “Sasuke,” while Iwamoto is more aware of his well-being. “I’m very conscious of not accumulating too much stress in the two weeks leading up to the show,” he says. A lot of us may not ever tackle the “Sasuke” course, but this also might be good advice for those hoping to tackle a Mount Fuji climb next year.,“One of the most important things you have to do is create the feeling that you will not lose,” Tsukada says. “You , press the red button (that signals you’ve completed the challenge) at the end of the stage.” He adds that wearing the right shoes is also vital.,Ajima says that by the time his number was called, the nerves and self-doubt dissipated, and he felt better actually hitting the course. Like in any form of dedicated training, “Sasuke” participants tend to set goals: Clear the first stage in your first year, aim to complete the second stage in your second year. Though he still doesn’t let on how he actually fared on the course, he does say that he is already imagining more specialized training to help conquer “Sasuke”-specific challenges.,All four of the competitors say that taking part gives them a sense of achievement, which is empowering.,“The biggest thing I really felt was having accomplished something,” Sugeta says. “Specifically, accomplishing something as a result of one’s own ethics of hard work, drive and training. ‘Sasuke,’ and being a part of it, has really inspired me, which to me is the most important part of the whole experience.”,The ”Sasuke” end-of-year episode will air on Dec. 28 at 6 p.m on TBS.

			,Contributing writer,Looking for a love story this holiday season? Or perhaps you’d rather indulge in some messier romantic competition? Either way, streaming services have you covered with two Japanese shows that blur the line between reality and drama.,Netflix’s “The Future Diary,” which premiered on Dec. 14, aims to re-create the romance-fueled absurdity of a Japanese television drama in the real world. Two strangers are brought together and act out a love story guided by the titular book, which gives them instructions and prompts to further their relationship. The plots are ripped from familiar tropes on Japanese TV shows except for the fairy tale ending — in a truly melodramatic touch, the couple must say farewell at the end, even if they’ve fallen for one another.,
,The premise is one that originally debuted as the popular centerpiece segment of the late-1990s variety show “Unnan no Hontoko!”,The Netflix reboot, made in conjunction with TBS, focuses on Maai Nakasone from Okinawa and Takuto Wakamatsu from Hokkaido. The pair get to know one another in ways both familiar (coffee at a cafe) and ridiculous (forced to cook dinner for a boat full of impatient people). The Future Diary itself directs them, telling them things like when to have their first kiss.,Between segments, a panel of four Japanese celebrities — singer Daigo Naito, Exile member Taiki Sato, TV personality Saya and TV Tokyo announcer Reina Sumi — offer analysis of what they see. This is a format familiar to audiences in Asia but may only be recognizable to fans of the show “Terrace House” elsewhere. That show’s commentators were one of the best parts of the viewing experience, but on “The Future Diary,” at least for the first three episodes, their contributions are somewhat unnecessary.,Despite knowing how it all ends — the very first scene of the first episode shows Maai and Takuto tearfully accepting the fact that they have to say goodbye — “The Future Diary” is fun because it focuses on the romantic journey rather than the bittersweet result, and it makes for great comfort viewing. The real world might not resemble a rom-com, but Netflix can at least make it seem possible for 30-minute bursts.,Amazon Prime’s “The Bachelor Japan,” which premiered on Nov. 25, ignores the Japanese drama tradition in favor of the current American approach of turning everything into a contest. The show, now in its fourth season, follows the same beats as the U.S. version of the reality competition with women from across Japan vying for the affection of one man, this time a quadrilingual Chinese businessman named Kou Kou, taking part in various competitions to grab his attention. Similar to “The Future Diary,” a panel offers commentary in between the action, though the “Bachelor” crew — singer Rino Sashihara and comedians Koji Imada and Shingo Fujimori — is much funnier than the subdued cast “The Future Diary” brought together.,The series differ drastically in tone — “The Future Diary” aims to re-create a drama while “The Bachelor Japan” simply revels in it — but both don’t seem to kid themselves when it comes to the goal of providing entertainment. While centered around real people in the real world, the lovebirds on “The Future Diary” are basically improvising over a loose script, while “The Bachelor Japan” provides fantastical scenarios in a , — when was the last time you had to perform rhythmic gymnastics to get a second date?,We all just want a little love, even if you can see the entertainment industry strings holding it together.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Life in Japan slows down considerably during the new year period — ,, on Dec. 31, and ,, specifically Jan. 1, 2 and 3. So how do you fill this string of holidays? Why not stay in and watch some TV … it’s not like we’ve had too much of that over the past two years.,What sets this weekend apart from the rest of the year, though, is that you don’t need to binge a stream of videos on YouTube or catch up on all those Netflix shows you’ve been putting off for some quality entertainment. Japanese broadcast television’s slate of new year programming features star-studded blowouts that offer the perfect drip, drip, drip of moderately entertaining content to pass the time until 2022.,
,The most celebrated New Year’s Eve option remains NHK’s “Kohaku Uta Gassen” (Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m.), a music extravaganza that provides a snapshot of the year in music via a string of live performances. While not the ratings powerhouse it was in the past (many a Japanese grandmother will have the show on in the background during dinner), it’s still an incredibly popular way to count down the clock to midnight.,This year’s “Kohaku” balances heavyweights from the past with emerging new names, ranging from glum-pop purveyors Yoasobi to rockers Dish// to peppy popsters NiziU and more. Actors Haruna Kawaguchi and Yo Oizumi will take over hosting duties, and viewers can anticipate a slightly more progressive version of the show than what’s come in the past, as NHK has given the nod to shifting identity terms and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals in promoting this year’s edition.,Usually, the best counter programming to “Kohaku” is comedy duo Downtown’s “Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!” That comedy buffet of slapping and spanking, though, is done for good, leaving a big hole in New Year’s Eve lineups.,You could fill it with violence, thanks to Fuji TV’s Rizin special (Dec. 31, 6 p.m.), which finds a loaded card of MMA fighters walloping on one another. Or you could try to find some new funny stuff courtesy of TV Asahi’s “Zawatsuku! Omisoka” (Dec. 31, 6 p.m.), broadcasting for the third year in a row and offering “humorous commentary” on various social trends.,The bulk of comedy and variety specials air in the first few days of 2022. The closest thing to “Gaki” might be “Geinojin Kakuzuke Check” (Jan. 1, 5 p.m.) on TV Asahi, wherein celebrities form teams to face various challenges, with this year’s lineup including comedians, musicians such as Yoshiki from X Japan, and baseball manager-turned-meme Shinjo.,For those craving something more traditional, there’s Nippon TV’s “Shoten” (Jan. 1, 3 p.m.), which channels ancient entertainment for laughs. A day later provides more variety, via the TBS culinary special “Bananaman no Sekkaku Gourmet” (Jan. 2, 5 p.m.) and TV Asahi’s “Sports King” (Jan 2, 6:30 p.m.), which focuses on athletes. Or, take part in a long Japanese tradition by watching the Hakone Ekiden, a long-distance marathon that is held on Jan. 2 and 3, and which will be broadcast on Nippon TV from 7 a.m.,Among the most anticipated New Year’s programming are special episodes of popular dramas. The problem is, unless you are familiar with said series, it might be a bit too much to take in when you are just trying to stay warm at home. The one exception is TV Tokyo’s venerable “Kodoku no Gourmet” New Year’s special (Dec. 31, 10 p.m.). The show revolves around a worker who goes around, eats meals at real restaurants by himself, and comments on them. That’s it. And it’s perfect. The 2021 special finds the titular solitary gourmet embarking on a road trip to gobble up all kinds of delights. It’s perfect holiday fare to let wash over you, as you prepare to face 2022.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Sorry, fans of love stories! In the lead-up to the latest season of Netflix’s “Aggretsuko,” trailers teased a will-they-won’t-they relationship between main character Retsuko and her doofy but well-meaning co-worker Haida. Instead, the newest 10 episodes from the Sanrio-born property explore the crushing truths of the modern workplace and the angst of being a cog in the capitalist machine.,
,What has made “Aggretsuko” so popular since its debut in 2018 is how it offers a relatable and reflective take on contemporary life. The show revolves around a 20-something red panda named Retsuko who’s employed in the accounting division at a trading firm. She deals with tyrannical bosses, unreasonable amounts of overtime and a slew of other problems that are recognizable to young people currently trying to navigate Japanese corporate culture. After work she lets off steam by indulging in some death metal at karaoke.,It’s a simple premise that’s exceptionally entertaining, featuring compelling story arcs and characters you can empathize with. The third season saw Retsuko dabbling in the world of pop music, and wound up being a pretty engaging commentary on Japan’s idol-pop system. However, the fourth season, released on Dec. 16, ventures into some truly bleak storylines about how work influences our self-worth.,The CEO of Retsuko’s company — an old-school elephant out of step and obsessed with building a theme park while profits tumble — suffers a medical emergency, forcing him to step away from his position. A suave young director named Saluki Himuro is then brought in to guide the company forward.,His bold new approaches involve downsizing by implementing layoffs, especially of longstanding employees who have been with the company since the good ol’ days of the freewheeling 1980s bubble era. Retsuko’s oftentimes commanding supervisor, a pig named Ton, and a gossipy middle-aged hippo named Kabae both get the axe, and what follows are the grim realities of corporate life — forced resignations of workers over age 45, workplace bullying and the slow rot of office morale.,“Aggretsuko” does get around to the relationship drama between Retsuko and Haida, but even that developing romance hits a snag thanks to work woes.,Fortunately, the show’s compassion toward all its characters keeps things chugging along. “Aggretsuko” has always humanized even its most unlikeable characters, and the slow reveal of their redeeming qualities becomes a central theme over the course of season four. Saluki, who could have been written off as a heartless executive, is presented as doing whatever he can to save the company — it just happens to push him to dark and illegal places.,The show isn’t about bad behavior, it’s about toxic work environments grinding up employees and forcing them to extremes. That feeling is what makes the season hit hard, and when the final three episodes pivot to lightness, it’s comforting. (After watching Retsuko and her colleagues question their value and burn out on work, it’s a delight when we see Kabae wearing night vision goggles and shimmying through air ducts!),“Aggretsuko” season four is a notable addition to television shows offering dramatized insights into capitalism and how it affects the individual — an animated “Squid Game,” of sorts.,Come for the death-metal shrieks of a sweet-looking red panda, stay for the all-too-relatable sense of doing whatever it takes to stay afloat in the modern world.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

				,
			,The New York Times,Bob Saget, the stand-up comic and actor known as Danny Tanner on “Full House” and the host of “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” was found dead Sunday in Florida. He was 65.,His death was confirmed by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, which said Saget was found unresponsive in a hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes. The cause of death was not known, but the sheriff’s office said there were no signs of foul play or drug use.,
,Saget had performed Saturday night at Ponte Vedra Concert Hall in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, southeast of Jacksonville.,In a tweet early Sunday, Saget thanked the “appreciative audience.”,“I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight,” he said. “I’m happily addicted again to this.”,On “Full House,” Saget played a widowed father who shared his house with his three daughters, his brother-in-law and his best friend. The show, which aired from 1987 to 1995, launched Saget and his co-stars — including John Stamos, Lori Loughlin, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen — into the realm of household names.,Saget, born in Philadelphia, graduated from Temple University in 1978 before finding his way into comedy clubs. In contrast to his squeaky-clean image on “Full House” and “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” Saget delighted in raunchy, profanity-laden stand-up routines.,At Temple, he studied film, and the year of his graduation, he received a student Academy Award for documentary merit for his film “Through Adam’s Eyes,” about a nephew of his who had had facial reconstructive surgery.,But even then, he was already pursuing comedy. He told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2016 that, at 17, he won a local radio contest by singing a song about bondage, and that although he spent most of his time at Temple shooting film, he would also go to the University of Pennsylvania to do improv.,After graduating, Saget moved to Los Angeles and quickly made himself a constant presence at The Comedy Store. “I lived in that room for seven years,” he said on comedian Marc Maron’s podcast in 2010.,“I did jokes and some stories, but most of them were just silly, dirty silly,” he remembered. He said he was drawn to jokes with foul language and anatomy because it was what he wasn’t supposed to say growing up. “I stayed like a kid who just talked silly.”,He added, deadpan and possibly sincere, “I don’t curse for the sake of cursing, that’s the actual truth.”,After a brief stint on a CBS show, “The Morning Program,” Saget appeared in a 1987 Richard Pryor film, “Critical Condition.” He then got offered the part on “Full House.” He later joked with Maron, “My joke is, ‘Ask me my favorite episode?’”,“What’s your favorite episode,” Maron played along.,“The last one,” Saget said. Almost immediately, he added, “I’m the luckiest guy.”,Saget became the first host of “America’s Funniest Home Videos” in 1989, and although most of his commentary was in line with the character he played on “Full House” — funny voices and groan-inducing puns — his mordant wit sometimes slipped in.,In a statement Sunday night, the Saget family said they were “devastated” to confirm his death.,“He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter,” the family said.,In a tweet posted Sunday night, Stamos, who played Jesse Katsopolis on “Full House,” said he was “broken” and “gutted.”,“I am in complete and utter shock,” he said. “I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.”,Survivors include his wife, Kelly Rizzo, and three daughters, Aubrey Saget, Lara Melanie Saget and Jennifer Belle Saget.,After “Full House” ended, Saget directed a television movie, “For Hope,” that fictionalized the story of how his sister, Gay, grew ill and died of systemic scleroderma. (He later became a board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation.) He also directed a comedy starring Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange, “Dirty Work,” which was widely panned on its release in 1998.,Returning to the comedy circuit and mocking his wholesome TV alter ego, Saget developed a cult following as a comedian who could unleash torrents of scatological material. In 2010, he hosted a documentary series, “Strange Days With Bob Saget,” in which he spent time with pro wrestlers, bikers, Bigfoot hunters and others.,On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in 2017, Saget recalled how Don Rickles, a longtime friend of his and Stamos’, described his act. “He comes out like a Jewish Clark Kent,” Saget said, before launching into a song about a dog, a monkey and a verb repeatedly censored on network television.,But Saget never totally relinquished his family man persona: He voiced the narrator of “How I Met Your Mother,” an older wiser version of the show’s protagonist.,“My first thought was why can’t he do it? Or how much cigarettes and booze do you have to have to sound like me?” Saget told Larry King in 2014. But, he added, “I did it immediately because I read it. It was a love letter, it was a relationship show.”,

			,Staff writer,When I first heard that NHK was airing a show called “The Mating Game,” I assumed it was the national broadcaster’s answer to “Terrace House” — a beautifully shot voyeuristic look into the lives of young couples.,And in many ways I was right, except that, in “The Mating Game,” the human subjects have been replaced with infinitely more interesting specimens from the animal world.,
,Co-produced with Silverback Films, the U.K.-based studio behind David Attenborough’s “Planet Earth” series, “The Mating Game” (“Koi Suru Ikimono-tachi no Chosen,” in Japanese) follows the intricate, elegant and frequently deceptive courting rituals of 80 species in 22 different countries. It is also the first natural history series to be shot entirely in 8K.,“Grasslands,” the first of five episodes in the series, opens on a group of ostriches, almost 2½-meters tall and silhouetted against the arid backdrop of the Namibian savannah. As with any natural history documentary that Silverback Films is involved in, each shot brings to life the glorious detail of the scene, while also demonstrating the studio’s uncanny knack of being in exactly the right place at the right time to film the most intimate and unexpected of animal behaviors.,In an effort to woo one of the females, a gangly male ostrich takes to his knees and begins a surprisingly graceful courtship dance, swaying from side to side in an attempt to impress his would-be mate. Ultimately successful, the documentary pulls no punches in showing the intricacies of what follows, with little detail lost in the 8K format.,What makes the series even more impressive is that large parts of it were filmed throughout the pandemic.,“We had to cancel shoots in 18 locations,” says Taishi Inoue, one of the program directors, who filmed on location in the Dominican Republic and Kenya. “And we had to follow a detailed list of protocols to make sure that everything was filmed safely.”,“The Mating Game” is still rich in footage — from stunning aerials of zebra herds as they march across the savannah to extreme close-ups of a termite queen giving birth to thousands of larvae in quick succession, and jacked kangaroos fighting each other like testosterone junkies at a gym. At one point a “cross-dressing” bird enters the scene, disguising itself as the female of its species in order to outwit its male competitors.,Where the upgrade from 4K to 8K seems most noticeable is in the close-ups, as the skin of an animal ripples in its daily labors, or the air shimmers around it in the heat of the midday sun. The interplay of light across various natural surfaces — golden hour through dew-covered stalks of grass, the dim tunnels of an underground termite lair — all benefit from the upgrade in resolution.,“I think the depth of the image is totally different when compared with 2K and 4K,” says Inoue. “And the color is too, you can see the details even in the shadows.”,Ultimately, what really stands out is not the format, instead the sheer variety of the natural world, and the magnificent displays of beauty and cunning, as each species goes about its mating game.,“The Mating Game” premieres in 8K on NHK BS8K on Jan. 16 at 7 p.m. It will air on regular NHK channels later in 2022.

			,KYODO,Once an importer of “boys’ love” (BL) media from Japan, Thailand has now brought the genre full circle with its growing range of dramas themed on romances between impossibly beautiful young men.,
,
,Known locally as “Y series” — a reference to the Japanese term “,” that refers to works featuring homoerotic relationships between male characters — these homegrown dramas have been on the rise following the success of the 2016 Thai BL series “Sotus.”,
,But it wasn’t until the release of “2gether,” a 13-episode series about two handsome college boys who go from being in a fake relationship to falling in love, that the flame for a boom in Japan was well and truly ignited.,The show, produced by Thai television production studio GMMTV Co., debuted in February 2020 and soon became a hit overseas due to the “stay-at-home” lifestyle brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.,“One of the greatest draws (of the show) is that viewers can learn about a culture different to that of Japan, such as food and fashion,” says a spokesperson for Contents Seven Co., a video licensing company that promptly acquired the Japanese distribution rights for “2gether.”,While the Tokyo-based company had previously imported BL dramas from China and Taiwan, it decided to pick up its first Thai one when it saw potential in “2gether” even before it had aired. Through January, the series, which first streamed in Japan on Rakuten TV in July 2020, has been released on 13 domestic streaming platforms and aired on 10 TV stations.,Yui, a Japanese fan living in Bangkok, says she began watching Thai BL last May after hearing about its popularity in Japan. In no time, she was hooked.,“The first thing that attracted me to Thai BL was the beautiful faces of the actors. The more I watched, the more I found that the chemistry between the actors and their roles was so great that I was able to get emotionally involved,” she says, adding that it also presented her with a perfect opportunity to learn the language.,Yui, who first moved to Thailand in 2012, recently collaborated with travel company H.I.S. Tours Co. to take fans on a virtual “pilgrimage” tour to locations in the Southeast Asian country where some scenes in “2gether” were set.,According to H.I.S. Tours, the online tour held on Feb. 11 attracted over 250 people, nearly 99 percent of them women, with those in their 40s and 50s making up over 76 percent of participants. The event was so well-received that plans for future Thai BL tours are already in the works.,“We came up with the idea for the tour as we felt many people would want to see the locations, even at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult to physically visit (Thailand),” a H.I.S. Tours spokesperson says.,Japanese television and publishing companies have also jumped on board the Thai BL train. After announcing a business partnership with GMMTV in November 2020, TV Asahi held exhibitions in Tokyo and other major cities across Japan in collaboration with the studio throughout last year.,Meanwhile, major Japanese publishing company Kadokawa Corp. has been acquiring the rights to translate original Thai novels through its local subsidiary Kadokawa Amarin Co., officially launching its foray into Thai BL with the release of the Japanese edition of “Manner of Death” in January 2021.,Set in a fictional rural town in northern Thailand, “Manner of Death” depicts a romance between a forensic pathologist and a suspect in a murder case, offering a refreshing change from campus-based, vanilla themes typically used in Thai BL.,A drama adaption premiered on WeTV, the international streaming platform of Chinese IT giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., in November 2020.,
,
,The novel’s original author Sammon, a doctor by day, says it was “beyond (her) imagination” to be recognized in Japan, a country that produced the manga she grew up reading and from which she draws inspiration in her works.,“I really love Japanese culture, and now we can send something back for Japanese people to be able to know Thai people and Thai culture. I am very happy, and very appreciative as a Thai person,” she says, naming Ayano Yamane and Kou Yoneda as among her favorite Japanese BL manga artists.,“Manner of Death” also became one of the first Thai BL novels to be serialized into a manga by Kadokawa in March 2021, with Sammon working on the character designs with artist Yukari Umemoto.,“My dream is to go to a bookstore and to find my work, a Japanese ‘Manner of Death’ or ‘Grab a Bite’ (another of her BL novels) there, and then I will be so happy,” she says.,Thai government agencies are also pinning high hopes on a Thai drama sensation in Japan. Last April, the Thai Embassy in Japan held a “Thai Drama Festival” in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward, hosting virtual meetings with famous Thai BL actors, among other cultural activities.,The Tourism Authority of Thailand, which started a project to promote Thai BL in Japan in September 2020, hopes the trend will encourage more Japanese people to visit the country after the pandemic is contained.,“There are many people who started to become interested in Thailand through Thai dramas, and we hope they will come and experience the culture and charm of Thai culture for themselves once travel becomes easier again,” according to an official of the agency.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Bob Dylan sold his entire back catalog of recorded music along with “the rights to multiple future new releases” to Sony Music Entertainment, the company announced Monday, the latest high-profile deal of the recent music rights purchasing rush.,Sony did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. In late 2020 the iconic American artist had already sold his songwriting rights — separate from recording rights, which govern reproduction and distribution — to Universal, in a deal estimated to be worth more than $300 million.,
,According to industry reports including from Billboard and Variety, the latest Dylan deal was worth some $200 million.,Sony said it closed the recording rights transaction in July 2021, a tightening of Dylan’s six-decade relationship with the company.,The author of folk rock classics including “Like a Rolling Stone” and “Tangled Up in Blue” was signed to Sony’s Columbia Records in 1961, and recorded his debut album the same year.,Hailing the singer-songwriter’s “unrivaled genius,” Rob Stringer, Sony Music Group’s chairman, said “Columbia Records has had a special relationship with Bob Dylan from the beginning of his career and we are tremendously proud and excited to be continuing to grow and evolve our ongoing 60-year partnership.”,Dylan also lauded the agreement in a statement: “Columbia Records and Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records. I’m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong.”,Sony said it planned to collaborate with Dylan on “a range of future catalog reissues in the artist’s renowned and top-selling Bootleg Series,” a project that began in 1991 and has seen the artist make public more rare, previously unreleased studio and live material.,The terms also allow Sony to partner with Dylan “on additional projects.”,
,
,In 2020 Dylan released his 39th studio album — “Rough and Rowdy Ways” — to critical acclaim.,At 80 years old he continues to tour extensively, just Monday announcing a string of new dates in the U.S. South, part of a worldwide run slated to continue into 2024.,Dylan’s deal with Sony is separate from his blockbuster publishing sale to Universal.,The holders of master recording rights can dictate future reissues, while publishing rights owners receive a cut in a number of scenarios, including radio play and streaming, album sales, and use in advertising and movies.,The prolific Dylan has been covered countless times, making his songwriting catalog particularly valuable.,His publishing deal with Universal was one of the highest profile sales that preceded a flurry of music catalog transactions over the past year or so, as financial markets are increasingly drawn to music portfolios as an asset class.,The trend is driven in large part by the anticipated stability of streaming growth combined with low interest rates and dependable earning projections for time-tested hits.,It’s also useful for artists focused on estate planning.,Companies have acquired a number of major catalogs including from David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, Paul Simon, Motley Crue, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Shakira.,Springsteen sold both his publishing and recorded music rights to Sony for a staggering $500 million.,And earlier this month Bowie’s estate sold the late singer’s publishing rights to Warner Chappell Music.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,But reversing endings is rare, and there was widespread anger after censors replaced the original finale of “Fight Club” on a version streaming on platform Tencent Video.,In the original closing scenes, star Edward Norton’s narrator kills his imaginary alter-ego Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, before watching multiple buildings explode, suggesting his character’s plan to bring down modern civilization came to fruition.,But the version on Tencent instead closed with a line of text on a black screen to say the police “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals.”,In a rare censorship reversal, however, Tencent this week began to air the original conclusion of David Fincher’s film, including the iconic explosive ending that was trimmed last month.,The ending in which the state triumphs had sparked head scratching and outrage among some Chinese viewers — many of whom would likely have seen pirated versions of the unadulterated film.,Human Rights Watch described the cuts as “dystopian.”,Author Chuck Palahniuk, who wrote the 1996 novel that “Fight Club” was adapted from, tweeted that China had “done the right thing.”,Tencent did not reply to questions on what led to the censorship, nor its abrupt reversal, which prompted more debate online.,“Now, I’m speechless!” wrote one Chinese film fan, with the sentiment echoed across social media.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Ivan Reitman, a producer and director of a string of movies including “Ghostbusters” and “National Lampoon’s Animal House” that imprinted their antics on the funny bones of a generation of filmgoers, died Saturday at his home in Montecito, California, The Associated Press reported. He was 75.,His children, Jason Reitman, Catherine Reitman, and Caroline Reitman, confirmed the death in a statement to the AP.,
,During his decadeslong career, with credits as recent as last year, Reitman produced and directed major box-office comedies that became iconic to the generations that grew up with them and contributed to the rise of actors like Bill Murray and Arnold Schwarzenegger, whom he cast in the unlikely role of a police officer masquerading as a kindergarten teacher in “Kindergarten Cop” (1990).,He produced, with Matty Simmons, the 1978 movie “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” an hour-and-a-half-long depiction of Greek life’s chaotic energy and absurdity that has become one of the most beloved comedies in the history of the genre. The film injected the concept of the toga party into modern culture. After the staggering success of “Animal House,” he returned to directing, later telling The New York Times that he regretted not directing it.,His 1984 film “Ghostbusters,” which he did direct, was nominated for two Oscars, despite lukewarm reviews from some critics, who complained of disjointed humor that heavily prioritized special effects.,Viewers disagreed, enthralled and entertained by Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Murray clad in heavily accessorized jumpsuits and the bizarre visuals that included a 100-foot-high marshmallow dressed in a sailor suit and a neon green ghost. Five years later, he directed a sequel, “Ghostbusters II,” and he helped produce another spinoff, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” that was directed by his son, Jason, and released last year.,In a 2007 interview with the CBC, he recalled the first time he saw the three stars of “Ghostbusters” in their outlandish ghostbusting outfits, rounding Madison Avenue for a pre-shoot. “There was just something so extraordinary about that image,” he said. “I turned to the script assistant next to me and said, ‘I think this movie’s gonna work.’ ”,Ivan Reitman was born in Komarno, in what is now Slovakia, on Oct. 27, 1946, to Jewish parents who survived the Nazis. Four years later, his family fled Czechoslovakia to escape communism and eventually landed in Toronto.,“We came here penniless,” he told the CBC in 2007 as he was about to get a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame. “I didn’t speak the language.”,He began producing movies as a student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.,Working off-Broadway on “The National Lampoon Show,” he forged an early partnership with Ramis and with John Belushi and Murray before they became stars on “Saturday Night Live.”,After “Animal House,” he directed “Meatballs” (1979), starring Murray as the head counselor at a chaotic summer camp, and “Stripes” (1981), in which Murray plays a rebellious Army recruit.,Survivors include his children Jason, Catherine and Caroline.,“Our family is grieving the unexpected loss of a husband, father, and grandfather who taught us to always seek the magic in life,” they told the AP. “We take comfort that his work as a filmmaker brought laughter and happiness to countless others around the world. While we mourn privately, we hope those who knew him through his films will remember him always.”,

			,Kyodo,An exhibition showing 103 publicly unseen sketches by Japanese ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai will open at London's British Museum on Thursday.,The postcard-sized sketches were created by Hokusai (1760-1849) in the 1820s to the 1840s and were intended to become woodblock prints for a visual encyclopedia titled ""The Great Picture Book of Everything,"" which covered topics from the natural world to Buddhist lore and life in ancient India and China.,
,According to the museum, the volume was never published and the so-called ""block-ready"" drawings, or ,, were preserved in their original form.,At an advance viewing of the exhibit, curator Alfred Haft explained the chance discovery and expert investigation that brought the sketches to public view some 200 years after their creation.,Haft said that the sketches resurfaced at a small auction in Paris in 2019, attributed to a different artist.,Suspecting the drawings to be Hokusai's work, art dealer Israel Goldman approached the museum's Hokusai specialists and ""after consultation with experts worldwide, it was confirmed they were by Hokusai,"" he said.,The curator shared his delight at the works finally being displayed to the public, with the exhibit having been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.,""Hokusai was always reinventing himself as an artist and we are happy to be able to share in this as a discovery and a reopening of knowledge about Japan and Hokusai's life."",According to Haft, Hokusai represented the wide range of subjects in his sketches ""with equal facility and interest … he seems to be interested in everything."",Haft cited as a highlight an image of Taoist master Zhou Sheng ascending to the moon. ""(It's) a fantastic story of aspiration and achieving the impossible, which is what Hokusai did,"" referring to the artist's ambition to create a record of ""everything"" for the unpublished encyclopedia project.,The exhibit will run through Jan. 30.

			,Contributing writer,During the installation of this year’s Kyotographie international photography festival, which is currently running at various locations around Kyoto, an electric fan fell over at Nijo Castle, possibly leaving a slight mark on the wall of the World Heritage Site. For a few days it looked like one of the photography festival’s most impressive venues would be canceled.,One of the exhibitors, Richard Collasse, who is also chairman of the board at Chanel Japan, had things to say about the incident at his pre-exhibition talk. A tongue-lashing of Kyoto and Japan by a senior figure of a global fashion brand is not something you hear every day. While praising Kyotographie for being an important way for Kyoto to develop as a cultural center, he also castigated the city for being “the most closed society in a country whose spirit is still closed to the world.” That a small incident should blow up into such a huge issue was, in Collasse’s view, “a very Japanese problem.” The mainly Japanese audience that was present nodded and lightly tittered.,
,One reason Kyotoites might have been amused rather than offended by Collasse’s chastisement is that if you love where you live, an outsider’s frustration at your exclusivity isn’t a problem, it’s an affirmation. On the “love Kyoto” side, there is the artist couple and Kyotographie contributors RongRong and inri, who moved to the city six years ago. When I ask RongRong, who is originally from Fujian, China, what it was like to live in Kyoto, he says he would gladly stay forever.,“Being from China I felt a strong sense of continuity, through Buddhist tradition, connecting Kyoto to my own roots,” he says. “Other than that, the air, the smells — things that can’t be put into words — this is Kyoto for me.”,Taking into account that Kyotographie is an international festival and provides access to Japan’s ancient heritage shows that Kyotoites are at least willing to share on occasion. And with reports of a budget crunch in Japan’s crown jewel, an artistic festival is a pretty on-brand way to do so.,
,
,In recognition of the ongoing pandemic as well as the 10th anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake, Kyotographie’s theme this year is “Echo.”,As such, one of the centerpiece exhibitions is Dutch photographic artist Erwin Olaf’s “Annus Mirabilis,” which combines two series created during the pandemic. Located at the Museum of Kyoto Annex, the first of the series, “April Fool,” reflects the absurdity of life in lockdown. The second, “Im Wald” (“In the Forest”), is an extraordinary demonstration of what digital photography can do in terms of creating vast and impeccably detailed images with perfect exposure. The impact of Olaf’s images is enhanced by the complementary design of the exhibition, which takes us from dark claustrophobic corridors showing “April Fool” into an expansive white space for the “Im Wald” section. The whole thing is visually seductive, but the easy and deferential recycling of 19th-century painterly aesthetic seems regressive rather than contemporary.,The five exhibits at the almost-canceled Nijo Castle venue include Kazuma Obara’s “Fill in the Blanks,” which uses different recording techniques to remind us that in major disasters there are many individual stories of suffering. Ikebana master Atsunobu Katagiri’s “Sacrifice” uses the type of black bags used to store irradiated soil, placing inside them photos of simple ikebana designs created using materials from Fukushima Prefecture, which suffered a nuclear disaster after the Great East Japan Earthquake. In the video of “Brise-lames” (“Wind-waves”), by choreographer Damien Jalet and French street artist and photographer JR, dancers’ bodies undulate in tortured waves. Chikuunsai IV Tanabe has woven strips of recycled bamboo into a huge organic shape that overwhelms the room in which it has been installed. In the context of Kyotographie, the work is a threatening nonhuman presence with which the viewer must negotiate the right to coexist.,And in one of the castle watchtowers, Collasse’s own photography of the March 11 disaster is presented with words from his novel “L’Ocean dans la Riziere” (“The Ocean in the Ricefield”), which also centers on the tsunami. While introducing his exhibition, Collasse humbly described himself as a lover of photography rather than an artist, but with a superbly designed installation, erected in just a few days, the total effect of viewing his images is powerfully emotive. This is representative of the strength of Kyotographie as a festival as well as its weakness, in that the beauty of the setting may blunt a work’s critical potential.,
,
,Over at the Hosoo Gallery, the Maison Europeenne de la Photographie (MEP), in conjunction with the global luxury group Kering, is presenting a selection of work by five early-career female photographers. Manon Lanjouere’s “Demande a la poussiere” (“Ask the Dust”) is a collection of faux-archive and constructed images that mixes the dramatic, poetic and forensic with particularly fine judgment. Inspired by a natural disaster and a piece of music by John Adams, Lanjouere’s work evokes a creeping sense of dread and awe that fits powerfully with the “Echo” theme. Another standout work in the MEP selection, though not a photography project, is Adele Gratacos de Volder’s combination of tiny scribbled handwriting and fever-dream video piece “Jamais Indemne! Un Coeur a Corps” (“Never Unscathed! A Heart to the Body”).,Other non-photographic works in this year’s festival include David Shrigley’s “Unconventional Bubbles,” the output from a collaboration with the Champagne maker Ruinart, and “Miroirs” (“Mirrors”) a manga by Kaiu Shirai and Posuka Demizu that is inspired by the life of fashion designer Coco Chanel.,With panels that portray, for example, a sign reading “Please do not destroy the world” and an oval Earth with the text “World has been distorted — we must return it to its original shape,” the Shrigley work chosen for display does not quite capture the esoteric and multivalent humor of the British artist. The “Miroirs” exhibition, however, is beautifully set up in a traditional obi workshop and attached storehouse from the Taisho Era (1912-26), and tells a story of grit and liberation through self-expression. Don’t expect any mention of Chanel’s Nazi sympathies, though.,
,
,In the KG+ Select satellite program, which is intended to incubate new talent, the project “Saori” by Taro Karibe, takes a nonjudgemental look at 65-year-old Senji Nakajima and his life with a silicone sex doll named Saori from 2016 to 2020. Although Nakajima is married with two children, he has lived away from home due to work since the age of 40. Karibe’s gaze is largely a sympathetic one, showing Nakajima taking care of Saori — when he takes her outside he puts her in a wheelchair — as well as enjoying her sexually as an object. According to Karibe’s accompanying text, which references the work of “Love and Sex with Robots: The Evolution of Human-Robot Relationships” author David Levy, “Saori” is underpinned by the question, “What makes us human?”,Karibe’s moral equanimity toward his subject’s situation is understandable, but in the context that the treatment of mental health issues in Japan — including loneliness — mostly focuses on ameliorating symptoms, rather than seriously engaging with causes, the question “What makes us human?” is rather sophomoric. Yusuke Takagi, another artist in the KG+ Select program, asks a harder question in his work, “Spin”: How can I break the cycle of my father’s behavior and have a better relationship with my son, more than what my father had with me?,Using old family photos, enlarged versions of his photography and colored patterns derived from CT scans that show his father’s brain atrophy brought on by chronic alcoholism, Takagi’s images owe something of their style to the postwar avant-garde of the Provoke era in Japan. His photobook of the project, however, is powerfully unique.,Catharsis is a key point in Takagi’s work, and important to the festival as a whole, particularly this year. However, photography’s superpower is to critique narratives, even if it is particularly good at creating or confirming them. Kyoto has long thrived on its narrative as being insular, and Kyotographie, simply by existing, has a major impact on that.,Kyotographie 2021: Echo is currently taking place at various locations around Kyoto until Oct. 17.

			,The New York Times,In the latest sign of the disruption underway in the art market amid the pandemic, three powerful alumni from Sotheby’s have joined forces to create a new company that will focus on the rapidly growing pool of buyers in Asia.,Amy Cappellazzo, former chair of Sotheby’s fine art division, and Yuki Terase, former head of contemporary art in Asia, in November will begin operating an international art advisory firm that handles transactions and offers market expertise, advising on the acquisition of works of art or the dissolution of collections.,
,Adam Chinn, another founding partner and Sotheby’s former chief operating officer, will handle the company’s business and legal operations.,The market for major collectors in United States is largely saturated, Cappellazzo says in a joint sit-down interview. “They have so much already that they are only buying to fill in,” she explains, “whereas when you get a whole crop of new collectors, they’re much more voracious, because they’re starting to build something.”,“The only smart thing to do,” she adds, “is to build a business that can multitask.”,The company reflects several changes in the market, namely collectors’ increasing comfort with buying art they haven’t seen in person (through online sales or from emailed PDFs) and a rising interest over the past five years among Asian buyers in purchasing works by Western artists.,During the pandemic, when people could not travel and avoided in-person activities, buyers have been forced to trust the due diligence of condition reports, catalogue raisonnes and photographic representations, Cappellazzo says.,The company, called Art Intelligence Global (AIG), will be headquartered both in Hong Kong — where Terase will be based and where the offices are to include a large exhibition space — and in New York, at the former home of the storied Pace/MacGill Gallery, where Cappellazzo and Chinn will move in early next year. (They will work remotely until then.),The equal footing of both offices reflects a recognition that, over the past five years, the Asian market has become hugely important — surpassing Europe as the second largest in the world after the United States, the team says, and fueled by young buyers from the fields of technology and entertainment in places like Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.,“Asia is really at the point where it can originate this kind of world-class success and expertise in the region, not something that’s imported from Western organizations,” Terase says. “It’s become such an important market to determine even how you structure New York sales.”,Over her decade at Sotheby’s, Terase — who previously worked in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo — helped build the Asian presence of U.S. auction houses, starting with a Hong Kong pop-up auction in fall 2016.,“That was really the first time that any international auction had offered Western art in the main auction series,” she says. “At the time, no one believed in consigning great pieces to Hong Kong — they said collectors will come and buy in London or New York.”,Earlier this month, Sotheby’s five modern and contemporary Hong Kong sales totaled $185 million, bringing the year-to-date total in those categories in Asia to $600 million, a 35% increase over 2020.,In addition, 40% of Sotheby’s last four evening sales — and nine of the top 20 pieces that sold there in 2020 — went to Asian buyers. Major collectors of Western art include Asians such as Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou.,Cappellazzo came to Sotheby’s when her advisory firm, Art Agency, Partners — managed with Allan Schwartzman, a longtime art adviser, and Chinn, an investment banker and lawyer — was acquired by the auction house in 2016.,She previously spent 13 years as chair of postwar and contemporary art development at Christie’s and began her career as an art adviser and curator.,In addition to his role at AIG, Chinn will continue as a co-chair of LiveArt, an art trading platform he helped found in June.,AIG is not the only new partnership casting an eye toward Asia. It echoes the recent merger of four prominent dealers, announced in August: Dominique Levy, Brett Gorvy, Amalia Dayan and Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn. Starting in January, their company LGDR will represent artists and organize exhibitions while also advising collectors and brokering auction sales — but attend art fairs only in Asia, where they say such gatherings remain an important gateway to a wider array of young collectors.,The AIG team, while providing a broad range of services, will advise Asian clients on promising new collecting areas, such as NFT’s — which Cappellazzo said she believes are “here to stay” — and works by artists of color, a category that has exploded.,In Hong Kong, Basquiat’s sword-brandishing “Untitled (Red Warrior)” brought about $21 million last week; in June, his triptych sold for $37.2 million; and in March, another Basquiat warrior painting brought $41.8 million, a record high price for Western art in Asia. Last week, a recent painting by Ghanaian artist Amoako Boafo, “White Hat White Shades,” sold for about $680,000, well over its estimate.,Edward Dolman, executive chair of Phillips, an auction house, says the new company made sense, given that Asia is “the fastest-growing area of the market,” and adding that to build its presence in China, Phillips recently started partnering with Poly Auction in Hong Kong.,Christie’s, for its part, is building a new headquarters in Hong Kong and has been hosting non-selling exhibitions to promote Western art in Asia. “One-third of our transactions are now with clients in Asia,” says Marc Porter, Christie’s chair, Americas. “In the same way that the art business had to expand from London and Paris, we have the same responsibility now in Asia. It’s a beginning of a trend for the century.”,Cappellazzo says she had long admired Terase, having collaborated closely with her at Sotheby’s. “There is no one I’ve worked with that talented,” Cappellazzo says, “whose art historical range is that nimble.”,The three partners’ skill sets, Chinn says, “take you from soup to nuts on any transaction.”,As to whether they would collectively eat into the business of art advisers, auction houses or art dealers, the team says their business was additive. “We’re making the pie bigger,” Chinn says. “There is so much opportunity left in the market.”,

			,Contributing writer,Situated in the city of Rueil-Malmaison, about 15 kilometers west of Paris’ city center, the picturesque Chateau de Malmaison was once home to one of France’s most famous couples: Josephine de Beauharnais and Napoleon Bonaparte.,Although the historic estate changed hands over the years, it is now a national museum dedicated to the memory of the emperor and his wife, and to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Napoleon’s death, Japanese artist Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, who goes by just her first name, was asked to create a collection of tableware inspired by the couple. Her exhibition, “Regardes de Setsuko” (“Through the Eyes of Setsuko”), ran from Oct. 26 until Nov. 15.,
,Five years before Napoleon became the emperor of France in 1804, de Beauharnais purchased the chateau and put great effort into transforming the rundown manor and surrounding 150 acres of meadows and trees into what she later described in a letter as “the most beautiful and curious garden in Europe, a model of good cultivation.”,That is why Isabelle Tamisier-Vetois, Chateau de Malmaison’s head of heritage conservation, knew that the estate’s verdant beauty had to play a key role in the anniversary celebrations. She realized that Setsuko, known for her sculptures and paintings, was the perfect artist to work with after seeing her 2018 show at Paris’ Gagosian gallery, “Into the Trees,” which featured glazed terracotta trees alongside her bronze works.,“Setsuko’s hollow trees, where life is reborn, invited us to hide and daydream,” Tamisier-Vetois says. “We were then seduced by the patinated bronze candle holders and immediately imagined collaborating with her for the museum.”,
,
,Setsuko’s past works also captivated Thierry Boutemy, a French florist known for the arrangements he created for Sofia Coppola’s 2006 drama, “Marie Antoinette.” Boutemy discovered Setsuko’s art during a trip to Switzerland, where he visited the Balthus Chapel near Setsuko’s current home and watched documentaries on the Japanese artist and her family.,“She came to Europe as a young woman and mastered an idea of beauty that transcends cultural boundaries,” says Boutemy, who traveled from his base in Belgium to offer his floral arrangements for her exhibition at Chateau de Malmaison. “You can definitely see the refinement of the two cultures in her works, but she does not enforce Japanese ideologies in an obvious way.”,On the exhibition’s opening day, a ceramic olive tree crafted by Setsuko greeted the guests at the chateau’s entrance. In the adjacent dining room, French ceramic brand Astier de Villatte, a longtime collaborator of Setsuko’s, presented dishes on a wooden dining table to complement her tableware depicting deer as a reference to de Beauharnais’ farm at the chateau and the Butard Pavillion hunting lodge in Versailles. The empress had ordered the latter to be depicted on her 1808 dining ware titled “Wild Deer Hunting in the Butard Woods.”,“Another work I created for this occasion is a decorated bowl held by the hands of Josephine,” Setsuko says. “I asked Tamisier to show me the wedding band Josephine was given by Napoleon, and it was a very modestly designed gold band, not like the big diamond rings we see today. I found that very inspiring.”,“The attraction to nature that Josephine had, her passion for botany, is easily found in Setsuko’s artworks,” Tamisier-Vetois adds.,The artist agrees that nature is an integral part of her creations. “I am constantly working with nature. I sculpt using terracotta, I paint with natural pigments and I need fire for my bronze works,” Setsuko says. “When I was studying ikebana as a young girl, I learned that it is about taking the responsibility of a flower’s life. Along with the shared ,(subtle) or ,(transient/imperfect) values of Japan and France, it’s the respect for nature I carry with me that attracts various audiences to my works.”,Her connection with the former French rulers, however, goes beyond a shared affinity for nature. In 1967, the artist and her husband, the Polish-French modern artist Balthasar Klossowski de Rola (better known as Balthus), were sent to Italy by France’s minister of cultural affairs. The pair moved to the Villa Medici, a grand residence previously owned by the Medicis that was turned into an art academy by Napoleon in 1803.,“(Villa Medici) was a French territory within Rome that was created to accommodate France’s prized painters,” Setsuko says. “My first home in Europe was this artists’ villa established by Napoleon.”,As director of the French Academy in Rome, Balthus restored the estate by dismantling its lavish 19th-century decorations and stripping down the golden walls to reveal the original handmade textures beneath. During this time, Setsuko realized that the concept of appreciating imperfection and transience existed outside of Japan as she watched Balthus strip away modern decorations to reveal the passage of time. “That’s where I learned about the global appreciation for wabi-sabi. We all find beauty in the nostalgia triggered by imperfection,” she says.,
,
,Setsuko crossed paths with Napoleon’s legacy once again many years later.,“Pierre Carron was a dear student of Balthus at Villa Medici and I’d watch Pierre’s baby, Benoit Astier de Villatte, play in the garden,” she says. “Decades later, I heard of a magnificent ceramic store called Astier de Villatte and I remembered the baby Benoit! From there, Benoit and his partner, Ivan Pericoli, took me to their rustic boutique near the Louvre, which used to be a goldsmith workshop for Napoleon’s crowns.”,Setsuko soon began working with Astier de Villatte and Pericoli, opening her ceramic studio in their Paris factory. “Their handmade ceramics are extremely fragile and are like delicate watercolor paintings,” she says.,Astier de Villatte also understands that “Japan’s concept of wabi-sabi transcends time and cultural boundaries,” Setsuko adds, noting that Japan and France share a deep bond stemming from an appreciation for the same artistic values that goes back centuries.,“It is a bond of kinship born of the same love of beauty from Japan to France that has never stopped since the Meiji Era (1868-1912),” says Setsuko, referring to Japonisme, an art movement that swept through France and influenced many Western European artists in the latter half of the 1800s.,Her recent exhibition is also a demonstration of that kinship. “The exhibition’s opening was postponed several times due to the pandemic, but the genesis of the show was to create a bridge between the past and today, and France and the world,” Tamisier-Vetois says.,With her deep understanding of the connection that Japan and France share, Setsuko has indeed created such a bridge and brought the artistic legacies of Napoleon and de Beauharnais to life.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Fortune was unfair to Tsukioka Kogyo. A gifted draftsman with an acute sense of the expressive power of color, he had talent galore. Had he been active in the first half of the 19th century, when ukiyo-e enjoyed its heyday, his work might have gained broad recognition. Alas, Kogyo was born late, in 1869, when the art form was already in decline. By the time he entered his artistic maturity in the 1890s, it was on its last legs. Today, his name is largely forgotten.,This was no fault of his own. For much of the Edo Period (1603-1868), woodblock prints had enjoyed unprecedented popularity. They were used to reproduce text and images for books, commercial advertising, playing cards, votive images and even board games. By pushing the technology to its limits, the most accomplished craftsmen were also able to produce spectacular single-sheet polychrome prints that were admired for their artistic qualities and avidly collected by enthusiasts.,
,Things began to change in the late-1850s when Japan opened its borders and gained access to Western technology. New media — photography, oil painting, magazines and newspapers — flooded in and gradually pushed aside older forms such as woodcuts. To succeed, budding artists like Kogyo needed a niche.,Kogyo chose noh. For three decades, from 1897 until his death in 1927, he produced the most comprehensive visual body of work dedicated to Japan’s oldest living form of theater. Such prints had been made before, but they were rare and often sold privately. By comparison, Kogyo designed at least 580 images that, by some estimates, amount to as much as 75% of his entire print production. In either quality or quantity, his output in the noh genre, which also includes paintings, is unparalleled.,
,
,However, few people outside of noh circles are familiar with his work, says Rei Yamauchi, a curator at the Nakagawa-machi Bato Hiroshige Museum of Art, which is located in Nasu, Tochigi Prefecture. This is partly why the museum decided to present, for the first time, all 68 prints of its Kogyo collection. This is the first such exhibition in Japan in years, perhaps even in more than a decade. The show runs until March 27.,With 45 pieces on display, the focus of the exhibition falls squarely on “One Hundred Noh Plays,” a series that Kogyo and his publisher began releasing a century ago this year. It is also considered his best and most representative. Particularly remarkable is the manner in which brush strokes are transferred onto print to preserve a painterly feel, something that is highly unusual in ukiyo-e. Dyes are delicately applied throughout, often evoking the evanescence of watercolor. In some places, they suggest shadows or foliage. In others, such as in the disheveled hair of a , or ,, two types of noh actors, they indicate envy or fury.,The visual impact is memorable, but Kogyo’s talent goes beyond aesthetic considerations. J. Thomas Rimer, an emeritus professor of Japanese literature at the University of Pittsburgh, spent much of his career studying noh. Over email, he suggests that a large part of Kogyo’s genius resided in his “ability to evoke the emotion found in the text of a particular play, through his poetic rendering of a central image chosen in order to visualize a range of emotions embedded in the play as a whole.” Kogyo could wield brush and pathos with equal dexterity.,Scholars are still unable to fully explain how and why Kogyo developed his near obsessive passion for noh. He left neither diary nor letters explaining his motives, so we are left with conjectures. But one possibility is intriguing — that Kogyo, concerned about the long-term survival of this form of theater, was trying to raise its profile and expand its appeal. The theory holds water: In the decades that followed the Meiji Restoration in 1868, it almost disappeared.,From its popular roots in the 14th century, noh evolved under the Tokugawa shogunate into a theater of the samurai and clerical elites. Together, they formed a powerful, albeit relatively small, support base. Beyond this circumscribed circle of aficionados, noh actors were seldom recognized. In this respect, they differed from their peers of the kabuki stage, many of whom were celebrated with gusto in popular fiction and ukiyo-e. “Noh actors often wore masks,” says Kendall Brown, a professor of Asian art history at California State University Long Beach, “so they did not engender the same kind of fan appreciation lavished on handsome or winsome kabuki actors.”,The shogunate had no problem with that. Although canonical versions of noh plays were widely available, their study, as well as the practice of noh chanting and dancing, was discouraged by the authorities. More importantly, performances were almost invariably held away from the gaze of commoners, in daimyo’s residences or on the shogun’s palace grounds. Only on rare occasions, say when a temple short of funds resorted to putting on a performance to fill its coffers, were the plebes able to attend.,This arrangement unraveled with the fall of the Tokugawa regime in 1867. Almost overnight, patrons vanished, funds evaporated and troupes disbanded. Many actors fell into penury while others left the profession entirely. In time, however, it dawned on the new Meiji government that noh, like opera in the West, could be helpful to shore up Japan’s cultural standing, and they began sponsoring plays. This was an important turning point. Only then, Brown explains, was “noh finally decoupled from warrior culture and prints about it could start appearing in large numbers.”,It was around that time, in 1883, when Kogyo was in his mid-teens, that he saw his first noh play, “Shakkyo.” He would illustrate it many times, including as a diptych in “One Hundred Noh Plays.” Kogyo , about his first thespian encounter, but it is likely it made quite an impression.,Kogyo began his artistic training in a traditional way. At age 12, he was sent to an uncle to study pottery painting. A few years later, he moved to a prefectural school that specialized in making crafts using glass, ceramics and stone. He remained there for three years and acquired the basic skills he needed to earn his keep.,He had become a craftsman, but he was not yet an artist. That came later, after he completed two apprenticeships: first with Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1839-92), his stepfather from 1884 and one of the most celebrated painters of the entire ukiyo-e tradition, and then with Ogata Gekko (1859-1920), from whom he received his artist’s name. Soon after, Kogyo began showing his paintings at exhibitions sponsored by the government or within trendy artistic circles. He won several prizes, but never broke out in a big way.,Decades after his death, Kogyo remains an obscure figure — but this could change. According to Yamauchi, scholars have begun reassessing the legacy of Kogyo and other early-20th-century artists. Whether this will result in greater public recognition remains to be seen, but Kogyo might not have cared anyway. What mattered to him was the survival of his beloved noh. He would be pleased to see it is alive and well.,Tsukioka Kogyo’s works will be on display until March 27 at the Nakagawa-machi Bato Hiroshige Museum of Art in Nasu, Tochigi Prefecture.

			,Contributing writer,Yoshiaki Imai was working in Kyoto as a director for TV when his job sent him to Kawayu Onsen for the first time.,It was the early 1990s and the town, located in eastern Hokkaido’s Akan Mashu National Park, was to be the subject of a program focusing on the area’s natural , (hot springs).,
,Imai, a native of Shiga Prefecture, found himself deeply attracted to the region’s raw nature and subsequently decided to build a second home nearby Lake Kussharo, where he began spending his holidays. He had briefly considered relocating to Kyushu’s Yakushima Island, but realizing he needed a more permanent change, he finally opted to move to his Lake Kussharo home in 2000. In addition to the region’s low cost of living, Imai was attracted to the artistic possibilities offered by its dramatic scenery.,Kawayu Onsen is Japan’s coldest onsen town, with winter temperatures plunging as low as -30 degrees Celsius. Unique natural phenomena arise when temperatures reach -15 C, including diamond dust that becomes visible when steam freezes after swirling up from the onsen river; trees that become encrusted in ice; and otherworldly-looking frost flowers that glint off the frozen surface of Lake Kussharo, where whooper swans from Siberia winter each year.,“The power of nature here to inspire artists is extraordinary,” Imai explains. Despite the area’s natural beauty, however, he says that its art scene was nonexistent — until Kawayu Onsen’s first art gallery opened in 2011. He celebrated its opening by inviting several jazz musician friends from Tokyo to perform a live show inside his own ceramic kiln — “Japan’s very first ‘kiln live,’” he says proudly. The following year he organized On Art, a festival that fused onsen and art while raising funds to support the ongoing reconstruction of the Tohoku region following the previous year’s Great East Japan Earthquake.,
,
,Imai renamed his event the Teshikaga Extreme Cold Art Festival in 2013, when he began drawing crowds in the hundreds. In addition to a disaster relief concert and an outdoor museum called the Mashu Art Road, he rented out a hotel in the nearby town of Teshikaga for a seven-day, seven-room art event featuring seven artists from across Japan.,“While packing everything up afterward, I realized that what we really needed was a permanent space to create art,” Imai says. “Just then, I heard of an inn closing in Kawayu Onsen, so my company in Kyoto decided to buy it.”,Tapping into his extensive network of artists, Imai set about creating Art Inn, a space by and for artists that opened in 2018 as both a hotel and official festival venue. Although the event at first spanned anywhere from two to five weeks during the winter season, Imai adopted a fixed schedule in 2020, and now holds the festival every year from Feb. 2 through March 3.,“When we were first building the inn, the artistic perspective took absolute priority; a carpenter would have never built anything like this,” Imai says, grinning. Incorporating ideas from the stylish onsen , (traditional-style Japanese inns) he had stayed in while filming around Japan, Imai and his team of international artists fashioned guest rooms that integrated individual art installations into the interior design.,The inn also features several atmospheric pools for bathing in the local onsen waters, which Imai notes are perfect for healing and relaxation since they flow directly from the source of Mount Iou, a volcano located 2.5 kilometers away.,Artist Tsuneo Sekiguchi, who had built “rainbow huts” for the Setouchi Triennale and Echigo-Tsumari Art Field, also created a similar area for the first floor of the inn, using water and a sunlight-reflecting mirror to project a rainbow backdrop for a space of dancing and connection. He additionally incorporated ecologically friendly earthen plaster and jute coffee sacks into the walls, which he designed using a Michelangelo-style al fresco technique; and created another rainbow hut outdoors, along with a fire hut to host nightly bonfires and performances.,“Sekiguchi invited some artist friends from Taiwan, who then started inviting their own friends from other countries, too,” Imai says. “Just by word of mouth, more artists started coming to the festival each year, both from Japan and overseas. In this way, our network just kept growing.”,The inn is bordered by the Yuno River to the north, Kawayu Shrine to the south, and a nearly 5,000-square-meter red pine forest to the west that is home to a population of ezo deer. Imai describes the location as “a collaboration of art, onsen and severe cold … a place created by gods and artists.”,In the weeks leading up to the festival, artists arrive to prepare their works onsite, and are free to use the “, (snow forest) outdoor museum” as a giant canvas. They are also encouraged to use whatever natural materials they find on the grounds, and have access to an extensive collection of tools and machinery.,
,
,Naturally, the pandemic has impacted the festival, with the number of Japan-based artists decreasing due to virus-related concerns, and overseas artists unable to attend at all due to border restrictions. Still, the festival has persevered by instituting antivirus measures and limiting the number of attendees. For those unable to be there in person, Imai is also updating the event Facebook page with photos and videos featuring installations and performances.,This year’s edition of the festival, which is currently underway, features more than 40 works from both domestic and overseas artists. Pieces on display include Hiroshi Miyazaki’s “Celebration Forest,” which depicts the , forest spirits from indigenous Ainu legends, and Taiwanese artist Kuei-Chih Lee’s “Snow Words,” which represents an effort to transcend barriers by listening to the “voice” of falling snow. One of Imai’s own contributions is “Collection of Forest Power,” an installation crafted from wood and glass as a receptacle to hold the collective energy of the forest.,Repeat exhibitor Lua Rivera, a visual artist from Mexico, is quoted in the festival pamphlet as saying, “Staying at Art Inn has been a wonderful experience. … I dare say that there are very few places like this in the world.” One of her works, a simple and yet dramatically vibrant piece titled “Onibi,” features red ribbons suspended between trees above the snow. Describing it as “a textile kinetic installation that represents an interdimensional portal suspended in time and space,“ Rivera adds, “I experiment to know, and produce to survive. Art can erase the boundaries between disciplines, promoting a free interaction between them and allowing the exhibition to transcend the walls of the gallery.”,Another regular contributor is Jun Honma, a Tokyo native who deeply probes binaries such as history and memory; and presence and absence. He also explores the mutual interplay between nature and living beings.,“In this extreme, cold place, I want to create a landscape that evokes the overlapping of time events that are now invisible,” his description reads. “It is a landscape where the fragments of the people who have formed this place assimilate and disappear in the background. Falling snow will also make them invisible.”,The high acidity levels of the local onsen waters feature additionally in the art installations, as the sulfuric steam is capable of dissolving metals and concrete. Imai notes that while this causes problems for local innkeepers, it has also created its own genre of “corrosion art.” Tokyo-based artist Daigo Kobayashi’s “Sulphur Piano” highlights this phenomenon with an installation in which he wraps a piano in 400 sheets of pure silver foil, thereby revealing how colors shift from the volcanic steam.,Despite the continuing pandemic, Imai is confident that attendance will eventually return to pre-coronavirus levels that saw 1,500 visitors in 2019. Coincidentally, the official name of his combination inn-museum is the Art Inn Extreme Cold Art Contagion Machine. When asked about any COVID-19-related allusions this could conjure, Imai says cryptically that he simply “anticipated the virus in advance.”,“I deliberately chose the word ‘contagion’ because art represents a feeling or an energy that spreads from person to person,” he adds. “And I believe that only people who understand the deeper meaning of this sentiment will come to the festival.”,The Teshikaga Extreme Cold Art Festival runs through March 3 in Kawayu Onsen, Hokkaido.

			,Contributing Writer,During a recent interview via video chat at the Collect craft design fair at Somerset House in London, , flips his iPad camera toward several of his sculptural works — complex pieces of fine hawthorn twigs carefully tied together with minute knots of waxed linen twine to form delicate three-dimensional rings.,“It’s difficult to explain the medium and sculptural aspects of my work in still images,” he says, as he pans around the pieces and takes the camera in for a close-up. “I collect the materials myself from nature and because it’s so intricate, I had to use tweezers to tie the threads.”,
,Takadoi, represented by Jaggedart gallery in London, is one of around 20 Japanese artists who showcased their contemporary works at the annual Collect event, which this year features over 30 galleries. Officially called Collect: The Leading International Fair for Contemporary Craft and Design, and produced by the U.K. national charity Crafts Council, the event was held in-person from Feb. 25 to 27 and will continue virtually through March 6.,Though the event isn’t categorized by region, Collect market consultant Daniella Wells says that this year, the exhibition saw many East Asian artists represented in international group exhibits, as well as a focus on East Asian artists by various European galleries, including Micheko in Germany, ESH Gallery in Italy, and Maud and Mabel in the U.K.,
,
,“During the first few years of the fair, works from Japan were the most prevalent. In more recent years, we’ve seen a significant expansion through East Asia, particularly from South Korea,” Wells says. “However, Japanese works of art continue to be crucial. Artists from Japan typify the maker mentality with a dedication to skills, respect for materials and honoring techniques from the past with a contemporary voice.”,For Japanese artisans, Europe has become an attractive destination not only for further training, but also for innovation within the blurred margin between craft and art.,“The U.K. has an excellent reputation for higher education in craft. There are excellent routes to market here,” says Caroline Jackman, head of the Craft Business Skills team at the Crafts Council, mentioning courses, training and creative enterprise offers at universities and colleges in cities such as London, Farnham, Birmingham, Plymouth and Manchester.,“In addition to this, Crafts Council U.K. is one of the leading business incubators for contemporary craft, through programs such as Hothouse, where emerging makers are provided with the skills to enable their business to establish and thrive.”,Events like Collect, says Takadoi — a horticulturalist and Leeds Beckett University garden art and design graduate — also offer creators a platform to show unique pieces to a generally more receptive audience.,“Museum collections in Japan usually have specific categories, such as bamboo basketry, ceramics or painting,” he explains. “I do use some Japanese materials, like ,(paper thread), but I harvest most materials myself, and my techniques are also self-invented. It’s not considered a craft there. So, I have been extremely fortunate to benefit from two very different cultures. Having been brought up in Japan I have naturally absorbed the Japanese aesthetic. This will never leave me and will always influence everything I do. But exposure to a less disciplined way of doing things in the U.K. allows me to stretch the boundaries.”,
,
,, whose sculptures were part of Ruup & Form’s showcase at Collect, cites similar reasons for establishing herself in London. Her works — created in paper coated in , (fermented persimmon tannin lacquer), laser cut and manipulated into otherworldly organic forms — explore notions of sustainability and the potential of paper as a textile.,“I’ve been in the U.K. around 10 years, so maybe it’s different now, but I felt that in Japan, crafts had boundaries that couldn’t be overstepped, and that education focused foremost on honing technique,” says Maeda, who originally trained in traditional wood carving in Japan.,“When I came to the U.K. to study at the Chelsea College of Art and Design, however, the emphasis was on concept and research. I was given the freedom to explore, contextualize and embed creative approaches to sustainable design into my research and practices, as well as experiment with different materials and techniques.”,Increased concerns over sustainability worldwide, Maeda adds, may be contributing to a growing popularity of Japanese crafts and concepts in the U.K.,“I’ve met many people in London interested in Japanese crafts, especially mending and natural dyeing techniques, such as , (stitching), , (indigo dyeing) and , (ceramic repair). You can even easily find classes to learn these skills,” she says. “I think Japanese techniques and ideas are a perfect fit for helping create a more sustainable future society.”,Silversmith ,, represented at Collect by the Ruthin Craft Centre in Wales, was first drawn to Scotland by an artist-in-residence program at the Glasgow School of Art.,“I heard from silversmith Hiroshi Suzuki, who also established himself in the U.K., and whom I worked with in Japan, that there were more opportunities to become full-time artist silversmiths in the U.K.,” he says. “So after my residency, I applied for an exceptional talent visa and found work with Junko Mori, a Japanese metalwork artist in Wales, where I am now based.”,Using chasing and repousse to hammer-raise silver into unusual textures and sculptural patterns, Yamamoto has won silversmithing awards in the U.K., Holland and Germany for his vessels and artworks. The techniques, called “,” in Japan, he says, are similar to those used in the U.K., which has its own centuries-long history of metalworking. Like Maeda, he recalls craft education in Japan being technique-oriented, with concept and artistic expression only introduced later, but it was a lack of demand for silverware that was more restricting.,
,
,“I believe Japanese silversmiths are among the top in the world, and the training and apprenticeships contribute to that,” he says. “But silversmithing is a difficult market in Japan. I’m not sure why.”,Other Japanese works presented at Collect 2022 included bamboo, lacquer, ceramics and glass, all in contemporary forms and designs that push the boundaries of their crafts. Yet it’s the authenticity of background, however subtle, that Yamamoto says can work to the artisan’s advantage.,“For me, my uniqueness, my Japanese perspective, is an advantage in the U.K.,” he says. “My style of silver chasing involves patterns and, though I’m also inspired by William Morris and stained glass, my cultural education was in Japan, so I’m still influenced by kimono textile motifs, traditional Japanese artists like (18th-century painter) Ito Jakuchu and hanging scroll paintings.”,Likewise, Takadoi mentions provenance is of great interest to viewers of his work. “My story, my background, the unusual materials and how they are collected helps draw people in,” he says. Maeda notes that she has even been asked by visitors if she sold the kakishibu used for her pieces.,“There has been a dramatic growth in the number of people buying craft between 2006 and 2020. With 73% of the U.K. population buying craft in 2020, the sector has now entered the mainstream market,” Jackman says. “The total value of craft sales has increased from £883 million (¥136 billion) in 2006 to over £3 billion (¥462 billion) in 2019.”,Of that growth, sustainability, provenance, authenticity, artisanal works and the opportunity to support talent were important to purchasing decisions. Good news for craftspeople from anywhere in the world, and a sign that, if not in Japan, contemporary or experimental interpretations of traditional craft have a stable home in the U.K.,Collect: The Leading International Fair for Contemporary Craft and Design can be viewed online with an additional nine galleries through March 6 at ,.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 is one of the most significant events in Japanese history, yet the sleepy town in Gifu Prefecture where the battle took place is almost completely off the tourist trail for domestic and international sightseers. Guidebooks hardly mention it, with the surrounding areas often entirely overlooked.,“Even the Japanese think there’s nothing there, but that’s the point — most of Japan’s major battle sites have been built over or have roads running through them. Sekigahara has remained pretty much the same for 420 years,” says Chris Glenn, author of the new book, “The Battle of Sekigahara: The Greatest, Bloodiest, Most Decisive Samurai Battle Ever.”,

,That’s not to say the town is without infrastructure or attractions, just that it hasn’t been spoiled by rampant industrialization or the worst trappings of tourism.,“The whole area has been much better preserved,” adds Glenn, who also serves as Sekigahara’s tourism ambassador. “The (Gifu Sekigahara Battlefield Memorial Museum) has been rebuilt to make it bigger, with better maps and better signage in both Japanese and English.”,The battle was the culmination of the Sengoku (Warring States) Period (1482-1573) and ended more than 150 years of civil war. The site itself sits at the western edge of Gifu Prefecture, at a bottleneck between the mountains that separate eastern and western Japan. The eastern forces, led by Tokugawa Ieyasu, faced the western forces, a coalition of clans that had supported Toyotomi Hideyoshi and were led by Ishida Mitsunari. Ieyasu won, ushering in peace under the Tokugawa shogunate and a period of national isolation.,Glenn’s book, written in an engaging and easy-to-read style, sets the scene before walking the reader through a blow-by-blow account of the battle and discussing its aftermath. Many military histories get bogged down in details, losing the reader among tactical minutiae and technical specifications — but not this one. That’s in part because of Glenn’s talent for communicating, a skill that was honed over years working as a radio presenter for Nagoya-based music station Zip-FM, and through his various TV appearances on history programs and chat shows. His obvious love and enthusiasm for the subject at hand is also a major factor.,
,
,Speaking from his home via video chat, Glenn sits in a room flanked by nine full sets of samurai armour, weapons and other relics.,“When I was 16, I came to Japan as a Rotary exchange student and spent a year in Sapporo,” he recalls. “When I was living there, one of my teachers knew that I was interested in Japanese history, particularly the samurai, so he gave me a book about the life of (Japanese swordsman and philosopher) Miyamoto Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa. The book actually starts at the Battle of Sekigahara and, of course, that was just like a magical word to me.”,Traveling from Sapporo down to Gifu Prefecture on his own was out of the question for the teenage Glenn, however, and after a year in Japan he returned to his native Australia. But that initial spark could not be extinguished.,He returned to Japan in 1992, and moved to Nagoya in the following year to work for Zip-FM. His interest in all things samurai led to a chance encounter with an artisan who produced armour in the traditional manner.,“When he realized I was interested in samurai history and culture, he took me on as an apprentice,” he says. It was this craftsman who first took Glenn to Sekigahara, a trip that inspired him to learn more.,“My initial research involved going through Japanese books on the subject,” Glenn says. “I also talked with the staff and researchers at the original Sekigahara museum and went to public lectures. Then, I purchased a set of old diaries, accounts of the battle and a few maps and texts from the Edo Period (1603-1868). With the help of friends who read old Japanese, I went through these as well.”,After around 14 years of research, Glenn published his first book on the historic battle in 2014. It was titled, “The Battle of Sekigahara: The Greatest Battle in Samurai History,” and it led to his appointment as the tourism ambassador, which in turn led to him receiving greater access to valuable resources.,“(The ambassador position) led to an influx of translation work of various texts, books and information,” he says. “I also came into contact with other researchers who opened many more doors and avenues to information. I was able to see scrolls, maps, texts, old letters and so on that weren’t often displayed, if at all.”,It became clear that there were a number of preconceptions held by the wider public that were, in fact, untrue.,“There are popular stories told that, when you dig a little bit deeper, you find are probably not true,” he says. “Being able to do that was great, so with all this new information and a lot of new details, I decided to put out the second book.”,
,
,One of the most fascinating aspects of “The Battle of Sekigahara,” which is an updated version of his 2014 book, is his claim that had Ieyasu lost the battle, Japan could have been colonized by Western powers.,“Prior to Sekigahara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was slowly opening the country and a lot of the missionaries were coming into Japan,” Glenn explains. “Of course, they weren’t there just to preach, they were looking for trade, to take over the country and take its riches back to Europe. Spain had gone to the Americas and had taken over a lot of the countries there, and it was happening in the Philippines as well. When Japan realized that, they took a dim view.”,Due to their geographic locations, the western clans were often more used to outside contact and likely would have wanted to continue opening up the country to trade with foreign nations.,The incoming missionaries, however, were slowly undermining the central authority of Hideyoshi. “They were getting a lot of samurai into their religion, and it meant that Hideyoshi was losing his power over the samurai,” Glenn says. “If the foreigners could control the major daimyo, then they could control Japan like a puppet state.,“My belief is that because the Tokugawa were strong enough to actually shut the entire nation down for 260 years, it made Japan stronger. It stopped Japan from being overtaken in the way that countries like Vietnam and the Philippines had been, and had their culture and their way of life suppressed.” A Tokugawa loss “probably would have brought an end to the samurai period much earlier.”,Sekigahara, then, really is one of the most important moments in the development of Japan as a nation. Now, with Glenn’s new book, this fascinating story is being opened up to a new audience at home and abroad.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,“Monkey Man,” Takuji Ichikawa’s second release from Red Circle Minis, opens with a scene at once familiar and jarring as a new student at a Japanese high school witnesses an act of bullying.,It’s a surreal introduction to Ichikawa’s world: On page one, the 17-year-old narrator, Yuri, watches the would-be victim, Tengo, bolt out of the school gates, roll uninjured across the windshield of a passing car, and wave in apology as he escapes his tormentors.,
,
,Although Yuri’s new school seems like countless others, it is soon revealed that the society she lives in is plagued with destruction brought on by climate change and an illness dubbed the “misery virus,” with symptoms of “apathy, amnesia, cognitive impairment and severe depression.” There’s also a mysterious network of interconnected governments, corporations and organizations known as The Complex, which manipulates events and information. Ichikawa successfully crafts a world both relatable and fantastical, and the parallel problems of their world and ours lend an allegorical layer to the novella.,
,
,Although Ichikawa quickly (and at times clumsily) covers a lot of backstory, the action-packed book unfolds with a simplicity that more than makes up for its stumbles. While at school, Yuri discovers three beacons of hope and rebellion against the dark forces of society: a resistance group called Arlecchino; a trending video game called Babel; and, most significantly, a group of teens who have developed various special powers after experiencing an “awakening.” Surprised to realize these abilities have manifested in Tengo and others, Yuri admits she has healing capabilities of her own. The novella, however, never focuses on the supernatural powers of the youths, but rather on their compassion and realistic attitudes toward the struggles they face. The growing relationship between Yuri and Tengo thus becomes the focus of this thoughtful sci-fi parable.,“Monkey Man” can be read in one sitting, but the complications of Yuri’s world are fully realized within the short span of 92 pages. The connections and contrasts to our world are at turns bold and subtle. For example, Babel is an intriguing construct: a violent video game that rewards players for peaceful tactics and collaboration to resolve conflicts.,Ichikawa writes in the afterword that he considers “Monkey Man” a companion piece to “The Refugee’s Daughter,” the first novella he published with Red Circle Minis. Both stories deal with uncertain dystopian worlds where hope can only be found in the younger generation. Our current times, he writes, compelled him to explore “tales of the voiceless, the weak and the oppressed and those who have been distanced from public platforms by the power of dispute.”,Despite moments of unevenness in the novella, the world of “Monkey Man,” so near to our own, resonates and lingers.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

				,
			,Contributing writer,Landscape artist Marc Peter Keane’s most recent collection of essays, “Of Arcs and Circles,” pulses with wisdom. His meandering insights inspire frequent reading breaks for further contemplation, provoking an experience similar to walking around the “off-balance balance” designs of his Japanese gardens.,
,As a garden expert and writer who has lived in Kyoto for more than 20 years, Keane’s essays, like his design work, are deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics. His words loop easily from metaphysical questioning to practical observations, with clear nods to the winding structure of the Japanese , personal essay form. “Of Arcs and Circles,” however, is not strictly for Japanophiles.,
,Even when considering concepts such as , (imperfection) or emptiness, Keane’s essays are grounded in his own experiences. His observations stem from his young adulthood in the United States, his many years in Japan as a specialist in Japanese garden design, and his home in Ithaca, New York. This blend of places expands his ideas with a touch of relatability, even for readers unfamiliar with Japanese culture or the country.,
,
,Unlike many books detailing “the Japanese experience,” Keane seems unconcerned with passing on so-called Zen knowledge or delivering thinly-veiled cultural diatribes. Instead, he plays with style and language to render a personal experience, record a moment or divulge a thought for his readers to consider. His book is a written version of the Japanese proverb “,” (“one time, one meeting”), as each essay briefly welcomes us to the inner workings of his mind, a transient feeling of connection to be treasured and earmarked for future examination.,Throughout the book, Keane adroitly experiments with form. In the essay titled “Solace for the Tumbling Mind,” Keane observes his thought process as he walks through nature. He teeters between optimism and despair, noting that he is at first “buoyed by thoughts of a life based on trust and sanctity and abidance to natural rhythms,” but then his mind becomes “snagged on the crusted edges of wastefulness and callous indifference to the world that we also embody.” Avoiding any tidy conclusion, he leaves us with a symbol of humanity’s mark on the natural world, complicated and contradictory, as he describes approaching a polluted river. Although his initial intent is to clear the detritus, he discovers life among the litter — “a little fish lives in a spent can.” Keane is thus unable to disturb this fragile ecosystem created from our discarded trash.,Each essay is an unexpected foray into Keane’s fertile imagination. In “Dream Garden,” he crafts dreamscapes of an apocalyptic future to assert the importance of beauty to engender hope, and in “The Last God,” he questions humanity’s innate values, positing the idea that “mutations and accidental occurrences” quietly triumph over our gods of power and efficiency. “What does it say about our societies, which favor in so many ways those people who do everything correctly when in truth so many of our advancements have come from the accidental and the unintended?” he writes.,Keane provides no conclusions, but with each carefully crafted essay, he leaves his readers a little changed.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Yuko Tsushima was a prolific writer, known for her stories that center on women striving for survival and dignity outside the confines of patriarchal expectations.,Even after her passing in 2016, Tsushima’s literary legacy continues, with her novel “Woman Running in the Mountains” set to be republished in English by The New York Review of Books this month. The credit for Tsushima’s work appearing in English lies with translator Geraldine “Gerry” Harcourt, whose road to translating Tsushima’s early stories parallels the writer’s artistic conceits: a fiercely independent woman on the edges of society, determined to construct her own path.,
,
,Groundbreaking in content and style, Tsushima authored more than 35 novels, as well as numerous essays and short stories. However, without the dedication and loyalty of Harcourt, who forged a way alone in the tangle of international publishing to champion Tsushima’s work, novels such as “Woman Running in the Mountains” may have never been translated into English.,The translator came to Japan immediately after graduating from the University of Auckland in 1973, and at a time when non-Japanese residents were rare and openly regarded as outsiders, she worked as a commercial translator and freelancer to make ends meet as a single woman living on her own. Although literary translations were usually the province of university academics, Harcourt became deeply impressed with Tsushima — whose first novel, “Carnival,” was published in 1971 — and began translating her work on the side.,“It was the 1980s and no other translator was doing what she was doing, getting a Japanese woman author published in English without any university affiliation,” says Lucy North, a fellow translator and a close friend of Harcourt. “She was a total trailblazer. Self-funding all her literary translations, she went to book fairs by herself, relentlessly pitching Tsushima’s work until someone listened. … She was really tenacious, just fierce and devoted to getting Tsushima’s work to a wider audience.”,
,
,Tsushima’s 1978 novel “Child of Fortune” was published in English in 1986 by The Women’s Press, earning Harcourt the Wheatland Foundation’s translation prize in 1990. “Child of Fortune” was followed by English translations of a collection of short stories titled “The Shooting Gallery” in 1988, and “Woman Running in the Mountains” in 1991, as Tsushima gained acclaim within the English-language literary world.,In the 1990s, Harcourt branched out to translate other Japanese authors appearing on the scene, such as “Requiem” by Shizuko Go and “No One’s Perfect” by Hirotada Ototake, but she continued to translate Tsushima whenever possible. Although the tastes of readers had shifted to newer talent, Harcourt was determined to showcase Tsushima’s versatility, which became more apparent in the writer’s later works.,“She knew Tsushima was absolutely world-class, unignorable, posited by some in Japan as a serious Nobel Prize candidate,” North says. “And yet somehow the English-language publishers who had published her had either all narrowed their focus or closed down. Tastes and fashions in the English-speaking world also appeared to have changed by the 1990s, prioritizing ‘quirky’ works of surrealism, and there appeared to be no market for Tsushima.”,Even after Harcourt received a cancer diagnosis in the early 2000s, forcing her to take long breaks from literary translation as financial demands and health complications took over, she remained committed to translating Tsushima. She faced her illness the same way she approached translation, with a fierce determination to find the best way forward. “She chose the way she lived and chose the way she died. … Gerry had an exactness toward translation that she modeled in her approach to life. She was very demanding of herself to reach perfection,” says Yuko Matsuoka Harris, an interpreter, translator and close friend of Harcourt.,
,
,One of Tsushima’s novels, “Laughing Wolf,” was translated by Dennis Washburn and published in 2001, but little of Tsushima’s work materialized in English for the next 16 years. With Tsushima’s death in 2016, the pressure intensified for Harcourt, and when North heard that Penguin was “putting out feelers” for Japanese literature, she immediately passed on Harcourt’s contact. Penguin published Harcourt’s translation of “,” in 2017 to great acclaim, winning Harcourt the Lindsley and Masao Miyoshi Translation Prize awarded by the Keene Center. Her translation of “Of Dogs and Walls” followed in 2018.,Harcourt passed away in 2019, and The New York Review of Books’ edition of “Woman Running in the Mountains” is a welcome continuation of her efforts to keep Tsushima in the literary limelight. Like Tsushima’s novel, Harcourt’s life was tinged with hardship but illuminated by unwavering independence and indefatigable resilience. “The last two years of her life were happy and hopeful, despite her illness,” North says, “because she knew she was taking steps to relaunch Tsushima’s legacy.”,“Woman Running in the Mountains” opens with an unmarried woman in labor, struggling to make her way on foot to the maternity hospital an hour away. For the 21-year-old Takiko Odaka, the journey to the hospital shimmers with light and beauty despite her pain. In mesmerizing prose, Tsushima renders Takiko’s experiences both tender and fraught in her characteristic weave of interior musings and exterior observations. It’s the first step toward emotional growth, as the novel poignantly chronicles one year in Takiko’s life as a new mother.,Michael Bourdaghs, a professor specializing in modern Japanese literature at the University of Chicago, says now is the time to consider Tsushima’s stories again, particularly her later works, and continue down the path paved by Harcourt.,“Tsushima is an enormously important yet underrated writer,” Bourdaghs says. “The latter half of her career is even more fascinating — she developed a global awareness of literature, of Japan’s place in the world, of history, and really started experimenting with different ways of writing fiction.,“To Tsushima, literature meant indigenous stories, oral traditions, looking for global connections between them and tracing through moments of intersection. … There’s this whole other side of her work, just waiting to be discovered.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The course of true love never did run smooth, Shakespeare tells us, and the same can be said for “Vou: Visual Poetry Tokio 1958-1978,” a new book from Isobar Press. First conceived in the late 1990s by author and poetry editor Taylor Mignon, it has taken more than 20 years of twists and turns for the collection of Japanese visual poetry to come to fruition.,
,“I was co-editing (poetry magazine) Printed Matter from ’95,” Mignon says, “and one of the contributors was John Solt. He was translating contemporary poetry, more modernist works. In particular, he was submitting Katue Kitasono translations.”,
,Kitasono had been a pioneer of visual poetry in the prewar period, and later became the leader of the Vou (pronounced vow) Club, a group of artists who were at their peak in the 1960s and ’70s. “Simply put, visual poetry is a cross between art and poetry, a combination of image and letter, especially when the letter is being manipulated,” Mignon explains. The definitions are fluid, which is part of the joy of a collection that encompasses such a wide variety of work.,“It was so exciting to find another world of literature. I started looking into it and getting involved,” Mignon continues. “I saw Kazuko Shiraishi perform a lot — she was a Vou member — and I got to know Shohachiro Takahashi; I briefly met Toshihiko Shimizu; and I talked on the phone with Katsuhiko Okazaki, and then Shin Tanabe, who was one of the younger poets. So I was fortunate. I got to see the journals (published by the club) and started collecting them. We were in correspondence, exchanging letters, and I had the idea of this project. They said yes, let’s do this.”,
,
,Mignon began collaborating with Karl Young, a publisher at U.S.-based Light and Dust. “Karl had been my introduction to visual poetry back in 1992, through a series he published called ‘Word/Light Pescia,’ so he perfectly matched the project. I sent my whole collection of Vou journals out to him in the States.”,International communication back then wasn’t as instant as today, however, and the process of curating the visual poems slowed down. “We didn’t communicate well enough,” Mignon says of the delays. “It was hard because the artists (many of whom were born in the 1920s and ’30s) were dying. I felt awful, I felt so guilty that I couldn’t finish this project.”,Here, Mignon breaks off. “And then Karl died in 2017,” he says after a wave of emotion passes. With Young gone, and Mignon’s collection of journals effectively missing in the U.S., the project seemed doomed. However, not all hope was lost.,Through Kris Kondo, his cousin who was a poet and artist living in Japan, Young had made arrangements before his passing to return the archive to Mignon. “I got almost everything back,” Mignon says.,Determined to keep the project going, Mignon turned to another alumnus of Printed Matter, Paul Rossiter of Isobar Press. Without the original negatives, however, it was a challenge to reproduce the images. “We had to scan everything directly from the page,” Mignon says.,He pauses again, his emotions still strong. “This project absolutely wouldn’t have happened without Karl. He introduced me to visual poetry. It’s terrible to say that my co-editor’s death helped make the book happen but, in a way, it’s true,” he says, noting that the book, which at times seemed impossible to produce, is dedicated to the memory of Young. “It’s been a long process. In a way it’s a miracle this book even came out.”,
,
,While the moving backstory gives “Vou: Visual Poetry Tokio 1958-1978” a more personal touch than many poetry anthologies, the collection is far from an exercise in nostalgia. The artists highlighted in the book are of key importance to understanding 20th-century Japanese poetry.,The works of the Vou artists are perhaps not what many readers imagine when they think of Japanese poetry. One of the aims of this book, Mignon says, “is to make a difference in trying to open up Westerners’ minds to what they’re overlooking, what they’re missing out on.” This is in part thanks to the Beat Generation, a literary movement that emerged in the U.S. in the 1950s. Due to American Beat poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Philip Whalen, who spent time in Japan and produced work that was influenced by the country’s culture, Western perceptions of Japanese poetry “are more the reductionism of haiku,” Mignon says.,The Vou artists’ works are in some ways a reaction against the Western exotification of Japanese poetry and culture. Katsuhiko Okazaki, for example, “uses images of the female form but in a sense it’s a comment on the American Beats who tended to exoticize Asian women. Shinichi Sawada uses images of Western women to respond to the same thing,” Mignon says.,While the Beat poets were mostly men, the Vou Club was more gender-balanced. “Vou was open. There were many women contributors — they weren’t discriminated against and their work was welcome,” he says, adding that his book opens and closes with two female artists, Setsuko Tsuji and Fumiko Hibino. “Personally, I think Tsuji’s work is the best. Karl really loved Hibino’s work. So we sandwiched everything else between those two.”,Eric Selland’s excellent foreword puts the visual poetry movement into historical context, and Mignon’s introductory biographies for each of the nine artists help ground the reader, but it’s the work itself that matters. Each image is presented on a page by on its own with nothing but the title.,“I do offer some commentary,” Mignon says, “but I’m not trying to tell people how to interpret the works. I have my take and I chose the images, but I think that visual poetry is more intuitive and slightly antirational. There’s a freedom where you can come up with your own interpretations.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,It is perhaps unsurprising that a novel written by a Japanese author living in Germany, who regularly writes in both her native and adopted tongues, should focus so much on the nature of communication. The connection between language and identity is at the heart of “Scattered All Over the Earth,” a new novel by Yoko Tawada, translated from Japanese into English by Margaret Mitsutani.,
,The novel’s protagonist, Hiruko, is a climate refugee cast adrift in northern Europe after Japan has succumbed to an unspecified environmental disaster. The Japanese populace is scattered all over the Earth, and it has been a long time since Hiruko has spoken to anyone in her first language. She works as a storyteller for children in Denmark, translating folk tales and legends into Panska, a language of her own invention based on a blend of Scandinavian languages. Armed with Panska and her own positive, can-do attitude, she is able to converse with anyone she meets but still yearns to speak Japanese.,
,
,
,This desire sets her on a journey that is something of a “Canterbury Tales” for the 21st century. As Hiruko travels around Europe, she collects a band of lost souls, each with a story to tell. Each chapter is told by a different character, giving rise to an orchestra of voices intermingling, echoing, reinterpreting and retranslating one another. This is a thoroughly modern novel that reflects the seismic changes technology and globalization have wrought on humanity.,The voices are all those of young people, comfortable with the idea of having fluid identities and being rootless. Toward the end of the novel, the rag-tag group congregates in a closed restaurant, where their connections, fears and expectations are laid clear across a symbolic roundtable. There is no judgement or rejection; acceptance is the watchword of the group until one of their mothers arrives and begins forcing old-fashioned ideas on them. She categorizes them by race, gender and nationality — effectively excluding Akash, a transgender woman from India, because she doesn’t neatly fit into the rigid definitions the older generation clings to.,Although the novel has been described as dystopian, in actuality, it is supremely utopian. Tawada looks at contemporary identity politics as a revolution that can bring people together, a potential way out of the hideous mess we’ve made of the world.,
,
,The dystopia is the present day in which the reader lives, the one remembered by the characters in flashbacks, where people fear increasingly authoritarian governments and nations are paralyzed in the face of an impending climate crisis. Hamstrung by an inability to see beyond the weight of systems and institutions, the world’s inaction literally sinks Japan beneath the waves. The broken society, for Hiruko and her friends, is behind them. Now they are rebuilding a new, better future severed from the binaries, assumptions and demands of their parents’ generation.,Through Hiruko’s use of Panska, Tawada proposes that identities tied to nationalities, race and gender are holding us back as a species. It isn’t unusual for multilingual speakers to fashion a new personality to go with a new language — our very thought processes adjust to fit into the rhythms of an existing language and culture. For Hiruko, however, the process is reversed. She does not change who she is to adapt to a certain language. Rather, she creates a way of communication that is simple, open and friendly. The honesty of Panska arises from Hiruko’s nature, and because the invented language doesn’t stem from a national identity, it isn’t synonymous with a specific culture. It is, in Joycean terms, free from the nightmare of history.,Tawada’s real skill as a novelist is in making none of this didactic. Instead, she uses the polyphonic structure of the novel and the natural positivity of her characters to carry the argument, allowing the reader to lose themselves in the beautiful language, vivid descriptions of near-future Europe and the exciting thought experiments of a post-climate crisis renaissance.,This is not a novel for grumpy curmudgeons confused by pronouns or those who hark back to a “simpler” past; this is the first great utopian novel of the 21st century. Through Hiruko, Tawada encourages us to reject the exclusive, miserly conservative tendencies of the day and embrace the promise of a youthful revolution.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on Aug. 8, 1945. Within 24 hours, the Red Army was bulldozing its way into Manchuria, a vast region in China’s northeast that had been a Japanese colony since 1931. To Japanese authorities, the shock was vicious. By then, the Kwantung Army had been reduced to a shadow of its former self, its ranks depleted by repeated requests to send reinforcements to face the Americans in the Pacific. Resistance was shambolic and soon turned into a rout. A week later, Japan surrendered. The Second World War was finally over.,
,For countless Japanese soldiers and civilians still stuck in Manchuria, however, another nightmare was about to begin: On Aug. 23, Joseph Stalin ordered that half a million of those “physically fit to work in the conditions of the Far East and Siberia” be transported to the Soviet Union and deployed across 2,000-odd work camps. Most ended up in locations east of the Urals, but a few were sent as far away as the suburbs of Leningrad. Before long, they were put to work under brutal conditions, to rebuild Soviet infrastructure and industry. The majority — and the lucky ones — were repatriated before the end of the decade, but hundreds were compelled to stay until 1956. Tens of thousands never made it home, including the son of former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro.,
,Stalin’s motivations remain nebulous to this day. In “Eleven Winters of Discontent,” a thorough and well-researched academic study — and one of the handful on this topic in English — Sherzod Muminov identifies a number of possible explanations. One is economic: After years of conflict, Soviet infrastructure was in tatters and desperately short of labor. Japanese prisoners of war, the thinking went, could help rebuild the country. Another reason was diplomatic: By keeping a large number of hostages, Stalin hoped to gain leverage in future negotiations with the Japanese government and, perhaps more importantly, the United States, who now occupied Japan.,
,
,But there might have been another motive, this one far pettier, that tilted the scales: Stalin’s resentment at the decision of President Harry S. Truman to rebuff his request, presented on Aug. 17, that the USSR be allowed to occupy the northern half of Hokkaido. At Yalta, in February 1945, the Allies had agreed that the Soviet Union would recover the island of Sakhalin and occupy the Kuriles, but nothing had been said about Hokkaido. Muminov points out that only a day before Stalin’s unexpected demand, it was clear the Soviet regime had no intention to intern any Japanese on its turf. Was a rancorous Stalin trying to get even, annoyed by Truman’s flat — and, with hindsight, prescient — refusal? That is certainly possible, but a definitive answer will have to wait until Soviet archives are fully opened.,One thing is undisputed: the bleak conditions in Soviet camps. The first winter of 1945-46 was particularly harrowing. Soviet authorities had little time to prepare for the sudden inflow of hundreds of thousands of captives, most of whom showed up wearing summer clothes and with little else to prepare for the frigid temperatures of Siberia which, in January, often plummeted to -35 Celsius. Almost everywhere, accommodation was inadequate, food insufficient and heating nonexistent. Things improved somewhat over time, but remained spartan at best. Prisoners were always hungry.,Mental hardship was equally debilitating. Propaganda and political indoctrination formed an inescapable component of life in the camps. Soviet authorities tried to instill, “through persuasion, coercion and an array of incentives,” an awareness of the role the prisoners of war had played as international aggressors and thus a recognition of their responsibility to rebuild the USSR. Captives were forced to engage in mutual criticism and compelled to take part in sham trials of their peers. There was also a camp broadsheet, the aptly-titled Nihon Shimbun, which was mandatory reading.,
,
,These “factories of the soul,” as Muminov calls them, also had another purpose: To prepare the prisoners of war for their return to Japan where, it was hoped, they would be supportive of the nascent communist movement.,These efforts yielded mixed results. Defeat had bankrupted the ideology of the Japanese empire, and many internees were hungry for “alternative explanations of the new world order.” Starved for intellectual nourishment, some took to Marxism with gusto. A small number, perhaps a few hundred, even refused to be repatriated and decided to settle down in the USSR permanently. But the vast majority just wanted to go home and get on with their lives. They parroted Soviet propaganda when they had to, but promptly ditched all of it the moment they set foot on home soil.,Reintegration was the last challenge. Those who returned prior to 1949 experienced a relatively warm welcome. But the last to go back found a nation transformed, in the throes of the Cold War, concerned about a communist fifth column and suspicious of anyone with links to the Soviet Union.

			,Contributing writer,Every artist goes through some rough patches during their career, but Masato Hara has spent years in the wilderness. After racking up massive debts to produce his 2013 feature “I Wish You Were Here,” the Kyoto-based director lost his home in a fire in 2018, taking his entire archive of work with it.,That included the master tape for his landmark documentary, “The First Emperor” (1973), a hallucinogenic exploration of filmmaking and Japanese mythology that in its original version ran to about eight hours.,
,Hara, who was 68 at the time of the fire, suffered burns while trying to rescue a hard disk containing his latest work. Fortunately, the rest of his family escaped unscathed, and his wife, Maori, had the presence of mind to start filming on her iPhone.,Over the following days, she recorded the family’s experiences as they suddenly found themselves homeless. This intimate footage forms the basis of “Chronicle in the Ruins,” for which the couple share directing credits.,In the immediate aftermath of the fire, Maori and her children — a college-age son and much younger twin daughters — find temporary shelter at a local community center. They’re later joined by Masato, still wearing his hospital gown, his head swaddled with gauze and crowned with a baseball cap.,Despite the trying circumstances, they manage to contrive a sense of domesticity. Maori buys a rice cooker and keeps the kids distracted, while trying to figure out if they’d renewed their fire insurance coverage. Masato picks through the charred contents of a bag he salvaged from the wreckage, discovering that his , (personal seal) survived the blaze, as did his point card for electronics superstore Yodobashi Camera.,He’s also able to recover some burned canisters of film, including scraps of his 8 mm home movies, which intersperse the narrative. Extravagantly scarred and warped by the heat, they recall the celluloid mutilations of avant-garde filmmaker Peter Tscherkassky, except the figures they depict are younger versions of the people wrestling with adversity in the film’s present.,There’s no shortage of experimental movies that have used the physicality of celluloid to evoke memory and loss, but it’s especially poignant here. Like the water-damaged photos recovered after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan, the fragmentary footage both captures all that’s been lost, and embodies the trauma of the loss itself.,A different — and perhaps better — film might have placed these evocative remnants at the heart of the story. That the Haras choose to focus on their family instead shows that they have their priorities in the right place, but leaves their documentary caught in an awkward space between the transcendent and the mundane.,During its meandering final stretch, the film skips forward to 2021, and the family embarks on a summer vacation, with Super8 cameras in tow. It’s a gorgeous sequence, shown in split-screen format, and suggesting that no loss is ever final. Too bad that the film doesn’t finish there, but instead chooses to end with a montage of iPhone shots of Kyoto tourist spots, which look banal in comparison.,The theatrical release of “Chronicle in the Ruins” coincides with revival screenings of some of Masato Hara’s earlier work. New initiates should start there, though this post-disaster diary has its modest charms — and the couple’s twin daughters are a star act.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,While watching “Intimate Stranger,” Mayu Nakamura’s psychological thriller about a woman whose obsessive search for her missing son takes a strange and disturbing turn, it was hard not to think of “A Snake of June,” a 2002 erotic thriller by international cult director Shinya Tsukamoto.,One obvious reason: Asuka Kurosawa stars in both, though her troubled mother in “Intimate Stranger” seems to be worlds apart from her telephone counselor in “A Snake of June,” who is forced to live out the sexual fantasies of a stalker.,
,Despite the differences between these starring roles, and the two decades separating them, Kurosawa brings to both a presence that suggests depths of not only repressed desire but also darker emotional currents, especially in the new film. Finally, Nakamura’s muted color palette, which reinforces the film’s air of separation and alienation from the outside world, recalls the chilly, silvery black-and-whites that underlined the unsettling isolation of Tsukamoto’s protagonist.,Not that “Intimate Stranger” is any way a homage: Scripted by Nakamura, who has mainly made documentaries since her 2006 feature debut “The Summer of Stickleback,” the film focuses on a lonely middle-aged woman, giving her psychological complexity and an erotic inner life not bound by conventional social norms. The protagonist stands in contrast to the many Japanese films in which characters like her are reduced to sexless wives and moms.,The film begins with Megumi (Kurosawa) frantically searching online for any word of her teenage son, Shimpei (Yu Uemura), who has been missing for a year for unexplained reasons. Her offer of a reward draws a young drifter, Yuji (Fuju Kamio), who claims to be Shimpei’s acquaintance from an internet cafe. She gives him money and promises more if he can come up with additional information.,Not surprisingly, Yuji is a scammer working with gangsters, but instead of the easy mark she at first seems, Megumi is playing her own, hard-to-read game. Asking Yuji to tell her everything he knows and inviting him to stay in her apartment, she becomes not only his designated victim, but also his host, surrogate mother — and protector when detectives come calling.,But while she is away at her job in a store selling baby goods, he rifles through her drawers looking for valuables and finds a cache of baby booties. What is that about?,And why does she insist on shaving Yuji with a straight razor, sensually rubbing shaving foam on his face? Is she making a veiled attempt at seduction or lulling him before slicing his throat, having guessed his game?,The film is slow to reveal Megumi’s true intentions, and also slow to build tension. Instead, for much of its running time it plays like a character study of a woman who has been driven to desperation, despair and the edge of madness by the loss of her own baby, many years ago. But the climax delivers a reveal that may be well foreshadowed, but still shocks and chills.,More than a clever plot twist, however, Kurosawa’s layered (or rather veiled) performance as Megumi makes this deliberately paced film a riveting experience. Where, I wondered, has she been since her breakout long ago? Actually, working steadily in mostly supporting roles in TV dramas and the occasional film. But in “Intimate Stranger,” she comes triumphantly into her own, once again.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,As sure as spring follows winter, this time of year always seems to bring a fresh crop of romantic dramas to Japanese screens, each of them ripe with sentiment and practically choking on cherry blossoms. Later this month, viewers can sob themselves silly over Netflix’s “Love Like the Falling Petals,” but in the meantime there’s the tastefully lachrymose “The Last 10 Years.”,Michihito Fujii’s film is adapted from a novel by the late Ruka Kosaka, which drew on the author’s experiences of living with a terminal illness. It’s an odd choice for a director accustomed to more cerebral fare, and Fujii — reuniting with some of the production team from his earlier films , and , — sometimes seems to be working at cross-purposes with the material.,
,Nana Komatsu stars as Matsuri, a young woman with a rare lung disorder that has left her with only another decade of life. Rather than checking items off her bucket list, she takes a vow of romantic abstinence, only to have her resolve tested when she’s reunited with an old classmate, Kazuto (Kentaro Sakaguchi).,You know what to expect from a movie in which the opening shot features both cherry blossoms and a hospital bed. Yet the first hour is relatively low-key and full of relatable details, much of which Matsuri captures on a camcorder gifted by a fellow patient.,The school reunion party at which she and Kazuto reconnect is believably dowdy. When he finally confesses his feelings for her, Fujii lingers on each sensation: the sound of rain, the soap suds on their hands from washing dishes. It’s rather lovely, but things go downhill from there.,The movie is good at portraying the mundane reality of living with an incurable disease, with its medication regimes and grim markers of progressive decline.,There’s a similar inexorability in the way “The Last 10 Years” gradually succumbs to the mechanics of a big-budget tearjerker. The sophistication of the film’s visual aesthetic is undermined by a gushy soundtrack by rock band Radwimps, while the final act seems to consist of nothing but close-ups of people crying.,Komatsu does her best to provide an emotional core for a story that’s on constant fast-forward, but doesn’t hit the deep notes she reached in Edmund Yeo’s , a more resonant meditation on the fragility of life. Sakaguchi does well in the less showy part of Kazuto, visibly maturing as the story goes on, and the support cast — including Hana Kuroki and Yutaka Matsushige — are hard to fault.,The film’s compacted chronology and rueful tone put it in the company of recent romances such as Isao Yukisada’s , and Nobuhiro Doi’s , But it also bears a strong resemblance to Yukisada’s “Crying Out Love in the Center of the World” (2004), an overwrought weepy that did spectacular business at the Japanese box office.,Judging from the chorus of sniffles during the screening I attended, “The Last 10 Years” may pull off a similar feat, but there’s something a bit tawdry about the whole thing. As the music swells and the camera zooms in for another tear-streaked money shot, the film isn’t revealing anything profound. It just wants to make you bawl.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Pixar has a well-deserved reputation for dudes — movies focused on dudes (20 out of 24 feature films), movies directed by dudes (23 of 24), movies written by dudes (50 of 59 screenwriters). But the Disney-owned animation studio has been trying to evolve, largely because many of its own artists have demanded it.,“Get some ladies!” Domee Shi tells me in a recent interview. “Draw from different creative wells!”,
,Shi, who likens herself to a cat oscillating between “lazy and grrr,” arrived at Pixar as a storyboarding intern in 2011, when she was 22. She stayed on as a staff artist, contributing to films like “Inside Out” and “Incredibles 2.” In 2018, she became the first woman to direct a Pixar short. That eight-minute movie, “Bao,” about a dumpling that comes to life, giving an aging Chinese woman relief from empty nest syndrome, won Shi an Oscar — and put her on course to break an even bigger glass ceiling at Pixar.,The studio’s 25th feature, “Turning Red,” will arrive on Disney+ on March 11. Shi directed it, the first woman in the studio’s 36-year history with that solo distinction. (Brenda Chapman was hired to direct “Brave” [2012], about a defiant princess in ancient Scotland, and retains a credit. But she was fired during production for “creative differences” and was replaced by a dude.),Moreover, “Turning Red” tells an unabashedly female story — so much so that it reads as a corrective to the Woody-Buzz-Flik-Sully-Mike-Mater-Lightning-Luca bromances in which Pixar has specialized.,Shi’s film is about a Chinese Canadian teenager, Meilin Lee, who finds herself engulfed by the onset of puberty: horniness, whipsawing emotions, her period. When she feels overwhelmed, she “poofs” into a giant red panda. Shi says her screenplay, written with Julia Cho, was influenced by pop culture totems like “Teen Wolf” and “Lizzie McGuire.” Perhaps also toss in the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from “Ghostbusters,” the comedic group of older women from “Crazy Rich Asians” and Judy Blume’s seminal “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.”,“Did the red peony bloom?” Meilin’s mother, Ming, asks early in the film. Mei, who has locked herself in the bathroom, having “panda-ed” for the first time, can only stammer in response. She’s too busy having a meltdown over a sudden outcropping of fur.,“I wanted Mei to go through a magical puberty transformation, and I couldn’t get the image of a red panda out of my head because it’s so cute and funny, especially if you blow it up to, like, 8 feet tall,” Shi says. “There’s something about the color, too. Red represents your period. It represents being angry, being embarrassed or being very lustful for someone.”,Mei, voiced by newcomer Rosalie Chiang, has boys on the brain, as do her three best friends. Their obsession with a boy band results in a panda-on-panda showdown that is part superhero film climax and part sumo wrestling match. (Shi has referred to the vibe as “Asian tween fever dream.”) Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas, wrote songs for the film.,“We are walking into that concert girls,” one of Mei’s nerdy friends says, “and walking out women.”,Even in 2022, this is groundbreaking stuff for a major animated movie, especially one from The Walt Disney Co. “It’s a side of teen girls that you never get to see,” Shi says. “We are just as awkward and sweaty and lusty and excited as any boy.”,
,
,About a decade ago, Disney and Pixar started to routinely showcase different cultures, races and ethnicities. The success of “Big Hero 6” (2014) and “Moana” (2016) led to diverse films like “Coco,” “Raya and the Last Dragon,” “Soul” and “Encanto.” Some of those same movies continued to break down gender stereotypes by depicting bold, brainy women who didn’t need a man’s love to make them whole. (Credit to “Brave” for fostering that change.) Pixar also began to embrace progressive storytelling in its short films, most prominently with “Out,” about a man who decides to stop hiding that he is gay.,But adolescent sexuality and the biological changes that come with it have remained a third rail. Some slight innuendo? Maybe. Anything more might spook conservative parents and threaten Disney’s family friendly brand.,“How do I sneak this through?” Shi recalls thinking before one pitch meeting with senior Walt Disney Studios executives. “How do I sell this and get old white men who’ve never experienced this before excited about this and wanting to, like, see more of it?”,Disney, which, like other Hollywood studios, had been espousing female empowerment in response to the #MeToo revolution, put its money where its mouth was: In spring 2018, the company gave Shi a budget of roughly $175 million to tell her story, along with the backing of its merchandising and marketing divisions.,“I felt like they were always in my corner, even if they sometimes were, like, whaaat?” Shi says.,At the time, Pixar was in turmoil. John Lasseter, the studio’s chief creative officer, had been placed on leave following complaints about inappropriate workplace behavior. Others blasted Pixar for sidelining women and people of color. Lasseter apologized for “missteps” and resigned in June 2018.,Pixar filmmaker Pete Docter (“Up,” “Inside Out”) was handed the studio’s creative reins, which was fortuitous for Shi, since Docter had helped shape her unconventional “Bao.”,The short has an offbeat ending that is meant to symbolize the all-consuming love of a parent: The older woman abruptly eats the dumpling, little legs and all. It was the ending that Shi wanted all along, but she had chickened out when first pitching the story to her bosses. “I worried that eating the dumpling was too dark and weird and confusing and totally not something Pixar would go for,” she says. So she pitched a safer option.,“Pete was in that pitch meeting,” Shi recalls, “and he stood up and said, ‘Wait, no, that is not the version you told me about a couple weeks ago.’ He turned to the group and said, ‘Her original ending was really cool and weird and shocking.’”,Shi was allowed to repitch, this time with her idea intact. “I think because of that experience it gave me the confidence to not be afraid to try bold, weird and shocking things in the stories I want to tell — to not censor myself,” she says. (“Domee knows that surprise is something we all crave in stories,” Docter says in an email. “We don’t want to be able to predict where things are going. And with Domee, I find that is often the case — both in her work, and as a person!”),“Bao” won the 2019 Oscar for best animated short. In her acceptance speech, Shi implored “all the nerdy girls out there who hide behind their sketchbooks” to tell their stories. “You’re going to freak people out,” she said, “but you’ll probably connect with them, too.”,“Turning Red” has already stirred both reactions. On Twitter, people have been celebrating Mei’s story as long overdue. “Finally, my anxious Asian girl representation,” one user wrote. The Pixar film has also sparked a wider conversation about how periods are portrayed by Hollywood in general. (Usually with a fair amount of shame and disgust.),But there has also been blowback, with a mostly male contingent of animation fans attacking the film for its anime-inspired character design; many of those comments have a misogynistic undertone. “You just don’t like the fact that teen girls are getting something that’s catered to THEM,” one person clapped back.,Disney’s decision to largely bypass theaters in favor of Disney+ has also created a swirl of tension. Shi’s film will be offered for free to Disney+ subscribers, leading some fans to conclude that Disney does not believe that “Turning Red” merits a theatrical release. (“Luca” and “Soul,” both from Pixar, got the same treatment.) Disney cited the lingering coronavirus threat as the reason for its decision.,“It was obviously made for theaters,” Shi says. “At the same time, all of my favorite movies when I was growing up were ones I watched on VHS. I’d rewind my favorite parts and watch those again and again.”,Shi was an only child. Her parents immigrated to Toronto from China when she was a toddler. Her father, an art teacher, helped instill a love for animation; she was vice president of her high school anime club. Her mother kept the home. Around age 13, Shi and her mother started to lock horns. “I was slowly going into this Western culture world, and that was very different from her,” Shi says, “and I could feel that rift happening, but not wanting it to happen, but, at the same time, I did want it to happen.”,That push-pull lies at the heart of “Turning Red.” The movie is about puberty, but it’s also about what girls inherit from their mothers. Ming wants to pass complete emotional control on to her daughter, notes Lindsey Collins, who produced the film. But Mei has to decide whether to disobey her mother and let her “inner beast” be seen.,“Girls and women are always judged for not controlling their emotions — ugh, she’s so emotional,” Collins says. “I love that we have a main character who is learning over time that she doesn’t have to push emotions away or get rid of them to be considered a good girl or a good woman. The movie is ultimately about being able to own your emotions. Own ’em!”,Shi’s relationship with her father is not reflected in “Turning Red,” but Shi says he was the one who kept pushing her to pursue a career at Pixar, even after the studio initially rejected her application, when she was a junior at Sheridan College in suburban Toronto. “No pain, no gain” was his mantra.,But breaking into the animation industry boys’ club was daunting. “It felt like you had to know a guy who knew a guy,” Shi says. “It can still feel like that, but less so, I hope.”,“Turning Red” drives home that message. Mei’s family operates a temple. It was built to “honor our ancestors,” Ming explains while giving a tour.,Mei pointedly interjects.,“And not just the dudes, either,” she says.,

			,Contributing writer,Following her international breakthrough in 2017 with “,,” Akiko Ohku became known for quirky comedies about a single woman’s search for love. And she had a populist touch: “Tremble All You Want,” which starred Mayu Matsuoka as a nerdy office worker obsessed with her junior high school crush, and the 2020 rom-com “,,” which features Rena Nonen (better known as Non) as an office clerk who gets romantic advice from a voice in her head, both won audience awards at the Tokyo International Film Festival.,Ohku’s new film, the perky nuptial disaster comedy “Wedding High” — scripted by comic Hidetomo Masuno, aka Bakarhythm — represents a change in direction if not her aim to entertain: Unlike the above-mentioned films, it is an ensemble piece, with the ostensible star, TV drama veteran Ryoko Shinohara, not taking center stage until nearly 40 minutes in.,
,Shinohara plays Maho Nakagoshi, a spark plug of a wedding planner who loves her job. Both she and her staff are dedicated to giving newlyweds the ideal wedding, even when their clients are driving them nuts with impossible demands. In this respect, “Wedding High” resembles the many Japanese movies in which a team unites to earnestly overcome obstacles, while delivering a collective shoutout to the organization men (and women) in the audience.,The film differs in being light on its feet and even laugh-out-loud funny, though to understand the gags it helps to have experienced (or suffered through) a typical Japanese wedding reception, which has elements from both the West (cutting the cake) and Japan (the couple’s bosses each giving speeches).,This story, however, begins with the central pair, Haruka Nitta (Nagisa Sekimizu) and Akihito Ishikawa (Tomoya Nakamura), planning their big event. The myriad decisions to be made excite Haruka, but bore Akihito, though he wisely never shows it. We also get a quick glance at their respective pasts, including Haruka’s long-time relationship with a former college classmate, Yuya (Takanori Iwata), which ended abruptly.,In the fraught process of deciding who to invite, Yuya is excluded, as might be expected. When he hears about the wedding, he decides to crash it, with the assistance of two happy-go-lucky buddies.,Finally, the reception gets underway, but the lengthy albeit hilarious (to the guests) speeches by the couple’s respective bosses result in the program running an hour behind schedule. How can Maho and her colleagues miraculously make up the lost time?,Their solutions have a crazed brilliance born of desperation, and are staged with brio and wit, although the slapstick comedy of Yuya’s encounter with a wedding gift thief uses gross-out humor for its payoff laughs. Having seen my share of Japanese TV variety shows, where said humor abounds, I was more inclined to groan.,Even so, with Shinohara’s relatably frazzled performance as Maho serving as ballast, the film stays firmly grounded in the real-world agonies and ecstasies of Japanese-style weddings. In fact, it is instructive viewing for both aspiring wedding planners and future wedding participants.,Lesson one: When your intended asks for your opinion on anything wedding related, “I’ll leave it up to you” is the wrong answer. And ex-lovers had better drop any fantasies of changing the bride or groom’s mind at the altar. “The Graduate,” which “Wedding High” references but does not imitate, was only a movie.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Tokyo is a city of residues and echoes. There are still visible traces of the capital’s past, but much of its history exists more in the popular imagination.,Place names are embedded with allusions to buildings and geographical features that have long since vanished. Commemorative plaques inform passersby of sights they can no longer see — lost to fires, earthquakes, wartime bombing and the city’s endless cycle of construction.,
,In Senji Kuroi’s short story, “Tamaran Hill,” a middle-aged man becomes fixated on a curiously named slope near his home, in the suburbs of western Tokyo. “Tamaran” can be written with kanji, but when rendered in hiragana script, it’s also a common expression used to describe something unbearable.,What’s in a name? The protagonist’s attempts to find out take him from reference books to the lyrics of a song by rock band RC Succession. One explanation holds that the moniker was bequeathed by a defeated samurai, trudging up the hill as he fled the scene of a battle; another says it was coined by students from the local university, back in the days when the roads were still unpaved and they had to squelch through mud on their way to lectures.,This inquisitive tale is given a meta twist in director Tadasuke Kotani’s screen adaptation, which started life as a class project at Tokyo’s Musashino University (where the film’s producer, Shinobu Tsuchiya, teaches literature). The movie wears its intellectual credentials proudly — complete with silky monochrome visuals — but is too playful and heartfelt to be accused of pretentiousness.,Its star, Hinako Watanabe, was a student at the university at the time of filming, though she’s joined by indie-cinema stalwarts Makiko Watanabe (no relation) and Kanji Furutachi. She plays a stone-faced college student, also called Hinako, who discovers Kuroi’s story while reading up about her hometown, and gradually slips into the narrative herself.,Much of the first half hour is spent just watching her read, as Kuroi’s text is brought to life with voiceovers, re-enactments and close-ups of a handwritten manuscript being revised in real time. It’s somewhere between a documentary and a radio play, but after Hinako has a chance encounter with the author (asking him, delightfully, if he’s a figment of her imagination), the film enters a more dreamlike state, which is heightened by the use of evocative animated sequences.,As our studious heroine delves into — and sometimes finds herself immersed in — the stories of Tamaran Hill, they evoke memories of her late mother, who died when she was young. What started as an intellectual inquiry takes on a more personal tone, though when the film’s focus shifts to Hinako’s real-world problems, including her strained relationship with her father (Furutachi), it becomes slightly less alluring.,The later scenes, in which she reconnects with a long-lost relative and finds some emotional closure, have a stiff formalism that doesn’t quite work. But taken as a whole, “Tamaran Hill” is as quietly absorbing as curling up with a good book. It doesn’t just capture the pleasure of reading, but the ways in which words can illuminate the world around us.,In Kuroi’s story, the protagonist worries that knowing too much could rob life of its sense of mystery. Yet by learning more about her hometown, Hinako ends up finding herself.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,On its very last night, the nightclub ageHa threw a party for the ages.,Thousands of revelers attended the “The Grand Final” event on Jan. 30 at the Studio Coast live music venue in the Shin-Kiba area of east Tokyo. The atmosphere was electric as house music thumped from the speakers and local favorite DJ Emma played for more than nine hours. Everyone in attendance received vials of sand and water from the pool area to take home as mementos. After the party, ageHa and Studio Coast closed for good.,
,From its opening in 2002, ageHa served as the largest nightclub in Tokyo for two decades, attracting both up-and-comers as well as big-name international acts. In August, it was announced that the landowners decided not to renew the contract with Studio Coast’s parent company, Mother Entertainment Inc., and in the following months, events and concerts held there took on a bittersweet tone, with the final slate of offerings in January providing a celebratory send-off to the space.,“The closing of ageHa is a very big deal, not only in Tokyo but also in the Japanese dance scene,” says Yoji Biomehanika, a world-renowned trance DJ who has been a fixture at ageHa since 2003. “It feels like the end of an era, because ageHa was definitely the temple of Japanese club culture.”,“I was impressed by the huge cylindrical woofers in the middle of the dance floor,” Biomehanika continues, recounting his first visit to ageHa, about six months after the venue opened. “It looked as if a baumkuchen-shaped UFO had landed there.” The spacious venue — both as Studio Coast and ageHa — was known for hosting some of the biggest non-Japanese artists as they toured the country, often supported by local talent.,“I already knew about ageHa when I was a teenager because some of my favorite DJs, like Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren, Tiesto and Derrick May played there,” says Seimei Kawai, co-founder of electronic label Trekkie Trax. (Kawai played ageHa’s penultimate party, as did Biomehanika). Throughout his teens, Kawai dreamed of hitting ageHa’s dance floor and listening to live music. “I collected ageHa’s event flyers, you could find them at record stores in Shibuya, and I put them on the wall of my room. They’re still at my parent’s house.”,AgeHa is where Kawai had one of his first club experiences, which helped inspire him to become an artist and start a label. He says the sheer size of the venue — with a 2,000-plus capacity — made it unique to the city. “It was like a magnet between the international and local club scene,” he says, adding that it gave artists in Trekkie Trax the chance to meet and play with foreign DJs.,“For locals, we could see what was happening overseas, what styles were popular abroad. (At ageHa) we could experience it live, rather than just through the internet,” Kawai says, adding that with the venue now closed, the only place non-Japanese acts can play will be at festivals like Ultra Japan or EDC Japan (both of which might not happen again for some time, given current pandemic-related border restrictions).,While the space is best known for attracting major talent and boasting an over-the-top party atmosphere — they once held an “EDM Train” event — it also offered a space for a diverse set of local sounds and performers to grow, including LGBTQ+ events such as the long-running Shangri-La night. Its size and popularity made it more accessible than some of the grittier spots around Tokyo, too, which allowed it to act as a bridge between mainstream and underground cultures.,“I think club culture is an exciting sort of chaos of music, art, fashion and other creative delights. There was always that kind of chaos at ageHa,” Biomehanika says. “It was a rare example of a facility that large, being able to try something creative like that.”,
,The closure of Studio Coast and ageHa comes amid a tumultuous period for Tokyo’s live music community. The COVID-19 pandemic has struck a devastating financial blow to many venues, and has resulted in several smaller ones shuttering permanently. Of those that are left, many have had to take unusual steps to survive, such as launching crowdfunding campaigns. Entering the third year of the pandemic — and in the middle of a quasi-state of emergency — the situation remains precarious, with murmurs among industry insiders suggesting that another summer of canceled concerts could force even more venues to call it quits.,
,
,Studio Coast’s fate isn’t totally at the mercy of the pandemic, however. Land redevelopment was another factor that pushed it to close, as was the case with Zepp Tokyo in Odaiba — another major live music venue — which closed up shop at the start of the year ahead of a massive area renewal set to be completed in 2025.,So what will happen to Tokyo’s club community? It’ll get smaller, at least in terms of overall size per venue, for starters. One example of what might come is Asagaya Drift, which sits close to Asagaya Station on the Chuo Line in the western part of the city. The compact music space opened in the fall and features an automotive theme that manager Kaita Tsuchiya says was inspired by the “Fast & Furious” film franchise. A visit to the bar during its opening weekend last October saw all of its charm on display. Revelers danced in front of YouTube videos projected onto the wall, while others lined up to try their luck on a slot machine to win a free drink. Meanwhile, DJs played music on a deck tricked out with a Ford Mustang bonnet mounted on the front.,“I like to think that Drift is the only place in Tokyo where DJs can feel like they are gracefully driving a car while in the booth,” Tsuchiya says.,Plans for the spot went into motion in the spring of 2021. Tsuchiya was managing an even smaller music bar in the nearby neighborhood of Koenji, the 20-person-capacity Yakusyu. Attendance proved better than he expected, so Tsuchiya began searching for a bigger space for a new venture, coming across property in Asagaya that was cheaper due to the pandemic.,“Nakano and Suginami wards have a local culture where bands and live houses are strong,” Tsuchiya says. “I wanted to create a DJ bar where all kinds of genres could be featured, and provide the sort of fun, familiar and local experience you can’t get in Shibuya, Shinjuku, Roppongi or other parts of Tokyo.”,Those areas Tsuchiya mentioned, however, are also seeing smaller-size venues pop up. Kawai points to Space Tokyo in Shinjuku, which opened at the end of 2020, as another example of a homely club venue. Even in the glitzier world of Roppongi, new clubs such as R3 Club Lounge — which aims to attract international acts, potentially filling the void ageHa leaves behind — feature small spaces, and put just as much emphasis on VIP experience and pool tables as live music.,“I don’t think it’s possible to have big spaces like ageHa anymore, given the circumstances. I think in the next few years smaller venues will become the norm,” Tsuchiya says. Kawai agrees, saying that everything in the city already feels like it’s shrinking in terms of size.,
,Prior to the pandemic, Japan’s club scene had taken a hit due to a so-called anti-dancing crackdown that primarily hit smaller spaces that couldn’t afford proper permits and accreditation. When COVID-19 forced a halt to concerts and DJ events, larger venues were affected. Tsuchiya believes that, when left with no other option than to stay home, more and more people picked up DJing as a hobby. As a result, there is now more of a demand to return to those smaller spaces where these burgeoning selectors can perform and perhaps improve.,A fragmented network of smaller clubs isn’t anything new to Tokyo either, which has long been known for a similar, rock-oriented live house culture. That system has its own problems, but would allow for a wider range of music and creativity to develop. Club enthusiasts will just have to search them out in the capital’s nooks and crannies.,As for the people involved with ageHa, the temple may be closed but their faith isn’t lost. Biomehanika says they will continue to organize shows and events in some capacity.,“The people behind it said, ‘We create parties because we believe that what we create will make the world a better place,’” he says. “I think that idea filled the hearts of the purists who gathered at ageHa, and that will be its greatest legacy.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,J-pop artist Ado’s career up to this point has been a Rorschach test for whoever has heard her.,Following her broadside against polite Japanese society with “,” and its , last year, you could see her either as a particularly acidic voice representing a new generation of youth, or as a threat to children’s ears thanks to the (gasp!) rude hook of the song (t​​he word, “,,” translates as “shut up” in English). She’s a fresh force in domestic music … or a potential blip bound to be remembered for ,.,
,The 19-year-old’s debut album, “Kyogen,” finds her rejecting any single label in favor of a more intricate approach. Ado still shreds her throat and gnashes her teeth at the modern world, but she’s also exploring love, loneliness and, in the biggest twist of all, optimism. The music mutates just as much, with Ado singing over guitar chugs, horn blasts and string swells. Not everything suits her, but the full-length underlines her confidence in giving it all a go and helping add new shades to contemporary pop music in Japan.,Ado’s voice stands out as her biggest strength. “Usseewa” introduced her husky tone and ability to rip into a near-shout, balancing an “I’m over it” attitude with actual anger. Across her debut, she shows further versatility, both in how she raises her register for dramatic effect (“Lucky Brute”) or keeps it low-key until injecting a burst of energy (“Motherland”).,Her voice is the most consistent element of “Kyogen,” as musically Ado’s debut explores a wide range of sounds. Arguably the biggest triumph of the album is how it truly mainstreams the sonic palette of the Japanese Vocaloid community, a scene built around singing-synthesizer technology. Artists such as Kenshi Yonezu and Yoasobi started out the same way before becoming J-pop heavyweights, but Ado drags the world she emerged from with her as she heads into the spotlight. Nearly every song features songwriting and production from a prominent Vocaloid producer (Giga, Mafumafu, syudou and Kujira, among others), their own flair and intricacies left intact.,“Kyogen” is at its best when Ado and the producers around her embrace digital chaos. The album opens with a one-two punch of “Readymade” and “Odo,” which mix EDM flourishes with pop swagger and TikTok-ready sonic textures. Later, electronic touches to the guitar-based “Kokoro to Iu na no Fukakai” add welcome tension. The detours are more mixed. Ado sounds at home over the uneasy shuffle of “Hanabi,” but when she tackles more straightforward rock (the surprisingly upbeat “Freedom”) or balladry (“Aitakute”), she loses her edge, turning into a kid trying to step into adult shoes.,Even these mismatched moments, though, add to an album about an artist coming into her own. Ado’s debut reveals depth to her artistry: She’s not just the angry “Usseewa” singer but a creator exploring the many moods of youth in modern day Japan, using a digital-native musical backdrop that has proven to be the most influential in the country today. “Kyogen’’ is Ado’s first step into the spotlight, revealing her creative ambitions and her adolescent confidence underlining them.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Leading up to Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime show, much ado was made over the fact that this would be the first year that hip-hop occupied the center of the concert. It was marketing copy that overlooked the glaring lateness of the achievement — that rap was finally getting the spotlight in perhaps the 20-somethingth year of hip-hop occupying the center of American pop music. Does progress this delayed still count as a breakthrough?,After several years of grappling with an assortment of racial controversies, the NFL likely wanted credit for showcasing Black music — especially hip-hop, the lingua franca of American pop culture — this prominently. What would some of rap music’s generational superstars — Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar — titans with little fear for their reputations, do with this most visible of platforms?,
,The stories told on the SoFi Stadium field Sunday night were multilayered, a dynamic performance sprawling atop a moat of potential political land mines. In the main, there was exuberant entertainment, a medley of hits so central to American pop that it practically warded off dissent.,Dr. Dre opened up the performance behind a mock mixing board, a nod to the root of his celebrity: the ability to mastermind sound. For the next 12 minutes, vivid and thumping hits followed, including “The Next Episode,” a wiry collaboration between Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, wearing a blue bandanna-themed sweatsuit; “California Love” (mercifully, delivered without a hologram of Tupac Shakur, as some had rumored); Eminem’s stadium-shaking “Lose Yourself”; Lamar’s pugnacious and proud “Alright”; and a pair of songs from Mary J. Blige, the lone singer on the bill.,50 Cent, hanging upside down from the ceiling of the set, was an unannounced guest, performing his breakout hit “In Da Club,” one of Dr. Dre’s seminal productions. (This was almost certainly the most bleeped halftime show ever.),The performances were almost uniformly excellent. Lamar was stunning — ecstatically liquid in flow, moving his body with jagged vigor. Snoop Dogg was confident beyond measure, a veteran of high-pressure comfort. Eminem, insular as ever, still emanated robust tension. Blige was commanding, helping to bring the middle segment of the show into slow focus with a joyous “Family Affair” and “No More Drama,” rich with purple pain. And Dr. Dre beamed throughout, a maestro surveying the spoils of the decades he spent re-orchestrating the shape and texture of pop.,
,
,But the true battles of this halftime show were between enthusiasm and cynicism, censorship and protest, the amplification of Black performers on this stage and the stifling of Black voices in various stages of protest against the NFL. Just a couple of weeks ago, the NFL was sued by former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores, who said he had faced discriminatory hiring practices.,This halftime show, which scanned as an oasis of racial comity if not quite progressivism, was the third orchestrated as part of a partnership between the NFL and Jay-Z’s entertainment and sports company, Roc Nation, that was struck in the wake of the kneeling protests spawned by Colin Kaepernick in 2016.,“It’s crazy that it took all of this time for us to be recognized,” Dr. Dre said at the game’s official news conference last week, underscoring that the NFL essentially chose to wait until hip-hop had become oldies music — apart from Lamar, every artist onstage Sunday had their commercial and creative peak more than a decade ago — in order to grant it full rein on its biggest stage.,The NFL is notoriously protective of its territory, and mishaps at the halftime show — Janet Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction, M.I.A.’s middle finger — have tended to cause outsized public brouhahas. Halftime may well be one of the last stages in this country where hip-hop still feels like outsider music, amplifying the sense that the interests of the league and of the performers might not have been fully aligned.,This year’s event also took place in South Los Angeles, just 20 minutes west of Compton, where Dr. Dre was a founder of N.W.A, one of the most important hip-hop groups of all time, godfathers of gangster rap and agit-pop legends. Compton was embedded into the stage setup: the buildings included signs for its various landmarks, including Tam’s Burgers, Dale’s Donuts, and the nightclub Eve After Dark, where Dr. Dre used to perform with his first group, World Class Wreckin’ Cru. The dances, from Crip-walking to krumping, were Los Angeles specific. Three vintage Chevrolet Impalas served as visual nods to lowrider culture. Lamar performed his segment atop a massive aerial photograph of the city.,
,
,Each of those nods felt salient and potent, a way to make this impossibly global event feel deeply local. But it wasn’t clear if the renegade political spirit that was a hip-hop hallmark when Dr. Dre was still a member of N.W.A would also make an appearance during the show.,A few hours before the game began, Puck News reported that Eminem, the show’s lone white performer, had proposed taking a knee during the set, and was denied by the NFL. It had the feel of a pre-manufactured controversy, the sort of leak engineered simply to be refuted.,And so there was Eminem, rapping “Opportunity comes once in a lifetime” at the end of “Lose Yourself,” putting his right hand to his head, and dropping down on his left knee while Dr. Dre sat at a white piano and tapped out a melody familiar from Tupac’s “I Ain’t Mad at Cha” — a flash of radicalizm and a jolt of elegance, a pushback and an embrace, an implicit raised fist and a wink. And after the show was over, an NFL spokesperson said that the league knew all along that Eminem would kneel. Is it still protest if it’s been signed off on and approved?,

			,Contributing writer,Mitsuhiro Hidaka never wanted to be a pop music revolutionary. He simply wanted to help a younger generation find their way into Japan’s entertainment industry without being forced to compromise their talents.,“I talked to a young dancer, someone who had a good look and was really good at dancing. I heard him singing karaoke, and he even sounded great singing, too,” Hidaka, better known by his artist name Sky-Hi, tells The Japan Times. “I said to him, ‘Someone like you who can sing and dance, which could fulfill a weakness of Japanese entertainment, should become an artist.’ Then he told me that he needed to change himself to suit the style of the management agency if he wanted to be successful.”,
,The young talent’s frustration seemed to strike a chord with Hidaka.,“I see these young talented people, but because they can’t find an agency that fits what they want to do, they go through tough times or just quit the entertainment industry,” he says. “I had the same issues decades ago, nothing has changed in the years since. So I made my own company, for the younger generations.”,The 35-year-old Sky-Hi (stylized in all caps) launched , (Be My Self Group) in September 2020 to assist artists in pursuing their own path to success in line with a modern, international mindset. Having been active in J-pop for more than two decades, primarily as a member of the Avex-helmed group AAA and, simultaneously, as a solo artist leaning more into hip-hop since 2013, he’s well aware of how slow the industry can be in adapting to global trends.,More importantly, he doesn’t want the gifts of promising young Japanese to go to waste, especially now that alternative paths to stardom have popped up in neighboring South Korea, which has benefitted — and profited — from an influx of talent from this country.,“Things could be better here if we changed the outdated aspects of our industry,” Sky-Hi says. As CEO of BMSG, one such area of change has been how his agency approaches the internet. While the major players in Japan’s music world have tried to avoid dealing with the web, Sky-Hi leaned into it by pushing his stable of talent on YouTube and other streaming platforms. This has led to him signing an impressive roster that includes rappers Novel Core and edhiii boi, the neo-city pop vocalist Aile The Shota and, BMSG’s biggest act so far, the male idol group Be:First (also stylized in all caps).,Taku Takahashi, who is one-third of the group m-flo and a prolific producer in his own right, says Sky-Hi is “changing how the industry once worked.”,“He’s not a talker,” Takahashi says, “he really does it and commits himself to what he is doing.”,That drive Takahashi praises comes from a personal place. As a teen, Hidaka struggled to stand out in a crowded musical landscape. He joined entertainment powerhouse Johnny & Associates in 2001, to ,. He largely performed as a backup dancer and made a single appearance on TV, barely visible on the left-hand side of the screen. He left the company a few years later.,While critical of the music industry, Sky-Hi still chooses his answers carefully when speaking and avoids putting blame on individual entities, balancing the traits of a wannabe revolutionary and an established player in the system he hopes to change.,“What’s important to BMSG is that each artist has his own style and musical preferences,” he says. “I can feel and see styles in each of our artists. BMSG doesn’t have a specific style or musical preference, but rather, each artist brings his own style and I personally enjoy their choices. That is the baseline of who we are.”,This stands in contrast to other talent agencies, which try to push a specific image tying into their brand strategy. This guiding principle may come from the idea that he wasn’t able to try everything he wanted to as a young talent, though he did have the chance to explore hip-hop after joining Avex.,His beliefs on artistic freedom have been a running theme in his work — his 2018 solo album “Japrison” means exactly what you think it does. It has also pushed Sky-Hi to take BMSG in interesting directions, specifically with “The First,” a 2021 reality talent competition that streamed on Hulu, one that he personally spent ¥100 million to create.,“If we stay on this path, I fear that, in Japan, we will never get high-quality dance and vocal groups,” Sky-Hi declared on ,, which doubled as a mission statement for BMSG. “Even with great talent and creativity, (performers) never get the chance to show their talents to the world.”,The idea for “The First” came from the recent popularity of “survival shows,” originally via South Korean programs but recently through domestic ones that have helped birth popular outfits such as , and ,.,
,
,“For an audition program or a survival program to be successful or well-received, they often seem to create such a program where they may not consider the participants’ mental health or their future,” he says, adding that he wanted to make a show focused on the participants’ growth and self-awareness as artists and human beings. “I know from my past experiences in this industry how mentally tough it is to chase after a false image once it’s created. Therefore, if you can be true to yourself and to the public from the beginning, you don’t need to lie to yourself.”,The show was a hit and resulted in the creation of the seven-member Be:First, who have enjoyed chart success and been tagged as a “trend to watch” in 2022.,“The kids are trying hard, and Sky-Hi is really passionate about what he’s doing, it inspires me,” says Takahashi, who has produced songs for Be:First. “I’m not in the team, but when I’m working with them, I try to put everything into it. Like my own family.”,While Sky-Hi says he’s still trying to get the hang of being the guy in the top seat at an agency — juggling everything can be a challenge, though he makes sure he spends at least 15 minutes a day speaking with a different artist on the roster — he believes he is making headway on his ultimate goal in challenging the Japanese music industry’s reluctance to change.,“For BMSG, the timing was the key element for us to get more exposure among Japanese media. During the pandemic, many talent management agencies faced crises in business opportunities,” he says. “The stories and words I expressed were somewhat related to their situation and were probably easier for them to support. What I was expressing was simple, ‘Let’s make things better.’”,This may be why Sky-Hi stays upbeat while talking about the obstacles in his current path. (Although he could also be coming off the high of a recently announced collaboration with 3Racha, a subgroup of the popular South Korean unit Stray Kids.) Next on his agenda: strengthening J-pop’s visual elements and fixing the music charts so that they more accurately represent the country’s musical tastes. Big challenges for sure, but he’s just being true to himself, and what he wants out of the country’s music industry.,For more information about Sky-Hi and BMSG, visit ,.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Tel Liyanto wasn’t alive during Japan’s 1980s boom, but she loves the “timeless” city pop hits of the era, now going viral thanks to a new generation of young, international fans.,The glamorous soundtrack that accompanied the country’s economic miracle is exploding in popularity decades after its upbeat synths, influenced by soft rock, boogie and soul, first hit the airwaves.,
,The retro genre is so hot that Canadian star The Weeknd sampled the 1983 track “Midnight Pretenders” on his latest release, and record companies are racing to reissue long-forgotten city pop vinyl.,“It’s like disco: a nostalgic sound, but also modern,” says Liyanto, a 27-year-old from Indonesia who works for a creative agency, as she dances to city pop in a Tokyo bar.,“I listen to it when I’m dancing, I listen to it when I’m chilling,” she says.,From its origins in niche online music circles, the revival was amplified by YouTube’s algorithm, which detects when a song is being liked and shared and recommends it worldwide.,The most popular tracks, like Mariya Takeuchi’s “Plastic Love,” have tens of millions of views on YouTube.,The song’s funk bassline and flamboyant brass have the optimistic vibe of “Club Tropicana” by Wham! — but the soaring Japanese vocals tell another story.,“Since the day I was heartbroken, I’ve been living life with day and night reversed,” Takeuchi sings in the track that commenters call a “hidden gem.”,“Why am I suddenly listening to Japanese ’80s pop? And why is it so good?” wrote one.,Kei Notoya, a 33-year-old DJ, was hooked by city pop the first time he heard it at a university party.,He has since collected around 3,000 records, some of which sell out in seconds from his online shop Tokyo Condition.,“Japanese music back then copied a lot of American rock, soul, R&B,” he says. “It sounds fresh, but at the same time, familiar.,“People who weren’t born can feel the energy, the atmosphere of the ’80s and ’70s by listening to these songs.”,The buzz has prompted Japanese record companies to upload more of their back catalog onto streaming services.,But the huge number of “slept-on” songs — ignored for many years, but recently unearthed by music lovers — keeps interest in the genre alive, Notoya says.,He boasts of “new finds every week” in second-hand record shops, and released the compilation “Tokyo Glow” in December.,
,
,The Weeknd’s sample of Tomoko Aran’s hit on his new track “,” is “the most mainstream example of any Japanese older music being introduced to a wider audience”, says Patrick St. Michel, a Japan-based music writer and contributor to The Japan Times.,“Midnight Pretenders” was reissued on vinyl last year along with other city pop favorites including “Plastic Love,” which has also been refreshed with a modern-day music video by record label Warner Japan.,Gary Ieong, the co-owner of White Noise Records in Hong Kong, says that while fans prefer hunting for original city pop presses, the “Plastic Love” reissue has been “really popular” in his shop.,Young people who listen to the song on YouTube want to buy the reissue “as a souvenir, or for the artwork,” he says.,The music is also popular on TikTok, where fans match their favorite tracks to anime-style sunset illustrations or dance along in ’80s clothes.,But beyond cheesy fun, new listeners are also drawn to city pop by the “element of melancholy lurking within,” says St. Michel.,“That’s something that creeps through all the city pop songs and gains them virality. There’s something sad about it too — it’s not pure hedonism.”,Nothing lasts forever though, and early trendsetters who started getting into city pop online in the 2010s are already moving on, St. Michel says.,They have “already kind of said clearly, ‘It’s already over for us, we’re moving on to the ’90s’.”,“It’s like a race to find what internet crowds will be into. But they’re the ones to decide,” he adds. “That’s the beauty of it.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Trends come and go in Japan, but the Eurobeat goes on.,The BPM-busting style of dance music is encoded in J-pop’s DNA, and the sights and sounds associated with the genre have helped define how people remember the 1990s. Picture huge clubs full of revelers showing off their , dance skills while hit songs produced by Tetsuya Komuro block out any worries about post-bubble economic woes.,
,“They were very happy times,” Akira Yokota, better known as DJ Boss (stylized in all caps), tells The Japan Times as he waxes nostalgic over the dawn of the Heisei Era (1989-2019). “In the ’90s, the bubble collapsed. But at the clubs, nobody felt that until the middle of the decade. It was still a vibrant time for nightlife.”,Yokota, the man behind the decks at such popular clubs as Maharaja and Velfarre, remains devoted to Eurobeat and has been a core player in the “,” series since 2000. Started by major label Avex in 1990, these compilations arrived monthly for decades, delivering the newest songs to hungry audiences in Japan even as the genre became passe overseas.,While the series now sees an annual release — “The Best Of Super Eurobeat 2021” arrived in late January — Yokota continues to highlight the work of familiar Eurobeat makers (Dave Rodgers, Cherry) along with fresh faces (Italian Eurobeat idols Honey Hime). He says the process for creating the compilation remains the same — they contact Italian producers and ask them to create new songs, while the Japan side shares examples of what’s popular here to help shape the tracks.,“For the 2021 release, I gave examples like Yoasobi or Ado, and, of course, BTS is popular all over the world right now,” he says on specific references for the 2021 offering. And while a bass line on Cherry’s “Life Is a Beat” echoes Billie Eilish, for example, it soon gives way to a synth chug that could have dropped in 1996. “Super Eurobeat” remains committed to the sound.,That might be the most fitting approach for a new decade, seeing as Eurobeat has, in recent years, enjoyed newfound attention and influence. Thanks to anime and memes, the hyperactive sound of the genre has connected with , (Generation Z), with young musicians incorporating elements of Eurobeat into their own songs. Don’t call it a renaissance though — Eurobeat never really left.,
,Eurobeat’s Japanese adventure began in the 1980s.,“It was things like Dead Or Alive, Kylie Minogue, those were playing in the discos,” Yokota says, adding that many Japanese acts covered European hits and turned them into chart gold. This is how hi-NRG tracks from German and Italian creators found their way into Japanese clubs.,One fan was Avex founder Max Matsuura. Some of the earliest releases on his Avex Trax record label in the ’90s were compilations of this European dance music — dubbed “Eurobeat” — including “Super Eurobeat,” made with assistance from Italian artist Giancarlo Pasquini, better known by his stage name Dave Rodgers.,The compilations proved foundational for the decade’s homegrown music. “Avex knew that there was a bond between the two, before anyone else did, so they focused on it,” Yokota says. This manifested itself initially by more Japanese acts covering Eurobeat, but changed the game when producer Tetsuya Komuro drew from the high-BPM style to create songs for artists such as TRF, Namie Amuro and Globe. They became smashes that helped define the very idea of J-pop — a term only introduced at the start of the ’90s.,Eurobeat was everywhere: in clubs, cars and karaoke rooms. It shaped many mid-’90s hits, including Johnny & Associates pop group V6’s chart-topping single “,” in 1996. It also popped up in anime, like the racing series “Initial D” (1998), and was the soundtrack to early rhythm-centered arcade games from Konami’s Bemani imprint.,As big as the sound got, Yokota remembers the situation changing as the years went on.,“Around 1997 or ’98, all of the clubs and discos started disappearing,” he says. “As those venues went away, there was no real method or way to tell people about the music.”,
,When people remember the early days of the Heisei Era, para para dancing tends to be the go-to choreography to recall (and mock) the times — kind of like John Travolta’s pointy disco fingers of the ’70s or the running man from the ’80s. Most of the para para routines involve complicated arm choreography while your feet simply step from left to right in time with the beat. You would see rows of young women showing off specific moves to certain tracks on the stages at the clubs, all completely synchronized in their movements.,While an important part of the Eurobeat experience in Japan, Yokota believes the elevation of para para, among other things, took focus away from the music.,“That prompted a shift from the tracks themselves to the culture. Eurobeat started becoming more about high school girls dancing to it, or fashion trends like ,,” he says, adding there are plenty of positives to that, but it ultimately drew attention away from what he was most passionate about.,While the scene still had enough fans to warrant the release of new “Super Eurobeat” compilations, by the early 2000s people associated it less with cool clubs and more with gimmicks like actor Takuya Kimura ,.,“Trends come and go,” Yokota says. “So, when the trend ends, you’re left with people thinking that the music is from a time we aren’t listening to anymore. It just becomes old.”,
,The computer game , (known as Needy Streamer Overload outside of Japan) is the most 2020s thing around at the moment. Players assume the role of a female livestreamer whose aim is to deliver content to and interact with her followers, a commentary on our social-media-fed need for approval. And its theme tune, “Internet Overdose,” is pure Eurobeat bliss — complete with a ,. As the game has become more popular in recent weeks, “Internet Overdose” by producer Aiobahn and featuring vocalist Kotoko, has enjoyed a lot of attention, including appearances on the Spotify Japan Viral 50 chart.,“There were no specific directions from the staff about what I could do,” Aiobahn, whose real name is Kim Min-Seung, tells The Japan Times. He wasn’t sure why he made Eurobeat part of the song — he also references hardcore sounds from such ’90s artists as Dune, Blumchen and Paul Elstak. He credits it to his “stream of consciousness,” and how good it all sounded.,Perhaps it’s just time for it to come back? Yokota worried that the culture surrounding Eurobeat would make the music feel old, but in the internet age, time is pretty much irrelevant since everything is always on offer.,Yokota began to sense the second wave of Eurobeat after J-pop group Da Pump dropped “U.S.A.” in 2018. A semi-cover of Italian project ,, it , before mutating into a year-defining megahit. “It’s kind of corny, but cool, right?” he asks, admitting he was baffled as to why Da Pump were covering the track in the first place. “The people behind the scenes were probably thinking more about what it could do in the social media age.”,Indeed, the popularity of “Initial D” and its exciting race sequences has led people to place the Eurobeat songs from the show and set them to videos (albeit tongue-in-cheek) of , on YouTube and TikTok.,“I think people born in the Heisei Era and who have an , (nerdlike disposition) remember all these elements,” says Aiobahn, who grew up a fan of “Initial D” and V6’s “Take Me Higher.”,Yokota shouldn’t fret, though, because the music is also being absorbed in new ways. Alongside the meme compilations are user-created playlists featuring , and sometimes specific titles — “,,” “,” — featuring hours of pure Eurobeat.,Younger acts like Manon and Starkids are drawing from Eurobeat, while even more creators are getting in on the internet-centric style of “hyperpop,” a mish-mash of styles that often imitates the frantic BPM of Eurobeat.,Yokota says he’ll stay focused on supporting the “Super Eurobeat” series, which could see new life if he plays his cards right.

			,AFP-JIJI,Eddie Jones insists England knows what it has to do in order to deny France a Grand Slam and finish the Six Nations with a flourish.,France has been the top team in this season’s Six Nations, but had to endure some nervous moments in a 13-9 win over Wales that kept it on track for an unbeaten campaign.,
,England, by contrast, will head to Paris following a record 32-15 loss at home against Ireland, a match that saw England’s Charlie Ewels sent off just 82 seconds into the action.,“We’ve beaten France in our last two games, so we’ve got a pretty good idea of how to play against them, but certainly Wales did really well on Friday night,” Jones said.,“Wales lost the kicking in the first 20 and to beat France you have to out-kick them. That’s the first thing.,“Then you have to out-fight them around the ruck, which Wales did.”,“Wales are a really hard, tough team and we have to replicate them at the ruck and keep (scrumhalf) Antoine Dupont quiet.”,France is now just 80 minutes away from its first Grand Slam since 2010 and Jones, who guided England to its most recent clean sweep in the tournament with a 31-21 victory in Paris six years ago, hopes the pressure surrounding Saturday’s match falls on Les Bleus.,“For them to be playing for the Grand Slam, I remember going there in 2016 going for the Grand Slam and because it’s such a huge thing in European rugby, it does become something in their head,” the Australian said.,“And the only way we can make that live in their head a bit more is to play with such an intensity, and such ferociousness that we put them on the back foot. I think we’ve seen it in a few games.,“Look, France are a good team, don’t get me wrong. But like any team — even the great All Black teams winning at 90%, on your day if you can get stuck into them physically, take away their strengths, you can cause them problems.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,STAFF WRITER,Jordan Skopp, founder of the Foul Ball Safety Now! campaign that is urging MLB to add more protective netting at its games, was troubled by what he heard coming out of the negotiations between MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association during the league’s lockout.,Or rather, by what he did not hear.,
,There was plenty of talk about luxury taxes, service time and various other issues during the 99-day lockout, which ended Thursday afternoon. What Skopp and others in his campaign wanted to hear more about, however, was how MLB plans to protect its fans when the games begin in the major and minor leagues this spring.,Skopp, a Brooklyn-based realtor who roots for the New York Mets, has spent years advocating for MLB to install more netting in stadiums to protect fans from being seriously injured by foul balls hit into the stands. He has compiled research and tried to contact officials in baseball and also politicians regarding the issue. Skopp does not mince words and says it is unacceptable that MLB continues to run the risk of allowing its fans to be seriously injured by foul balls.,“You would think the Major League Baseball owners would say, ‘We cannot allow our employees to hit baseballs that crush the heads of baseball fans,'” Skopp told The Japan Times. “And on the other side, we have the players union, which represents the rank-and-file of all the players. Why would they allow their rank-and-file to go to work knowing that one of their members, sooner rather than later, could crush the head of a baseball fan?”,The issue of foul balls rocketing into the stands and causing injury is hardly a new one. Alan Fish, a 14-year-old boy, died after being struck by a foul ball while attending a game at Dodger Stadium in 1970. In 2018, 79-year-old Linda Goldbloom died as a result of being hit by a ball at the same venue.,There have been many other instances of fans being struck, though no reported deaths, in the years between those tragedies.,An investigation by U.S. television network NBC reported that over 800 fans were injured by balls during MLB games from 2012 to 2019. That report was focused only on MLB, meaning it did not account for incidents at minor league parks.,Skopp, in addition to petitioning MLB owners, says he has also taken the campaign to extend netting to stadium operators in the minors.,“I did a survey about a year ago at this time where I called 100 minor league ballparks,” he said. “I found out at least 42 still had no nets past dugouts. Where do things get crushed, including children? Past the end of dugouts.”,In 2019, MLB announced all 30 clubs would add more protective netting before the 2020 season. Skopp, however, is not yet satisfied with the league’s efforts.,He’s been working on getting the word out to the public whenever he can through his campaign.,He called a news conference early last year to allow victims to tell their stories and is working on a book about the issue in which he promises more testimonials.,“The evidence file is getting thicker by the day,” he said.,In June 2021, Skopp hired a plane to circle Dozer Park in Peoria, Illinois, while flying a banner that read in part, “Wake up Dozer! Nets!,” before a minor league game.,In addition to his frustration over MLB’s lack of action, Skopp also feels media members should speak up.,“Nobody has resigned from baseball or from baseball writing,” he said. “I’m not saying it’s just the writers. It could be the broadcasters, it’s the players, it’s the owners. Those are the four major groups that clearly should have expressed themselves enough.,“They probably have some conversation with their family on where to sit as the baseball players do.”,As Skopp followed the MLB negotiations, he lamented the lack of progress that has been made to protect fans since even before he took up the cause, but vowed to keep advocating, even if little was gained during baseball’s recent labor talks.,“Fifty-two years later, we’re still in the same place,” Skopp said. “Almost 52 years since Alan Fish.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,Former ,Daieisho (2-0) used a powerful thrusting attack to defeat Terunofuji in the last bout of the day at Edion Arena Osaka, which is hosting a grand tournament with spectators for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.,The maegashira, who had beaten Terunofuji (1-1) in September, managed to keep the Mongolian-born yokozuna away from his belt, knocking him off balance and shoving him out from behind.,“My opening charge wasn’t great, but I was able to keep going,” Daieisho said. “I’ll try to keep it up tomorrow.”,January winner Mitakeumi was too strong for the other No. 1, Ura (0-2), pushing him out to stay undefeated as an ozeki.,Following a strong opening hit, Mitakeumi fended off a leg-pick attempt by his slippery opponent and bundled him over the straw bales.,Takakeisho (1-1) was unable to establish his preferred pushing sumo against giant No. 2 Ichinojo (1-1), who halted the ozeki at the opening clash and forced him out with a series of strong shoves.,“I just want to keep moving forward and good things will happen,” Ichinojo said.,Shodai (0-2) never looked to be in the contest against ,Takanosho (1-1), who quickly secured victory via push out.,Having strung together one lackluster tournament after another, Shodai has given no indication he can avoid demotion at the 15-day meet.,Abi (1-1) earned his first win as a sekiwake, blowing away No. 2 Tamawashi (1-1) from the jump with his trademark thrusting sumo.,Sekiwake Wakatakakage (2-0) reeled off another impressive win in his first meet at sumo’s third-highest rank, quickly crushing out No. 3 Onosho (1-1).,New komusubi Hoshoryu dropped to 0-2 in his debut tournament among the three elite ,ranks below yokozuna, after he was thrown down by No. 4 Kiribayama (2-0).,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Several observers have expressed disappointment at Asia’s “weak” response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including by ASEAN, India and Indonesia.,My old friend and astute observer of regional affairs, Brad Glosserman, added his voice in these pages recently. He noted that in the U.N. General Assembly’s overwhelming condemnation of Russia, many Asian countries — Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam — chose to abstain.,
,Let me stipulate upfront that Russia’s actions are illegal, immoral and possibly amount to war crimes. That will be of little consolation if Ukraine is reduced to ashes with tens of thousands killed or the world is incinerated in a nuclear war. Deleterious consequences for Australia, India and Japan include U.S. and European distraction from the Indo-Pacific, a stronger Moscow–Beijing axis and China as the big strategic victor of the NATO–Russia clash.,When India was a British colony, the U.K. defense strategy was to deny control of the reverse Himalayan slopes to any potential hostile power as that would confer immense strategic advantages to it. Tibet and Nepal served as critical buffer zones to this effect. After independence, India’s then-prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, ignored this inherited strategic wisdom, gave his blessing to China’s control of Tibet and paid the price in the military rout by China in the 1962 border war.,Similarly, if China were to conquer Taiwan, the geostrategic repercussions for Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and others would be grave. If China is engaged in a long game of displacing the U.S. as the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific and it’s a matter of when, not if, we choose to fight and not kowtow to it, the key question would be: Do we go to war as soon as China attacks, or delay and risk China’s relative power being still stronger down the line?,That effectively is the choice Vladimir Putin faced. Russia has had its nose rubbed repeatedly in the dirt of the former Soviet Union's historic defeat in the Cold War, its interests ignored, its buffer against NATO continually shrunk and its protests contemptuously dismissed. For reasons of history and geography, Russians regard the prospect of NATO troops in Ukraine as an existential threat. By contrast, it’s not part of core U.S. strategic interests and there will be no NATO planes over Ukraine nor boots on the ground.,There is unbroken continuity in the Russian grievance about NATO’s eastward expansion from Mikhail Gorbachev through Boris Yeltsin to Putin.,According to declassified documents from the National Security Archive published in 2017, there were multiple assurances to Soviet leaders from U.S., U.K., French and German leaders against NATO expansion that were then serially violated. The current CIA director, William Burns, was posted in Moscow when he wrote a memo in 1995, saying, “hostility to NATO expansion is almost universally felt across the domestic political spectrum here.” Burns returned to Moscow as ambassador and on Feb. 1, 2008, sent a cable to Washington (published by WikiLeaks) titled: “Nyet means nyet: Russia’s NATO enlargement red lines.”,Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned him that the issue of NATO membership for Ukraine “could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even civil war, which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene.” Despite the blunt warning, on April 3, 2008, NATO’s Bucharest Summit Declaration affirmed that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of NATO.”,Whenever this history of broken assurances is brought up, Americans get all lawyerly (“put it in writing”), just as they did in the Vietnam War vis-a-vis the 1954 Geneva Accords. They also ignore their own history of breaches of international law and principles: rejection of the World Court’s adverse verdict for the destabilization of Nicaragua in 1986, invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 and exit from the Iran nuclear deal. There are parallels between NATO actions in Kosovo in 1999 and Russian actions in Crimea in 2014; and between U.S. rejection of Cuba’s sovereign right to enter into a security alliance with the Soviet Union and station Soviet missiles in 1962 and Russian rejections of comparable rights asserted for Ukraine.,In a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February 2007 that filled many listeners with foreboding, Putin accused the West of breaking assurances on NATO expansion. In 2008 in Georgia and again in 2014 in Ukraine, he made it clear Russia had red lines that he would not allow NATO and the EU to cross. In his address to the nation on Feb. 24 announcing the military actions against Ukraine, Putin began by highlighting the threat posed by “the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.”,On March 2, the U.K. led 38 countries in a collective state referral to the ICC of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Yet on March 5, 2020, when the ICC authorized investigation of alleged war crimes in Afghanistan by the government, Taliban and U.S. forces since 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attacked the judgment as “reckless” and issued threats against ICC personnel.,Against this history, just because some Asian countries come to different conclusions based on their particular circumstances and priorities does not make them intellectual and moral inferiors.,Glosserman holds that “The invasion of Ukraine is such an egregious violation of international rules and norms that it is almost impossible for a government that aspires to international leadership or status, and certainly a U.S. ally, to not condemn Russia.” I respectfully disagree. India and Israel, for example, are among a handful of countries with good relations with both sides. Public condemnation would diminish India’s diplomatic potential to be an honest broker and God knows we might need skilled and credible interlocutors as tensions ratchet up in the coming days and weeks.,Great powers rise and fall on the tide of history. Although no power remains great forever and none retreats forever, there’s no way to reliably judge in real time whether a great power has begun its descent into permanent decline or is merely in temporary retreat.,Geopolitical fault lines during periods of power transition are fraught with grave risks of war rooted in miscalculations of relative power. Meanwhile, the fate of lesser powers caught in the crossfire of great power contests is as much determined by the outcome of those contests as by their own efforts.,The U.S. bet the house on the end-of-history thesis and the belief that Russia as a major power had permanently declined. Putin may well have made a fateful error in choosing war as the means to break out of the relentless strategic encirclement by NATO. If the invasion proves the American assessment right and destroys Russia’s pretensions to great power status, Putin will pay the ultimate price.,But if defeat in the Cold War was a cyclical blip in Russia’s great power status, then Ukraine’s NATO ambitions that were non-negotiable before the war will become negotiable. And the likes of India could well have a critical role to bring Europe and the world back from the brink.,Ramesh Thakur is emeritus professor in the Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University and a former United Nations assistant secretary general.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Project Syndicate,Instability is the new worldwide normal. From Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions in the Taiwan Strait to the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, the challenges the world faces are as varied as they are volatile. But, despite their transnational nature, building resilience to them must happen, first and foremost, within the confines of nation-states.,To be sure, effective multilateral cooperation has an important role to play. But intensifying geopolitical rivalries limit its potential. Moreover, even if countries did work together, their ability to address destabilizing global and regional trends and imbalances would depend substantially on the work that each country is doing to strengthen financial, economic and social resilience at home.,
,But there are plenty of barriers to effective national-level action. With public trust in government sagging in much of the world, few political leaders have the political mandate or legitimacy they need to make the difficult choices that the situation requires. Widespread mistrust of media does not help matters.,Rather than address these trust deficits in an honest and sustained way, many political leaders and journalists, particularly in the West, have sought to unite their populations by framing and highlighting external threats, especially with China and Russia. This is a dangerous distraction that arguably will leave the West less secure.,If countries remain on a war footing, they will dedicate insufficient attention and resources to domestic imperatives like meeting net-zero targets, bolstering demand, delivering quality health care, ensuring adequate social protections and reducing economic inequality. Without progress in these areas, discontent will only grow, undermining domestic, regional and global stability further.,China, for one, recognizes that attempting to address domestic challenges while fighting a “war of words” in the media and managing a cold war with the United States is a zero-sum game. With this in mind, in 2020 it introduced its “dual-circulation strategy,” focused on increasing China’s self-reliance and thus its ability to withstand external pressures and disruptions.,As China has begun to implement this strategy, it has also maintained a strict zero-COVID policy. This enabled it, most importantly, to keep total deaths low: Had China’s COVID-19 mortality rate matched that of the U.S., some 4 million Chinese would be dead. Instead, China recorded just a few thousand deaths from COVID-19.,Beyond saving lives, China’s zero-COVID policy enabled the country to avoid the economic drag of protracted national lockdowns, thereby facilitating a rapid recovery of production and consumption. This gave the government the confidence to implement structural-adjustment policies aimed at improving the quality of growth and advancing the goal of “common prosperity.”,For example, policymakers acted decisively to reduce risks in the real-estate sector and rein in internet-platform giants. While these reforms carried short-term costs — gross domestic product growth slowed to 4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 — full-year growth reached 8.1% (compared to 5.7% in the U.S.) and China’s current-account surplus stood at $315.7 billion (1.8% of GDP).,Further highlighting China’s commitment to addressing imbalances, the country’s macro leverage ratio (a measure of the economy’s overall indebtedness) has declined for five consecutive quarters. In 2021, the ratio fell by 7.7 percentage points, to 272.5%. For comparison, as of June 2021, the macro leverage ratio stood at 286.2% in the U.S., 416.5% in Japan and 284.3% in the eurozone.,Fiscal and monetary prudence also helped to ensure that the yuan’s value rose just 2.7% against the U.S. dollar in 2021, compared to 6.7% in 2020. Moreover, consumer prices climbed only 0.9% in 2021, compared to 7% in the U.S.,Producer prices did rise sharply in 2021, with annual growth peaking at 13.5% in October, owing to commodity-market volatility and supply-chain disruptions. But the government’s stabilization policies are already working to counteract this trend, reflected in the subsequent slowdown in producer price inflation, which stood at 9.1% in January.,And China is just getting started. In the quest for common prosperity, the government will continue to use a combination of market incentives and fiscal transfers both to expand the economic pie sustainably and to ensure that gains are allocated more fairly. Voluntary charitable contributions will also make a difference here.,A second priority is to achieve a more balanced and disciplined use of capital, with the help of both incentives (such as to bolster productivity growth) and regulations (to protect against speculative practices or monopoly prices). As part of this effort, China is encouraging the use of long-term equity capital, instead of debt.,China’s government is also working to secure adequate supplies of strategic natural resources, energy, commodities, industrial materials and agricultural products, to shield itself against a hostile geopolitical environment. Furthermore, it is improving its systems for predicting, managing and mitigating major financial or nonfinancial risks, including low-probability, high-impact Black Swan events and slow-moving Grey Rhino risks like climate change and biodiversity loss. And it remains committed to reaching a carbon-emissions peak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.,It is an ambitious agenda and success is not guaranteed. China’s own track record shows that, in devising and implementing bold policies, missteps are inevitable. But China also has a long history of learning from its mistakes and adapting to changing conditions. In any case, at a time of profound uncertainty and open hostility, China has little choice but to prepare for the worst. Fortunately for the rest of the world, whatever progress China makes in addressing internal imbalances will only bolster global stability.,Andrew Sheng, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong, is a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.

			,Central to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s calculations as he weighed the invasion of Ukraine was a belief that he would encounter an enfeebled and divided West. It was a reasonable expectation given political developments in those countries in recent months and the seeming discord that surfaced among them as they studied his preparations. He was wrong, however.,The West, and virtually the entire world, has united to oppose the invasion of Ukraine. While many leaders deserve credit for helping to forge this coalition, a good deal of the credit goes to U.S. President Joe Biden, who has demonstrated remarkable acuity in handling this crisis.,
,He and his team overcame deep fissures in U.S. domestic politics to build that international front, wrong-footed Putin and prevailed in the information war. Biden is laying out the terms for a new era in international relations, one that he believes will be defined by the struggle between democracy and authoritarian governments.,While there was considerable public debate and great skepticism about Putin’s intentions, the U.S. has been steadfast in its insistence that an invasion was planned. To great risk, the U.S. revealed intelligence that burned off the cloud of doubt and confusion that Moscow hoped to use to win the information war and denied Russia the advantage of surprise.,Biden and his team used that intelligence and a calibrated strategic approach to engage allies and partners, and to identify and pursue the consensus that would unify the West in response to any aggression. Working behind the scenes, Washington has let other governments move at their own pace: For example, Europe was first to announce that Russian banks would be barred from the SWIFT financial messaging system. The result has been the creation of a coalition that not only surprised Putin, but many in the West as well. It has strengthened NATO and burnished its appeal to other European countries.,His team has worked with the Japanese government to ensure that it is part of this coalition. While condemnation of the invasion was obligatory, joining the sanctions effort was not. Tokyo has traditionally been slow to use sanctions, insisting instead on the need to maintain channels of communication with target countries.,This logic has been especially useful when dealing with Putin, with whom even conservative politicians engaged in hopes of reaching a solution to the Northern Territories dispute. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was one of the few Western leaders to attend the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, held as another crisis brewed in Ukraine, one that would result in the annexation of Crimea.,The speed with which all parties agreed on sanctions and the severity of those measures is an example of the success of Biden’s strategy. The shocking shift in German security policy — announcing that Berlin will send military weapons to Ukraine and that it will increase defense spending by €100 billion this year and reach the goal of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense — is another. The stunning United Nations General Assembly vote of 141-5 against the invasion is yet another.,These achievements are even more impressive given the damage that his predecessor Donald Trump did to U.S. alliances, multilateralism and the rules-based order. The most important lesson of the last week has been that international cooperation and coordinated action in pursuit of shared values and principles are essential to the survival of that order and to the peace and security it creates. The protection of national interests is best achieved through cooperative actions, not myopic or narrowly defined nationalism.,Just as important has been Biden’s restraint. He made clear before the invasion began that the U.S. would not commit military forces. He has talked tough, but he has not drawn intemperate red lines. When Putin brandished his nuclear arsenal in a seeming warning that he was prepared to use those weapons, the U.S. by contrast canceled a planned missile test to avoid any risk of an accident.,And throughout the crisis, Biden has focused attention on where it belongs. He has applauded the heroism and resilience of the Ukrainian people and condemned Putin for his aggression. He has not made it about himself or put himself at the center of the unfolding crisis.,Instead, he has framed this as a struggle between the forces of good and evil, as when he closed his State of the Union address in Washington Tuesday evening by noting that “Now is the hour. Our moment of responsibility. Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged … . We will save democracy.”,For 70 years, the world has looked to the U.S. for leadership in international crises. In recent years, there has been growing doubt about both the capacity and the will of the U.S. president to play that role.,These questions have arisen as power within the world is being redistributed: Indeed, that shift is driving some of the concern. New divisions of labor and responsibility are needed; some are being created. But there remains a critical need for leadership, albeit leadership of a new kind. The world is fortunate to have Biden in the White House as it grapples with a world in transition.,The Japan Times Editorial Board,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Yoon Suk-yeol prevailed in South Korea’s presidential election Wednesday, eking out a minuscule margin of victory in a bitterly fought campaign.,The return of a conservative to the Blue House could transform South Korean foreign policy and offers a chance for a turnaround in Japan’s relations with its neighbor. It won’t be easy, however: Yoon is an inexperienced politician, leads a deeply divided country and the progressive party maintains its grip on the National Assembly.,
,The Japanese government should do all it can to be a good partner for South Korea and forge a productive and forward-looking relationship with Seoul. But it is up to South Korea to start that process and make it possible.,Yoon is a former prosecutor who made his reputation investigating and convicting former President Park Geun-hye, charges that lead to her impeachment and propelled Moon Jae-in to the presidency as her replacement. Yoon consolidated his credentials by investigating some of Moon’s closest aides, including Cabinet ministers. He became a conservative darling when he resigned and became a critic of the president.,Political inexperience did not keep him from winning the nomination of the main opposition People Power Party. Yoon promised to stop corruption, ever fertile ground in a country wracked by a deep and persistent sense of inequality and political favoritism.,He faced off against Lee Jae-myung, the former governor of Gyeonggi, South Korea’s largest province, who was the progressive Democratic Party candidate. (The Constitution restricts South Korean presidents to a single five-year term.) Yoon won 48.6% of the vote, while Lee collected just 47.8%, a gap of less than 1% — the closest presidential election in South Korean history, even though 77% of eligible voters cast ballots.,While the margin of victory was razor thin, Yoon’s win was expected. While neither candidate was especially popular and the campaign was marked by smears, the ballot was a referendum on the Moon record and voter dissatisfaction was high. South Koreans are fatigued by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, concerned and angered about rising inequality, shrinking job opportunities, astronomical housing prices and a series of scandals. A vote for Yoon was, for many, a protest vote.,In his victory speech, Yoon said he would work with opposition parties to overcome the divisions that blight South Korean politics. He promised to make national unity a priority. He could prove his sincerity by urging prosecutors, a notoriously independent and unruly force, to avoid going after his predecessor, which would be a break with recent practices. (His power to control prosecutors is limited, but he can make his preferences known.),His domestic agenda is clear. Yoon must ensure that South Korea’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is equitably distributed and see that more of the populace feels as though its economic prospects are improving. He said that he will build 2.5 million housing units to ease that crunch and will make sure that 300,000 of them are available to young buyers. Like many conservatives, he said that he will loosen regulations on businesses, incentivize investment financing and promote labor flexibility.,The most drastic shift is likely to be foreign policy. A neophyte in this area, he has surrounded himself with longtime conservative advisers who are well known in Tokyo and Washington. The most basic shift will come in Seoul’s approach to Pyongyang, which will trigger a series of resulting changes.,The Moon administration, argued Yoon, made dialogue with North Korea “an end in itself.” This created tension with the Biden administration, which is far more skeptical of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and because that policy pushed Moon closer to China — he hoped Beijing could pressure Kim to talk — despite an increasingly fraught U.S.-China relationship.,Yoon will prioritize denuclearization over inter-Korean relations, which will better align his administration with its ally in Washington. He also said that he seeks “strategic clarity,” or closer ties to the U.S. Yoon believes that strength is the prerequisite to serious negotiations, which portends more joint military drills with its ally as well as increasing South Korea’s military strength.,Those policies will also align Seoul more closely with Tokyo, which has been concerned about Moon’s readiness to accommodate Pyongyang. Yoon has said that he wants to build a “future-oriented” relationship with Japan, one modeled after that forged by former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. Yoon said that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will be the second leader he meets, after U.S. President Joe Biden.,Kishida responded positively, reciprocating Yoon’s desire to put the bilateral relationship back on track. We too are heartened by Yoon’s rhetoric and hope that his administration will follow up.,Trust between the two countries is in short supply, however. The Japanese government will continue to insist that the 1965 normalization treaty set the terms for our relationship and will expect its counterpart in Seoul to honor its provisions. That means an end to calls for compensation in the forced labor lawsuits and settling the comfort women controversy.,Japan should be ready to discuss South Korea’s return to export control white lists. South Korea’s bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership is another issue that could be a springboard to better relations. Resolving all these problems is unrealistic; managing them is not.,Most critically, Yoon will have to reject the siren song of identity politics and fight the urge to make Japan a scapegoat whenever political downturns make that convenient. He will also have to work to shape the public perception of Japan so that it is viewed as a partner.,The prospect of losing its advocate in the Blue House will infuriate North Korea and it will test the new president and his priorities. Pyongyang will try to drive a wedge between Yoon and his ally in Washington and his partner in Tokyo.,Neither Yoon, Biden nor Kishida should allow themselves to be provoked by Kim. Instead, they should consult and cooperate to forge the coalition that can successfully deter and contain Kim. That will provide a foundation for continuing cooperation and the strategic partnership between Tokyo and Seoul that Yoon and Kishida both say they want.,The Japan Times Editorial Board,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

				Sanctions and sanctuary: Japan responds to Russia's war in Ukraine			,
			In Washington and allied capitals, Beijing is no longer seen as a partner, but rather as a competitor if not a threat.		,
			U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently told the U.N. that the U.S. is releasing its information on a possible Russian invasion “not to start a war but to prevent one.”		,
			The Kishida administration will be better served by concentrating on and building upon positive developments with the United States.		,
			There are fears that China will use COVID-19 protocols to affect competitions, disqualifying some athletes to ensure the “proper” outcomes.		,
			With Putin's Ukraine actions, he wants nothing less than a rewriting of the rules of international order and must be resisted.		,
			China's declining birth rate looks almost impossible to reverse, a trajectory with profound implications for its economic and social prospects.		,
			The year's performance is a good sign as the TSE prepares for a restructuring in early April that is intended to revitalize corporate governance and attract global investors.		,
			Japan should make products that it and the rest of the world need so that the nation is considered an integral partner.		,
			In recent years, new dangers have emerged such as pandemics, the threat to vulnerable supply chains, cyber attacks and the undermining of democracy.		,
			Central bankers balance two priorities: prices and employment. Unfortunately, a slowing economy generally reduces employment, which means that those two priorities compete with each other.		,Much like Russia and Europe, the world sees China trying to recreate its own hegemonic position within the Indo-Pacific region.,Even before the war, committing journalism in Putin’s regime had become a hazardous task.,The world needs a country that remains relatively neutral, maintains communication with the Kremlin and has some leverage over Russia. At this time, that country is China.,Less reported in the press is the fact that an alternative left-wing candidate, Sim Sang-jung, also ran, splitting the South Korean vote.,Realists predicted some kind of conflict over Ukraine. But realism’s predictions still did not describe the reality.,The Achilles heel of economic statecraft directed toward China in a potential conflict will be whether businesses would prioritize politics and security over profits.,Russia’s president is in a tight spot, isolated, with his economy crumbling. But this is only the beginning of the end.,

			,THE NEW YORK TIMES,Russia asked China to give it military equipment and support for , after Russian President Vladimir Putin began a full-scale invasion last month, according to U.S. officials.,Russia has also asked China for additional economic assistance, to help counteract the battering its economy has taken from broad sanctions imposed by the United States and European and Asian nations, according to an official.,
,U.S. officials, determined to keep secret their means of collecting the intelligence on Russia’s requests, declined to describe further the kind of military weapons or aid that Moscow is seeking. The officials also declined to discuss any reaction by China to the requests.,Chinese President Xi Jinping has strengthened a partnership with Putin and has stood by him as Russia has stepped up its military campaign, destroying cities in Ukraine and killing hundreds or thousands of civilians. U.S. officials are watching China closely to see whether it will act on any requests of aid from Russia. Jake Sullivan, White House national security adviser, is scheduled to meet Monday in Rome with Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Politburo and director of the party’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission.,Sullivan intends to warn Yang about any future Chinese efforts to bolster Russia in its war or undercut Ukraine, the United States and their partners.,“We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,” Sullivan said on CNN on Sunday.,“We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,” he said.,Sullivan did not make any explicit mention of potential military support from China, but other U.S. officials spoke about the request from Russia on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of diplomatic and intelligence matters.,
,
,Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said he had never heard of the request from Russia. “The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said, adding that Beijing wants to see a peaceful settlement. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”,The Biden administration is seeking to lay out for China the consequences of its alignment with Russia and penalties it will incur if it continues or increases its support. Some U.S. officials argue it might be possible to dissuade Beijing from ramping up its assistance to Moscow. Chinese leaders may be content to offer rhetorical support for Moscow and may not want to further enmesh themselves with Putin by providing military support for the war, those U.S. officials say.,Sullivan said China “was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something,” but added that the Chinese might not have known the full extent of the Russian leader’s plans. “It’s very possible that Putin lied to them, the same way he lied to Europeans and others,” he said.,Xi has met with Putin 38 times as national leaders, more than with any other head of state, and the two share a drive to weaken American power.,Traditionally, China has bought military equipment from Russia rather than the other way around. Russia has increased its sales of weaponry to China in recent years. But China has advanced missile and drone capabilities that Russia could use in its Ukraine campaign.,Although Russia on Sunday launched a missile barrage on a military training ground in western Ukraine that killed at least 35 people, there has been some evidence that Russian missile supplies have been running low, according to independent analysts.,Last week, the White House criticized China for helping spread Kremlin disinformation about the United States and Ukraine. In recent days, Chinese diplomats, state media organizations and government agencies have used a range of platforms and official social media accounts to amplify a conspiracy theory that says the Pentagon has been financing biological and chemical weapons labs in Ukraine. Rightwing political figures in the United States have also promoted the theory.,
,
,On Friday, Russia called a United Nations Security Council meeting to present its claims about the labs, and the Chinese ambassador to the U.N., Zhang Jun, supported his Russian counterpart.,“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter Wednesday.,China is also involved in the Iran nuclear negotiations, which have stalled because of new demands from Russia on relief from the sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to the Ukraine war.,American officials are trying to determine to what degree China would support Russia’s position in those talks. Before Russia raised the requests, officials from the nations involved had been close to clinching a return to a version of the Obama-era nuclear limits agreement from which Donald Trump withdrew. Sullivan might bring up Iran with Yang on Monday.,Current and former U.S. officials say the Rome meeting is important given the lives at stake in the Ukraine war and the possibility of Russia and China presenting a geopolitical united front against the United States and its allies in the years ahead.,“This meeting is critical and possibly a defining moment in the relationship,” said Evan Medeiros, a Georgetown University professor who was a senior Asia director on the National Security Council during the Obama administration. “I think what the U.S. is probably going to do is lay out the costs and consequences of China’s complicity and possible enabling of Russia’s invasion. I don’t think anyone in the administration has illusions that the U.S. can pull China away from Russia.”,Some U.S. officials are looking for ways to compel Xi to distance himself from Putin on the war. Others see Xi as a lost cause and prefer to treat China and Russia as committed partners, hoping that might galvanize policies and coordination among Asian and European allies to contain them both.,Chinese officials have consistently voiced sympathy for Russia during the Ukraine war by reiterating Putin’s criticism of NATO and blaming the United States for starting the conflict. They have refrained from any mention of a Russian “war” or “invasion,” even as they express general concern for the humanitarian crisis.,They mention support for “sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a common catchphrase in Chinese diplomacy, but do not say explicitly which nation’s sovereignty they support — meaning the phrase could be interpreted as backing for Ukraine or an endorsement of Putin’s claims to restoring the territory of imperial Russia.,China and Russia issued a 5,000-word statement Feb. 4 saying their partnership had “no limits” when Putin met with Xi before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Around that time, senior Chinese officials asked senior Russian officials not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Games, according to U.S. and European officials who cite a Western intelligence report.,Starting in November, American officials quietly held talks with Chinese officials, including the ambassador in Washington and the foreign minister, to discuss intelligence showing Putin’s troop buildup to persuade the Chinese to tell the Russians not to launch a war, U.S. officials said. The Chinese officials rebuffed the Americans at every meeting and expressed skepticism that Putin intended to invade Ukraine, the U.S. officials said.,
,
,CIA Director William Burns said Thursday in a Senate hearing that he believed Xi was “unsettled” by the Ukraine war.,On Tuesday, Xi repeated China’s standard talking points on the war in a video call with the leaders of France and Germany. He also said that all nations should show “maximum restraint” and that China was “deeply grieved by the outbreak of war again on the European continent,” according to a Chinese readout. He did not say Russia had started the fighting.,U.S. and European officials say large Chinese companies will most likely refrain from openly violating sanctions on Russia for fear of jeopardizing their global commerce. On Thursday, some Russian news articles and commentary questioned China’s commitment to Russia after news agencies reported that China was refusing to send aircraft parts to the country.,Russia, as U.S. officials often remind the public, has relatively few friends or allies. And officials have said Russia’s outreach to its partners is a sign of the difficulties it is encountering trying to subdue Ukraine.,As the United States and Europe have increased pressure and sanctions, Moscow has sought more aid.,In the buildup to war, Russia got assistance from Belarus, using its territory to launch part of the invasion. Minsk has also tried to help Moscow evade sanctions. Those actions prompted the European Union to impose sanctions on Belarus. The penalties would limit money flowing into Belarus from Europe and block some Belarusian banks from using the SWIFT financial messaging system.,Michael Carpenter, U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, accused Belarus of being a “co-aggressor” and having “stabbed your neighbor in the back,” referring to Ukraine.,Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said his military will not join in the war. But Russia has launched missiles from Belarus and evacuated some injured Russian soldiers to hospitals in that country.,Syrian President Bashar Assad, who owes his government’s survival to Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, also declared support for Moscow’s invasion. Russia has tried to recruit Syrian fighters to join the Ukraine war, according to the Pentagon.,Although there are no details of how many recruits Moscow has enlisted or if they have arrived in Ukraine, American officials said it was an indicator of the strategic and tactical problems that have plagued Russian commanders.,Before the start of the war, European officials said, Russian military contractors with experience fighting in Syria and Libya secretly entered eastern Ukraine to help lay the groundwork for the invasion.,

			,REUTERS,Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine were stepping up on Monday, with Ukrainian and Russian negotiators set to talk again after both sides cited progress, even after Russia attacked a base near the Polish border and fighting raged elsewhere.,A barrage of Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a Ukrainian official said Sunday.,
,Russia’s Defense Ministry said the airstrike had destroyed a large amount of , that were being stored at the sprawling training facility, and that it had killed “up to 180 foreign mercenaries.”,The casualties reported by the two sides could not be independently verified.,Russia had warned on Saturday that convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered ,Thousands of people have died since Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation to rid Ukraine of dangerous nationalists and Nazis.,The United States, which had watched Russia’s build-up on Ukraine’s borders with mounting alarm for weeks, says it was a premeditated, unjustified and unlawful “war of choice.”,In a telephone call, U.S. President Joe Biden and France’s Emmanuel Macron underscored their commitment to holding Russia accountable for the invasion, the White House said.,U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, also discussed diplomatic efforts to stop Russia’s invasion, the State Department said.,Hopes were boosted after Russia and Ukraine gave their most upbeat assessments after weekend negotiations.,“Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,” Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video online. “I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”,A Russian delegate to the talks, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements.,Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the countries’ delegations have been speaking daily by video link and a clear aim of his negotiators was to “do everything” to arrange for him to meet Putin.,“We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win,” Zelenskyy said in a late night video speech.,
,
,While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing , and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict.,“There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,” the NATO official said, when asked if anyone from the alliance was at the base.,Heavy fighting was reported on multiple fronts.,Air raid sirens wailed across the capital Kyiv and authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.,Ukraine reported renewed airstrikes on an airport in the west and heavy shelling on Chernihiv, northeast of the capital.,Interior Ministry official Vadym Denyenko said Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the eastern Kharkiv region and around the southern town of Mykolayiv. Reporters were not able to verify those statements.,An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.,Britain’s Defence Ministry said Russian naval forces had established a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, isolating the country from international maritime trade.,In the weeks since the invasion began, , U.S. media reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials.,U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sanctions.,Asked about Russia’s request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington, said, “I’ve never heard of that.”,He said China found the current situation in Ukraine “disconcerting” and added, “We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis.”,
,
,Russia’s invasion has sent more than , across Ukraine’s borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities.,“It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,” Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, said after crossing into Romania.,Ukraine’s human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a “war crime.” She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack. None of the reports could be immediately verified.,Phosphorus munitions can be used legally in war to provide light, create smokescreens or burn buildings. But its use in populated areas has been a persistent source of controversy.,In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the British Defence Ministry said.,The city council in Mariupol said 2,187 residents had been killed since the start of the invasion. It was not possible to verify that toll.,Kharkiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment. Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, showed bombed buildings lining streets, burned-out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.,“We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city,” said Aliev, a 23-year-old musician. “We’re not going anywhere.”,In Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling, video from emergency service — and verified by reporters — showed.,Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.,Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 people had been evacuated from conflict zones, but a humanitarian convoy had been unable to reach Mariupol due to shelling.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,THE NEW YORK TIMES,The United States accurately predicted the start of , sounding the alarm that an invasion was imminent despite Moscow’s denials and Europe’s skepticism. Predicting how it might end is proving far more difficult.,There are three separate back-channel efforts underway to start negotiations — by the leaders of France; Israel and Turkey; and, in a recent entree, the new chancellor of Germany. But so far, all have hit the stone wall of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to engage in any serious negotiation. At the Pentagon, there are models of a slogging conflict that brings more needless death and destruction to a nascent European democracy, and others in which Putin settles for what some believe was his original objective: seizing a broad swath of the south and east, connecting Russia by land to Crimea, which he annexed in 2014.,
,And there is a more terrifying endgame, in which NATO nations get sucked more directly into the conflict, by accident or design. That possibility became more vivid Sunday, when Russian missiles landed in Ukraine’s western reaches, an area unscathed until now by the 18-day-old conflict, about a dozen miles from the Polish border. Russia declared over the weekend that continued efforts to funnel weapons through that region to the Ukrainian forces would make the convoys , a warning that just because the weapons are being massed on NATO territory does not mean they are immune from attack.,In interviews with senior American and European officials in recent days, there is a consensus on one point: Just as the past two weeks revealed that Russia’s vaunted military faltered in its invasion plan, the next two or three may reveal whether Ukraine can survive as a state, and negotiate an end to the war. So far, even the most basic progress, such as establishing safe humanitarian corridors, has proved elusive.,And now, what troubles officials is that Putin may double down and expand the fight beyond Ukraine.,In private, officials express concern that Putin might seek to take Moldova, another former Soviet republic that has never joined NATO and is considered particularly vulnerable. There is renewed apprehension about Georgia, which fought a war with Russia in 2008 that today seems like a test run for the far larger conflict playing out.,And there is the possibility that Putin, angered by the slowness of his offensive in Ukraine, may reach for other weapons: chemical, biological, , and cyber.,Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, mentioned that scenario Sunday, appearing on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “Part of the reason why Putin is resorting to the possibility of extreme tactics like the use of chemical weapons is because he’s frustrated because his forces aren’t advancing,’’ he said.,Sullivan said Russia would suffer “severe consequences” if it used chemical weapons, without specifying what those would be. He sidestepped the question of how Biden would react. So far, he has said the only thing that would bring the United States and its allies directly into the war would be an attack on NATO nations.,
,
,Quietly, the White House and the senior American military leadership have been modeling how they would respond to a series of escalations, including major cyberattacks on U.S. financial institutions and the , by Putin to signal to the rest of the world that he would brook no interference as he moves to crush Ukraine.,Even with Ukrainians begging for more offensive weapons and American intervention, Biden has stuck to his determination that he will not directly engage the forces of a nuclear-armed superpower.,“The idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment,” Biden said in Philadelphia to the House Democratic Caucus on Friday, “and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand — and don’t kid yourself, no matter what you all say — that’s called ‘World War III.’ OK? Let’s get it straight here.”,
,Early last week, there was a glimmer of hope that a real negotiation would begin that could establish humanitarian corridors for Ukrainians to escape the horror of intense shelling and missile attacks, and perhaps lead to peace talks. Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson and a confidant of Putin’s, said the military strikes would stop “in a moment” if Ukraine changed its constitution to accept some form of “neutrality” rather than an aspiration to join NATO; and recognized that the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk were independent states, and that Crimea was part of Russia.,In an interview with ABC News the next day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemed surprisingly open to the idea. He said he had “cooled down” on joining NATO, saying it was clear the Western alliance “is not prepared to accept Ukraine.’’ And although he did not say he could accept a carve-out of part of the country, he said that “we can discuss and find a compromise on how these territories will live on.”,But it is unclear whether Putin himself would take that deal. Separate conversations between the Russian leader and French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan all circled the same issues but left his interlocutors wondering if they were being played for time as the war ground on.,A French government account of a call to Putin on Saturday by Macron and Scholz termed it “disappointing with Putin’s insincerity: He is determined to continue the war.” U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said there was no evidence from the conversations that Putin has changed course; he remains “intent on destroying Ukraine.”,Each of those leaders checked in with senior U.S. administration officials before and after their talks with Putin, and they have been speaking with Zelenskyy as well. The United States has kept some distance — in part because no senior Russian officials will communicate with their American counterparts, including with the kind of talks that were routine in the run-up to the war.,The best hope, American and European officials say, is that Putin concludes that he must scale back his goals in the face of the , — especially the crippling of Russia’s central bank and the prospect that the country will default quickly on its obligations. Yet, should Zelenskyy actually strike a deal with Putin, that could lead to a hard decision for the United States: whether to lift any of the sanctions that it has coordinated with nations around the world.,
,Despite his military’s logistical problems, Putin appears intent on intensifying his campaign and laying siege to Kyiv, the capital; Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city; and other Ukrainian urban centers.,But even as Putin presses on with his strategy to pound Kyiv into submission, Russian air and ground forces are , senior Pentagon and U.S. intelligence officials said.,
,
,CIA Director William Burns told lawmakers last week that he is anticipating an “ugly next few weeks.”,“I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,” Burns said. He is likely to “try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,” he added.,Indeed, even as Russia widened its artillery, missile and bombing strikes Sunday, Russian and Ukrainian forces were girding for what is shaping up to be a climactic battle in Kyiv.,Putin has demonstrated in past conflicts in Syria and Chechnya a willingness not only to bomb heavily populated areas but also to use civilian casualties as leverage against his enemies. Senior U.S. officials said the coming weeks could see a long, drawn-out fight with thousands of casualties on both sides, as well as among the roughly 1.5 million citizens remaining in the city.,Russian and Ukrainian forces are now pitted in fierce street fighting in the suburban towns around the capital, while Ukrainian troops ambush the Russians with Javelin anti-tank missiles ,.,Russian forces greatly outnumber the Ukrainian Army, and might grind them down.,Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers last week there was a limit to how long Kyiv could hold on as Russian forces edged closer from the east, north and south, tightening the vise. “With supplies being cut off, it will become somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,” Berrier said.,Another senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments, said it could take up to two weeks for Russian forces to encircle Kyiv and then at least another month to seize it. That would require a combination of relentless bombardment and what could be weeks or months of door-to-door street fighting.,“It will come at a very high price in Russian blood,” said retired Adm. James Stavridis, former supreme allied commander for Europe. That high cost, he added, could cause Putin to destroy the city with an onslaught of missiles, artillery and bombs — “continuing a swath of war crimes unlike any we have seen in the 21st century.”,
,The Russian assault has failed to achieve any of Putin’s initial objectives. But on the battlefield, he is closer to some goals than others.,Beyond Kyiv, the northern cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy remain encircled, or nearly so, and continue to suffer heavy Russian shelling. Progress in the east and south, while slow, has been grindingly steady. But it also hints what a divided Ukraine might look like.,
,
,Russian forces are still subjecting Mariupol to siege and bombardment, but are close to securing that strategic southern port city and, with it, a land bridge from Crimea in the south to the Donbas region in the east that has been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.,And if Russia can seize Odesa, a pivotal Black Sea port city, and perhaps the remaining Ukrainian coast to the southeast, it would deprive Ukraine of important access to the sea.,Senior Pentagon officials said the key issue now is maintaining extreme pressure on Russia in hopes that Putin will cut his losses and settle for the Russian-speaking south and east.,Yet, the Russian attacks in western Ukraine over the past two days underscore Putin’s continued determination to control the entire country, starting with Kyiv. It remains unclear how he would find the forces to occupy it, which could require a bloody, yearslong guerrilla war.,“The most probable endgame, sadly, is a partition of Ukraine,” said Stavridis, pointing to the outcome of the Balkan wars in the 1990s as a model. “Putin would take the southeast of the country, and the ethnic Russians would gravitate there. The rest of the nation, overwhelmingly Ukrainian, would continue as a sovereign state.”,
,The fear now is that ,The more the fighting moves west, the more likely it is that an errant missile lands in NATO territory or the Russians take down a NATO aircraft.,Putin has used chemical weapons before against political opponents and defectors, and he might be inclined to do so again. Using battlefield nuclear weapons would cross a threshold, which most American officials believe even Putin would not do unless he believed he was facing the need to withdraw his troops. But the possibility of a nuclear detonation has been discussed more in the past two weeks than in years, officials say.,And finally, there are cyberattacks, which have been strangely missing from the conflict so far. They may be Putin’s most effective way of retaliating against the United States for grievous harm to the Russian economy.,So far, there are none of the procedures in place that American and Russian pilots use over Syria, for example, to prevent accidental conflict. And Putin has twice issued thinly veiled reminders of ,, reminding the world that if the conflict doesn’t go his way, he has far larger and far more fearsome weapons to call into play.,

			,AFP-JIJI,Afghan embassies around the world that have refused to recognize the new Taliban regime are struggling to stay afloat and facing increasing pressure from Kabul to accept loyalist replacements.,None of the country’s 60 or so ambassadors, consuls or heads of diplomatic missions who were appointed by Western-backed former president Ashraf Ghani have agreed to serve the hard-line Islamist group since it seized power in August last year.,
,The Taliban government has yet to be formally recognized by any nation, and the international community is grappling with how to deal with the country’s new rulers while also helping Afghans face an economic and humanitarian crisis.,“We are in a very unfortunate … situation, but we still have to continue to operate in these difficult circumstances,” said Youssof Ghafoorzai, the ambassador to Norway.,“The embassies still have a very important role to play in terms of trying to increase whatever humanitarian support is possible. But also (to help) discussions on the political track … to stabilize the situation.”,Aid and cash reserves, frozen by the United States and the international community after the Taliban seized control, are trickling back into the country, which has long depended almost entirely on donors.,But Ghafoorzai and his colleagues have had no contact with the new regime, and staff have not been paid for months.,The Afghan embassy and its consulates in the United States are being shut in the coming week.,“The Afghan Embassy and consulates are under severe financial pressure. Their bank accounts are not available to them,” a U.S. State Department official said.,
,
,The embassy and Washington have made arrangements for an “orderly shutdown of operations in a way that would protect and preserve all diplomatic mission property in the United States until operations are able to resume,” the official said.,Across the world, Afghan ambassadors have been forced to dramatically scale down their activities, reduce energy bills and food costs, and even move into smaller premises.,They have also increased consular fees to generate revenue.,“The embassy is not receiving any funding or financial assistance from Kabul,” said Farid Mamundzay, the ambassador in New Delhi.,“In the absence of the required financial support and depletion of resources, we have not been able to pay the staff salaries for months and had to downsize the strength and reduce the expenditure of the mission to the lowest.”,It is not clear how long visas, certificates and other documents issued by the holdout embassies will be recognized — either by the Taliban or the international community.,New passports issued in Kabul now refer to the country by the Taliban’s name, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, while officials have warned foreign journalists arriving with visas issued independently by the Dubai embassy that they may not be honored in future.,
,In a handful of countries near Afghanistan, some ambassadors have left their posts or been pushed out by the Taliban, who have inserted their own representatives — but even the replacements face hardship.,In Pakistan, salaries have not been paid since September. Employees live on income from visa and passport renewal fees and marriage certificates, said a source at the consulate in Peshawar, near the Afghan border.,The new consul general appointed by the Taliban receives just 50,000 rupees ($280) a month compared with the nearly $5,000 his predecessor made, the source added.,The Taliban made Pakistan, long accused of aiding their cause, the first country to which they sent a new representative.,
,
,In Beijing, the ambassador resigned when a senior diplomat loyal to the Taliban was appointed to the embassy, which he is now unofficially leading.,The Taliban have also managed to impose their men in Uzbekistan and Iran.,Russia, meanwhile, said it was ready to accept “two or three” new diplomats, but that they would not take the place of the current ambassador.,
,The Taliban did not respond to AFP’s requests for comment, but they have previously claimed to largely have control over Afghan embassies.,However, they have failed to have one of their top spokesmen, Suhail Shaheen, accredited as ambassador to the United Nations, with the General Assembly indefinitely postponing a vote on the matter.,In Rome, Italian police had to intervene after a scuffle between the Afghan ambassador and a recently dismissed pro-Taliban diplomat who claimed he had been given the top job.,“There have been threats, intimidation and violence in some of our missions by disgruntled ex-employees that are ideologically pro-Taliban,” said Khaled Zekriya, the ambassador in Rome.,“The Taliban administration tried to persuade our embassy to work on their behalf, but I said no.,“My answer will stay the same until an inclusive representative government will be established in Afghanistan, where the Taliban will be a part, not the only part, of this government.”,The Taliban have also sent delegations from Kabul to Oslo and Geneva, bypassing local embassies, for talks with Western powers.,Afghan diplomatic missions — in particular those in the West — united to openly criticize the Taliban for their failure to respect human rights ahead of the Oslo visit in January.,“It’s a difficult situation,” said Ghafoorzai, the ambassador to Norway.,“But we also know that we continue to represent a people that have suffered enormous difficulties throughout their history.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,A Taiwanese Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed into the sea off the island’s southeast coast on Monday after mechanical issues, but the pilot was rescued, the air force said. The incident marks the second combat aircraft loss in the space of three months.,The air force said the French-built aircraft took off just after 10 a.m. on a training mission from the Chihhang air base in Taitung, and reported it had to return after a mechanical problem.,
,The pilot ejected over the sea south of the air base and was rescued safe and in good condition by helicopter, it added.,An investigation team has been set up and sent to Taitung, the air force said.,Taiwan received its first Mirage jets in 1997, though they have been upgraded several times since then.,In January, the air force suspended combat training for its F-16 fleet after a recently upgraded model of the fighter jet crashed into the sea, killing the pilot.,Last year, two F-5E fighters, which first entered service in Taiwan in the 1970s, crashed into the sea after they apparently collided in mid-air during a training mission, also from the Chihhang air base.,In late 2020, an F-16 vanished shortly after taking off from the Hualien air base on Taiwan’s east coast on a routine training mission.,While Taiwan’s Air Force is well trained, it has been repeatedly scrambling to see off Chinese military aircraft intruding in its air defense zone in the past two years, though the accidents have not been linked in any way to these intercept activities.,China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has been routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense zone, mostly in an area around the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands but sometimes also into the airspace between Taiwan and the Philippines.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bloomberg,Europe saw some of the biggest growth in arms imports among world regions before Russia went to war with Ukraine, and the continent is expected to bolster defense capabilities in the coming decade, according to a report.,A study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute showed imports of major arms by European states between 2017 and 2021 rose 19% compared to the previous five years. European states accounted for 13% of global arms transfers in that time, up from 10% in the previous five-year period, the report said.,
,The largest arms buyers in Europe were the U.K., Norway and Netherlands, the report said. Imports for the region were set to accelerate with other European countries recently placing large orders for new weaponry, particularly combat aircraft from the U.S, according to the study.,“The severe deterioration in relations between most European states and Russia was an important driver of growth in European arms imports, especially for states that cannot meet all their requirements through their national arms industries,” said Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI arms transfers program.,Europe has strengthened its defense posture amid the growing prospect of conflict with Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24. The attack prompted Germany to plan a massive boost in defense in an historic policy shift, while Denmark and Sweden now have ambitions to meet the defense spending target that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has set for its members.,Ukraine, which has its own weapons manufacturing sector, was also buying arms from overseas during the five years to 2021. The Czech Republic was the main supplier of arms to Ukraine, accounting for 41% of imports followed by the U.S. at 31%.,
,The U.S.’s share of the international arms exports rose to 39% over the last five years while Russia and China have decreased to 19% and 4.6%, respectively. Among importing regions, Asia and Oceania remain the largest buyers for major arms, receiving 43% of global transfers since 2017.,“Tensions between China and many states in Asia and Oceania are the main driver of arms imports in the region,” said Siemon Wezeman, another researcher with SIPRI. “These tensions are also a major factor in U.S. arms transfers to the region.”,India was the world’s largest importer of weapons between 2017 and 2021. Five other countries, including Australia, China, South Korea, Pakistan and Japan, were among the top ten buyers of arms.,International transfers of major arms globally saw a 4.6% drop in 2017-2021 from the previous period. Arms imports from Russia to India dropped by 47% although it remained a major buyer of weapons from the country. India’s reliance on Russian weapons has been a key consideration in India declining to condemn Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Arms exports by the U.K. dropped by 41% in the five-year period from 2012 to 2016. Taiwan’s arms imports shrank by 68% during that period, but are set to increase significantly in the coming years.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,As thousands of would-be fighters from outside the country volunteer to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, some may also face legal consequences in their home countries.,Citizens of Canada, Georgia, India, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the volunteers, Reuters and other media organizations have reported.,
,Below is a summary of some of the laws governing foreigners who have signed up for Ukraine’s “international legion.”,
,U.S. citizens are not barred from serving in another country’s military, the State Department’s website says. Serving as an officer or fighting against a country that is at peace with the United States can be grounds for giving up citizenship voluntarily, but Supreme Court precedent says foreign military service alone cannot be used to strip Americans of citizenship.,A separate U.S. law dating back to 1794, the Neutrality Act, prohibits citizens from making war against foreign governments at peace with Washington and carries a prison sentence of up to three years. The law, which could technically apply to volunteer military action against Russia, was used to prosecute Americans involved in an attempted coup in Gambia in 2014. But otherwise it has been rarely enforced in modern history, according to David Malet, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C.,“Absent links to domestic terrorism, it’s hard for me to imagine Americans being prosecuted for going to Ukraine,” Malet said.,
,Britons traveling to Ukraine to fight could be subject to prosecution upon return, according to a , last updated Wednesday. Asked by Reuters what charges would apply to U.K. volunteers, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office declined to comment.,The United Kingdom’s Foreign Enlistment Act, last updated in 1870, blocks citizens from joining foreign militaries fighting countries at peace with Britain, but it has not been applied to modern conflicts. The U.K. Foreign Secretary initially voiced support for citizen volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but later warned against any travel there.,
,
,Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has urged his country’s citizens not to join the military fight in Ukraine, telling reporters last month that there are “uncertainties” about the legal position of foreign civilian combatants.,The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs did not respond to a request for comment about the legality of Indian citizens joining the Ukraine forces. In a case involving Indians traveling to Iraq in 2015, the ministry told the Delhi High Court that allowing Indians to participate in another country’s conflict “would lead to the allegation that the Indian government is promoting terrorism in other countries.”,
,Germany has said it will not prosecute volunteers who join the fighting, and Danish and Latvian leaders said they would allow their citizens to volunteer. Canadian defense minister Anita Anand has said whether Canadians volunteer is “an individual decision.”,
,International law requires Russian forces to treat foreign fighters as prisoners of war, regardless of their nationality, said Daphné Richemond-Barak, a professor with the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy in Israel. That means Russian soldiers must give volunteers who are captured food, water and medical treatment.,However, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman last week said Western “mercenaries” fighting for Ukraine would not be treated as lawful combatants and would face criminal prosecution or worse, according to Russian news agency TASS.,
,Because volunteers will be fighting as members of the Ukrainian army, they are unlikely to face charges in their home country over their specific actions in the war, with the exception of prosecution for war crimes or similar conduct, experts say.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,“The pandemic has created a very unusual sporting environment over the last two years with match and commercial delivery severely affected,” said SANZAAR chairman Marcelo Rodriguez.,“This has seen the member unions work very hard to keep rugby alive and present during COVID and at times this has not been easy.,“Indeed there has been much speculation about the future but it is now great that all members have committed through until the end of 2025 as a minimum.,“This means we can concentrate on ensuring The Rugby Championship remains as one of the best rugby tournaments on the world calendar.”,The impact of the pandemic meant the majority of the 2021 Rugby Championship was played in Australia, but SANZAAR remains confident the four nations will be able to host matches in the upcoming edition.,“Despite the lingering effects of the pandemic, it is planned that The Rugby Championship 2022 will be played in its entirety with a return to matches being played in all four countries,” the organization said in a statement.,“Due to the pandemic the match schedule over the last two years has been severely affected with no matches played in Argentina and only a handful of matches taking place in South Africa and New Zealand.,“The full 2022 match schedule will be announced in due course.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Unbeaten France heads to Murrayfield with an underdog mentality and a point to prove against Scotland on Saturday as it continues its bid for a Six Nations Grand Slam.,Fabien Galthie’s team is two-fifths of the way towards a first title and Grand Slam since 2010, after home wins against Italy (37-10) and Ireland (30-24).,
,Nevertheless, France is wary of a Scotland side that has beaten it in their last two Six Nations encounters and will be seeking its first hat trick of victories against France in the Six Nations in 64 years.,“We’re going there with an underdog mentality and with a point to prove,” said France’s English-born defense coach Shaun Edwards, who has played a key role in molding Les Bleus into a potentially world-beating force 18 months before a home World Cup.,“Scotland are the only side we haven’t beaten in the Six Nations since Fabien and I took over. They’ve got the better of us on the last two occasions,” he added.,Overcoming an outstanding Ireland side in Paris two weeks ago showed France has maintained the momentum of its stunning 40-25 success against New Zealand at the Stade de France in November.,France arrives in Edinburgh as the only unbeaten team left in the 2022 Six Nations and on a run of five straight victories in all competitions.,Scotland followed its stirring 20-17 home win against England with an abject performance in a 20-17 defeat by Wales in Cardiff.,Gregor Townsend’s side, however, dashed France’s Grand Slam hopes at Murrayfield in 2020, winning 28-17 after French prop Mohamed Haouas was sent off for punching Jamie Ritchie, and ended Les Bleus’ 2021 title challenge with a dramatic 27-23 win in Paris.,France did win an Autumn Nations Cup fixture 22-15 against a weakened Scotland team at an empty Murrayfield in November 2020 and has yet to lose three successive Championship matches in a row to the Scots in the Six Nations era.,The last time it happened dates back to the era of the Five Nations, in 1958.,“Scotland are a team that pose problems for us and we are aware of the level we will need to be at this time,” said Galthie, who has kept changes to a minimum.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Saitama Panasonic Wild Knights won a rematch of last season’s Top League championship, again ending Tokyo Suntory Sungoliath’s unbeaten season, this time in a 34-17 Japan Rugby League One victory on Saturday.,Wild Knights wing Marika Koroibete was named man of the match for his punishing runs that unhinged Sungoliath’s defense from start to finish, while Ben Gunter, who scored the hosts’ first try at Kumagaya Rugby Stadium, could have earned that honor as well.,
,Japan international Rikiya Matsuda opened the scoring in the third minute with the first of his five penalties on a day when he scored 19 with his boot.,“We knew this would be a tough game from the start,” Matsuda said. “We were able to move well from defense to attack. My teammates forced a lot of penalties, and I’m glad I could fulfill my responsibilities.”,Sungoliath fullback, All Black Damian McKenzie, kept the hosts on the back foot from the start with his boot and pace. He converted two early tries and added a penalty as Suntory seized a 17-3 lead less than 20 minutes into the game.,Indiscipline, however, short-circuited Sungoliath’s dangerous offense and neutralized the work of McKenzie and Wallaby Samu Kerevi, who was a constant threat.,Gunter scored Wild Knights’ first try, on a long throw from a lineout. Hooker Atsushi Sakate crossed in a maul after another lineout just before the half, which ended with some fireworks from both teams but no points with Panasonic leading 20-17.,Three Matsuda penalties made it 29-17 before Koroibete put a cork in this one with a thundering run before passing to Dylan Riley for a 72nd-minute try.,Wild Knights improved to 5-2, including two forfeits when coronavirus countermeasures prevented them from fielding a team in the new league’s first two weeks.,“Panasonic brought an excellent game,” Suntory captain Ryoto Nakamura said. “We were able to attack the way we want, but were unable to string together our good efforts over 80 minutes.”,Kubota Spears Funabashi Tokyo Bay, who have benefited from two coronavirus forfeits, moved into first place with 41-20 win over Toyota Verblitz. Sungoliath are two points back in second, with Verblitz third on 23 points and Wild Knights fourth on 22.,Elsewhere, Shizuoka Blue Revs beat NEC Green Rockets Tokatsu 34-27, while Kai Ishii’s late try lifted NTT Communications Shining Arcs Tokyo Bay Urayasu to a 22-11 win over Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo despite being down a man.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,France captain Antoine Dupont urged his side to guard against complacency after they moved within two matches of a first Six Nations title and Grand Slam since 2010 by sweeping aside bogey team Scotland with a thumping 36-17 victory at Murrayfield on Saturday.,“We’re very satisfied with this victory because it’s very difficult to win at Murrayfield, but we still have two matches to play and we have to remain cautious,” said Dupont, whose side ran in six tries to overwhelm a Scotland team who thwarted their title ambitions in 2020 and 2021.,
,Having already overcome Italy and Ireland at home, France will head to Wales on March 11, with the chance of clinching a title and Grand Slam against England in Paris eight days later.,“We haven’t won the tournament for twelve years and we have to aim for that,” added Dupont, who set up the opening try for giant lock Paul Willemse with a blistering break.,“But we have to make sure we are not complacent. We have to be rigorous.”,The French were rigorous and ruthless in their attacking from turnover ball as tries from Willemse, wingers Yoram Moefana and Damian Penaud, who bagged two, and centers Gael Fickou and Jonathan Danty earned their first Six Nations win in Edinburgh since 2014.,“The French are probably up there with the All Blacks in terms of getting tries from turnover ball,” said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend, whose players beat England in their opening game but now find themselves out of the title reckoning, having lost to Wales in Cardiff two weeks ago.,“Their front five add to that as well. It’s not just the backs. You’ve got a real XV who can attack.”,France are now on a six-match winning streak which includes their stunning 40-25 victory against New Zealand in Paris in November.,“In international rugby, what is important is to win matches,” said France head coach Fabien Galthie.,“We have to win and each victory is one more brick that we put on the wall that we’re trying to build.,“However, losses allow us to learn a lot and what we experienced here two years ago helped us a lot today.”,Asked about his team’s ruthless counterattacking, the former France captain and scrum-half said: “Rugby is a transition game. That is what we have worked on consistently — and also how to use our qualities, the intuition we have to allow the players to shift quickly from defense to attack.,“You can see in our training sessions we work on this transition game. You could see that today. There was quality in our decision making and great carrying of the ball.”,Scotland, hit by the loss of flanker Hamish Watson to COVID-19 on the eve of the match, will head to Rome to face Italy on March 12 before finishing their campaign against Ireland in Dublin.,“It’s a horrible feeling in the changing room,” said captain Stuart Hogg, whose side closed to within two points after a 28th minute try by flanker Rory Darge but tailed off long before winger Duhan van der Merwe’s 80th minute score.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Japan will play France for the first time since 2017 when they host Les Bleus in two matches in early July, the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU) said in a statement on Monday.,The series for the Lipovitan D Challenge Cup will begin at Toyota Stadium in Aichi Prefecture on July 2, with the teams meeting again on July 9 at an unnamed venue, the JRFU said.,
,“On behalf of the JRFU and the entire Japanese rugby family, I would like to express our sincere delight that the French national team will tour Japan this summer,” said JRFU President Shigetaka Mori.,“Les Bleus are playing remarkably well in the Six Nations Championship and continue to develop a potent style of play, combining power and speed with their traditional flair.,“With France due to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023, they are emerging as strong contenders for their home tournament.”,Japan reached the quarterfinals of the 2019 World Cup on home soil but did not play in 2020 because of the COVID-19 outbreak, returning to action after 18 months against the British & Irish Lions in June 2021.,The Brave Blossoms won only one of their six matches last year, against Portugal.,“As a result of the global pandemic, Japanese rugby fans have missed out on regular test match rugby being played in Japan,” Mori said.,“This series is therefore an important opportunity for us to reconnect with our fans, and I am certain the rugby family in Japan will be looking forward to reliving the enthusiasm and excitement that they experienced during Rugby World Cup 2019.”,France were held to a 23-23 draw at home by Japan the last time the teams met in November 2017.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Ireland captain Johnny Sexton said he hopes to go out on “a high, not a whimper” after he signed a contract extension through to the 2023 Rugby World Cup on Tuesday.,Sexton will be 38 by the time rugby’s quadrennial showpiece tournament kicks off in France and there had been speculation over whether he would carry on till then.,
,“I wanted to keep the dream going,” Sexton said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I do not want to go out on a whimper and hopefully I finish on a high at the World Cup.,“I am delighted to be able to say it has come to fruition (the contract) as I have been beating round the bush for six months.,“I want to make the most of my last 18 months of my career and to do that is to work hard and get my body in the best shape possible.”,Sexton is rightly regarded as a talisman both by his country and province Leinster and was crowned world player of the year in 2018.,He made his international debut against Fiji in November 2009 and has represented Ireland at three Rugby World Cups, in 2011, 2015 and 2019.,The latter tournament has proved a bugbear for both Ireland and Sexton as they have yet to reach the semifinals.,After being hammered by New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup, Sexton remarked that the manner of the defeat would be “raw for four years.”,“One of the biggest factors for me was talking to fellows who had retired after a World Cup and the disappointment they felt at not performing,” he said on Tuesday, of his decision to carry on till 2023.,“Age-wise a lot of players performed at the top of their game well into their thirties — take Richie McCaw and Brad Thorn, they won the World Cup trophy aged 34 and 36.”,Sexton is a two-time British and Irish Lions tourist, in 2013 and 2017, and has won three Six Nations titles with Ireland — including the 2018 Grand Slam — and five European Cups with Leinster.,IRFU Performance Director David Nucifora said Sexton had proved in his performances since the 2019 World Cup that he was still one of the world’s top players.,“Johnny’s performances continue to be of the highest standard and he remains an integral member of the Ireland and Leinster squads,” said Nucifora.,“He has always been a leader on the field and in the past two years since taking on the Ireland captaincy his leadership off it has been top class.”,Sexton’s first match in the final 18-month chapter of his career will be the daunting Six Nations clash with England at Twickenham on Saturday.,Both sides have lost a match apiece but are still in with a chance of winning the title, though France holds the whip hand with three wins from three matches.,England head coach Eddie Jones has labeled the Irish as favorites for the game.,“It is irrelevant,” said Sexton. “We have not won many times over there in the recent past.,“This game will be decided by who can put their best performance out there.,“We will prepare down to the finest detail such as the atmosphere that is going to hit us and their intensity.,“It will be a great test to see if we learned lessons from the French game (Ireland lost 30-24 in Paris) and if we can adapt in an away stadium.”,Sexton also cast an eye further ahead after the World Cup.,“I will be able to have a beer or a glass of wine a bit more often,” he said with a smile. “It has been an absolute dream to do what I have done and for so long as I have I pinch myself.,“When I hang up my boots I will be like a lost puppy but hopefully not for too long.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Nathan Chen won the U.S. Figure Skating Championships for the sixth consecutive year in dominating fashion on Sunday to solidify his status as the favorite to win gold at next month’s Beijing Olympics.,Chen, whose sole defeat since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games came last October in the first Grand Prix event of the Olympic figure skating season, was far from perfect in his free skate as he fell twice, but still did more than enough to separate himself from the pack.,
,The 22-year-old Chen was in first place after breaking his own national short program record on Saturday with a 115.39-point performance and returned to score 212.62 points in Sunday’s free skate.,Chen’s 328.01 total left him in a familiar spot atop the podium. Ilia Malinin (302.48) took second and Vincent Zhou (290.16) finished third.,“The competition was really tough today,” Chen said. “I’m glad to be a part of this generation and just looking forward to seeing where we can continue pushing U.S. figure skating.”,Chen fell early during his free skate and toward the end of the program laughed off a misstep that saw him faceplant on the ice during a choreographic sequence.,When it was all done Chen had completed six quadruple jumps between the two programs to extend his reign.,No American man has enjoyed such a dominant run at the national championships since two-time Olympic champion Dick Button won seven consecutive titles from 1946 to 1952.,Malinin, a 17-year-old competing in his first national championships, landed four quads during a clean free skate but it was not enough to secure a ticket to Beijing as he was passed over for a spot on the team by a selection committee.,The committee, which considers results dating back to the January 2021 U.S. Championships, instead chose Chen, Zhou and fourth-place finisher Jason Brown.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Russia’s Kamila Valieva, just 15 years old, hammered home her status as Olympic gold-medal favorite on Saturday when she swept to the European title in Tallinn.,Valieva — in her first season on the senior circuit — led a Russian sweep of the women’s podium, with her 259.06 points enough to defeat world champion Anna Shcherbakova (237.42 points) and Alexandra Trusova (234.36).,
,Russia also claimed titles in the men’s event, pairs and ice dance in a stunning performance less than three weeks before the Winter Olympics start in Beijing on Feb. 4.,“I am so happy, there are so many emotions that I can’t put them into words,” said Valieva who skated to “Bolero.”,“The medal means that I don’t just come to the practices for nothing and I guess the most important for me is not to burn out after this season, to calm down as much as possible and try to make the audience happy with my performances.,“I don’t know what will happen tomorrow, I live with today but am so happy with today being at the European Championships, it’s a childhood dream.”,In Thursday’s short program, Valieva had set a new world record of 90.45 points after a flawless performance to “In Memoriam.”,It bettered her previous world best mark of 87.42 points at the Russian Grand Prix in November.,Earlier on Saturday, Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov retained their ice dance title.,Sinitsina and Katsalapov won with a total of 217.96 points, ahead of compatriots Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin, who scored 213.20, and Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri on 207.97.,Their main rivals for Olympic gold, French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, the 2018 Olympic runners-up, opted to miss the event in Tallinn as a health precaution ahead of the Beijing Games.,“These European Championships will be in our hearts for a very long time,” said Sinitsina after dancing to Rakhmaninov’s “Piano Concerto No. 2.”,The winners obtained their best total of this Olympic winter.,But, with two scores above the 220 points in the Turin and Grenoble Grand Prix events in November, the French pair still hold an edge in their long-distance duel.,Sinitsina and Katsalapov won their first European title in 2020, narrowly edging the French pair, who had won the previous five titles.,The Russians also took the world title last March after the Montreal-based French duo opted to skip the event in Stockholm following a COVID-19-hit season.,It was a memorable tournament for Russia in the Estonian capital.,Teenager Mark Kondratiuk marked his European figure skating championship debut with the men’s title.,In the pairs, Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov claimed the European crown to add to their world championship triumph last year.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Japan’s Mai Mihara put her bitterness at missing out on a spot in the Winter Olympics behind her by winning gold for the second time in the ISU Four Continents Figure Skating Championships on Saturday, as the United States enjoyed a one-two in the pairs event.,Mihara’s fourth-placed finish at the Japanese national championships in December ended her hopes of competing at her first Winter Games in Beijing, but she held her nerve in Tallinn to reclaim a title she won five years ago.,
,In the pairs, Audrey Lu and Misha Mitrofanov survived a fall in the free skate to win gold by an 8.16-point margin over fellow Americans Emily Chan and Spencer Akira Howe in the Estonian capital.,Mihara, 22, led all the way, scoring a career-high 218.03 points and bettering South Korean skaters Lee Hae-in (213.52) and Kim Ye-lim (209.91), who claimed their first ISU medals with silver and bronze respectively.,“I was so nervous today as the nationals were in the back of my mind, like a flashback,” said Mihara.,“I was crying even before I went on the ice, but I was able to overcome that bitterness from nationals and bring home a gold medal to Japan.”,Mihara extended her lead from the short program, despite a glitch on her final spin in her free skate to “Fairy of the Forest” and “Galaxy” by Yuko Toyoda, scoring a career-best 145.41.,It was her fourth medal in the competition following her gold in 2017, with silver and bronze in 2018 and 2019 respectively.,“The order was 1, 2, 3 so I didn’t want to end up with fourth placement this time,” she said.,“This gold has a totally different meaning than 2017.,“This time I put pressure on myself. I needed to go on the top of the podium and get the gold. I was overwhelmed with joy on seeing the results, with tears rolling.”,Lee and Kim bettered South Korean national champion You Young who finished sixth after an error-strewn free skate including a fall on her triple toeloop.,Sixteen-year-old Lee skated to “Homage to Korea” by Ji Pyeong Kwon for her first participation in the competition, landing seven clean triple jumps, for a career best 143.55, and improving her previous personal best by 10 points.,Kim, 19, held third place despite finishing fourth in the free dance to Puccini’s Turandot, as she prepares for the Olympics after finishing second at nationals.,“This competition has given me confidence,” she said.,“It was very close to nationals and I was worried about my condition. I had a clean program today so this gives me confidence.”,In pairs, despite Lu falling in their free skate to Ronan Hardiman’s “Ancient Lands”, the Americans held their lead from the short program, scoring 189.10 points overall, with Chan and Akira Howe scoring 180.94.,Canada’s Evelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud scored 179.70 points to take bronze.,The American and Canadian skaters are not competing in the Beijing Olympics.,Most of the top skaters from Asia and North America have opted to skip the competition, which takes place just two weeks before the Winter Games, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.,China did not send a team to Estonia.,The competition concludes on Sunday with South Korean champion Cha Jun-hwan leading Japanese duo Kazuki Tomono and Kao Miura in the men’s event going into the free skate.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,A rivalry that fizzled out in Pyeongchang four years ago may produce fireworks at the Beijing Games when two-time defending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu battles American Nathan Chen in his quest for more figure skating glory.,The Japanese “Ice Prince” will be trying to match Gillis Grafstrom’s 94-year record of three consecutive Olympic golds in the men’s singles event, four years after joining U.S. icon Dick Button as a back-to-back winner.,
,Widely regarded the finest skater of the modern era, Hanyu could stake his claim as the greatest of all time if he can withstand the threat of quad-jumping virtuoso Chen.,Many expected their rivalry to light up the 2018 Games, but Chen, then a teenager, stumbled through a calamitous short program in his Olympic debut.,Now 22, Chen has bounced back magnificently through the Olympic cycle, claiming three world titles in succession to again loom as Hanyu’s chief threat at Beijing’s Capital Indoor Stadium.,It would be risky to bet against Hanyu, however, given his experience and track record of performing on the biggest stage.,“When it is an Olympic Games, Yuzuru always shows up,” former U.S. champion Adam Rippon said.,“He always steps into the light of that moment.”,There will be no chance of a repeat winner in the women’s singles, however, with Pyeongchang champion Alina Zagitova overshadowed by the brilliant Russian teens who have since taken over the sport.,Though barely heard of outside of Russia a few months ago, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva is the latest quad-jumping sensation from the stable of master coach Eteri Tutberidze.,She lead a Russian sweep of the women’s singles podium spots at the European championships and could easily do the same in Beijing.,Russian skaters have strength across the board, making them a major contender for the team title, but home fans will be hopeful Sui Wenjing and Han Cong can deny them gold in the pairs event.,Sui and Han, who hold the world record for total points in competition and took silver in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were runners-up to Russians Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov at the 2021 world championships but felt they were only at 70-80% of their best after rushed preparations.,With iconic Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir retired after their second ice dance gold at Pyeongchang, Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron will hope their time has come in Beijing — and that their costumes stay intact.,Papadakis suffered a heartbreaking wardrobe malfunction in the short program four year ago, but the four-time world champions won hearts with their brave recovery to win silver.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji, staff report,Figure skating star Yuzuru Hanyu will miss this month’s world championships because an ankle sprain he suffered at the Beijing Olympics has not fully healed, the Japan Skating Federation said Tuesday.,The two-time Olympic gold medalist fell twice during his free skate at the 2022 Winter Games in the Chinese capital, where he finished fourth in the men’s individual competition.,
,He had been due to compete at the ISU World Figure Skating Championships in Montpellier, France, from March 21-27, but Kao Miura will be sent in his place, the JSF said in a statement.,The organization said Hanyu could not skate at the event because “the sprain of his right ankle joint, injured at the Beijing Olympics, hasn’t healed.”,Hanyu, 27, had been chasing a third consecutive gold at the Games in February and went for broke with a long program that included an attempt at a quadruple axel — something no skater has ever landed in competition.,But the Japanese “Ice Prince” tumbled twice, once while trying to nail the notoriously difficult jump.,Hanyu later admitted that he needed an injection of painkillers in order to lace up for his free skate.,“The pain was so strong during my morning practice that I wasn’t sure what I should do, but about 10 minutes before our six-minute warmup I received a painkiller shot and I was able to compete,” he said at a Feb. 14 news conference.,Despite the two falls, Hanyu’s free program was third-best among the 24 finalists — an improvement on his short program, which ranked eighth after his planned quad salchow was stymied by what he said was a hole in the ice.,“Honestly, it feels like everything has gone wrong this time around, but I did my best,” he told reporters after the competition, in which U.S. star Nathan Chen won gold.,Silver and bronze were taken by Japanese skaters Yuma Kagiyama and Shoma Uno.,Hanyu’s right ankle ligaments have given him trouble for years. He hurt the same ankle just months before the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, returning to the ice shortly before that event.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,James Harden said Tuesday that he’s excited to play for the Philadelphia 76ers, who represent his third team in a 14-month span.,During that stretch, Harden ventured from the Houston Rockets to the Brooklyn Nets before the latter traded him to the Sixers on Thursday. The 32-year-old guard joined veteran forward Paul Millsap in being acquired by Philadelphia for guards Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, center Andre Drummond and a pair of first-round picks.,
,“It wasn’t planned like this,” Harden said during his introductory news conference on Tuesday. “Fourteen months ago, I didn’t see myself with three different teams, but we are where we are here today and I’m happy. Last year has been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of stress, but whatever, that’s in the past. I’m excited, I’m healthy, and it’s an opportunity of a lifetime.”,That opportunity includes playing with star center Joel Embiid, who is averaging an NBA-best 29.5 points per game entering play on Tuesday.,“I think we complement each other,” Harden said of Embiid. “Obviously, the whole world knows how great Joel’s been playing. Not just scoring the basketball, rebounding, he got a triple-double last game, his presence alone is unbelievable. I feel like I’m the same way as far as making my teammates better and doing different things to impact the game at the highest level.”,When asked if he could elevate the 76ers to a championship this season, Harden didn’t even wait for the question to be completed.,“Hell, yeah!” he said.,Harden has been nursing a strained left hamstring and hasn’t played since Feb. 2. The 76ers said he will continue his treatment and an update on his status will be given after the All-Star break.,On the season, Harden has played in 44 games, averaging 22.5 points, 10.2 assists and eight rebounds per game.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI, REUTERS,Somebody forgot to tell Stephen Curry that the three-point contest was Saturday.,The Golden State Warriors superstar put on a shooting clinic to lead Team LeBron to victory in the 2022 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.,
,LeBron James sank the game-winning basket as his side edged Team Durant 163-160, giving James his fifth straight all-star win as team captain.,But Curry was the brightest shooting star, winning the MVP award with a 50-point performance that included a record 16 3-pointers in front of a crowd of 19,400 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland.,He finished just two shy of Anthony Davis' 2017 single-game scoring record of 52 points, but shattered Paul George's previous record of nine threes, set in 2016.,""I tried, I tried,"" Curry said of flirting with the single-game scoring record.,""When I get going the energy picks up. It is pretty special being back in Ohio.,""Obviously this trophy has very special meaning. I am very humbled, very blessed and I appreciate it."",Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers had 36 points and 10 rebounds to lead Team Durant.,The All-Star Game was preceded by the three-point shooting contest on Saturday, a competition Curry won in 2021 in Chicago. Karl-Anthony Towns was this year's winner, as Curry did not enter.,James, a native of Ohio, nailed the winning shot with a fadeaway jumper to elevate Team LeBron to the target score of 163.,The 37-year-old was playing in his 18th All-Star game, which ties him with the late Kobe Bryant and moves him one shy of the record held by Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.,James was one of two captains, the other being Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, who did not attend the game due to the death of his grandmother earlier in the day.,Monty Williams of the Phoenix Suns coached Team LeBron while Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat coached Team Durant.,Ja Morant, the Memphis Grizzlies' rising star scored six points and was one of seven players making their All-Star debut.,The other first-timers were the Charlotte Hornets' LaMelo Ball, the Cleveland Cavaliers duo of Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland, the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins, the San Antonio Spurs' Dejounte Murray and the Toronto Raptors' Fred VanVleet.,The NBA honored its 75th Anniversary Team during halftime, with players from every decade of the league's existence in attendance for the diamond anniversary.,Curry caught fire when play resumed, knocking down five 3-pointers in just over two minutes. His second 3-pointer during the stretch was his 10th, which broke George's record.,Commissioner Adam Silver addressed the media as part of the All-Star festivities, telling reporters there is no ""silver bullet"" to fix the problem of NBA stars dictating where they want to play by demanding trades to playoff contenders.,Silver was asked if the league was investigating last week's swap between the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, which saw James Harden join his third team in two seasons.,""There are no silver bullets here,"" Silver said. ""There isn't any one aspect of the package where we can say, 'This will fix the problem.'"",In the aftermath of the blockbuster trade, some of Harden's peers called him out on social media, alleging the former league MVP wasn't injured and was simply trying to get out of Brooklyn. Others wondered if the Sixers tampered to convince Harden to force a trade from the Nets.,""He wasn't hurt,"" former NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady said. ""He shut it down. Y'all think he's hurt right now?… You don't rehab a hammy by doing stepbacks."",""We all know Philly was his first choice before he went to Brooklyn. So, when things hit the fan, he wanted out of there."",Silver was also asked about Ben Simmons, who in August 2021 demanded a trade out of Philadelphia and then stopped cooperating with the club.,Instead of trading him right away, the 76ers fined and suspended him, forcing him to miss dozens of games.,Simmons was finally dealt along with Andre Drummond, Seth Curry and two future first-round picks, to Brooklyn in exchange for Harden and Paul Millsap.,""I have expressed my unhappiness before with public trade demands,"" Silver said.,""We want players and teams to honor their contracts. In this case, we had two teams satisfied by the outcome of the trade."",In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Kyrie Irving could soon be available for home games in Brooklyn.,New York City mayor Eric Adams said he’s eager to end the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which would clear the way for the Nets to use their All-Star point guard in games at the Barclays Center. Irving has played in road games with the Nets but refused the COVID vaccine required for players in the New York home market.,
,Major cities are repealing mask and vaccine mandates with Philadelphia, Boston and soon Chicago among them.,“I take my hat off to New Yorkers through masks, vaccines, through social distancing. We were hit with the uncertainty, the fear of COVID. I’m very proud of how we responded,” Adams said Wednesday without providing a timeline or estimate of when the rules could change in New York.,“Every morning I meet with my health professionals because I always say I’m going to follow the science. I’m not going to get ahead of the science because I’m ready to get ahead of all of this and get back to a level of normalcy. But they’re giving us clear instructions. They gave us benchmarks, we’re going to follow those benchmarks. But I look forward to the next weeks going through a real transformation where I don’t have to wonder what you look like. We’re moving in the right direction. We’re going to do it in a safe way.”,Irving was approved to return and play in road games by the Nets on December 17. In 14 games this season, he’s averaging 24.1 points and 5.4 assists per game.,The Nets have 23 games remaining on their regular-season schedule, but 15 of them would be played without Irving due to the vaccine mandate.,Irving has recently received support from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and some league owners who criticized the mandate applying to players from the New York market but not to players visiting New York from other cities.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,It wasn’t clear exactly how long Griner had been in custody, with the customs service saying only that the arrest occurred “in February.”,According to the statement, an inspection of hand luggage carried by a U.S. citizen who arrived on a flight from New York “confirmed the presence of ‘vapes’ (and) a liquid with a specific smell.”,It said an expert had determined that the liquid was the narcotic cannabis oil (hashish oil) and said the charges carry a potential jail term of five-to-10 years.,The statement did not identify the jailed woman but said she was a two-time Olympic basketball champion for the United States and a player in the WNBA.,The customs service also released a video on Saturday in which airport security services are seen going through the luggage of a passenger who appears to be Griner.,USA Basketball, which oversees the Olympic teams, said on Twitter that it was “aware of and closely monitoring the legal situation facing Brittney Griner in Russia.”,It added: “Brittney has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball and her safety and well-being are our primary concerns.”,Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas of Wasserman Group, said in a statement issued to US media that the agency was in contact with Griner.,“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA,” she said.,“As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern.”,Griner, 31, led the Phoenix Mercury to the franchise’s third WNBA title in 2014 and a surprise return to the WNBA finals in October.,The 206-cm center has played for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason since 2015, helping the club to three Russian domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021.,Griner is among a majority of the 144 players on WNBA rosters who have played overseas in the North American league’s offseason.,Earnings at European clubs can far outstrip what players make in the United States. Griner has reportedly made as much as $1 million a year with UMMC, while the WNBA maximum is about $228,000.,A WNBA spokeswoman told the New York Times on Saturday that all WNBA players apart from Griner had left Russia and Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion of the neighboring country.,The Mercury, the WNBA and the WNBA Players Association all issued statements supporting Griner, the WNBA saying she had the league’s full support and our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States.”,The Mercury added: “We love and support Brittney, and at this time our main concern is her safety, physical and mental health, and her safe return home.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura talked up Japan’s national women’s team guard Rui Machida on Saturday ahead of her arrival in the U.S. capital to play for the WNBA’s Washington Mystics.,A key member of the women’s silver medal-winning Tokyo Olympic team last summer, Machida is set to join the Mystics, the sister club of the Wizards, before the WNBA season starts in May.,
,Hachimura, who starred for the Japanese men’s Olympic team, predicted Machida would fit well in Washington.,“She’s a good player (and) I think she chose a good team,” Hachimura said in an online interview.,While Machida’s signing was announced in mid-February, Hachimura said he had learned about the deal roughly a month ago while speaking with a member of the Mystics coaching staff.,“I said (Machida) really stood out at the Olympics. I also mentioned that I wasn’t too bad either,” Hachimura laughed.,Having made a late start to his third NBA campaign after taking time off for personal reasons, the 24-year-old Hachimura has hit the second half of the season in strong shape.,He has given Wizards head coach Wes Unseld Jr. reliable scoring off the bench, hitting double digits in the last three games, including 19 in Friday’s 117-114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks.,“Coach has shown faith in me, so I want to repay that by playing to his expectations,” Hachimura said.,At 28-34, the Wizards are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference and once again battling for a place in the playoff play-in games involving the teams ranked seventh to 10th.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Diplomats were working to ensure the release of seven-time WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner after Russia said it detained the player last month for possession of vape cartridges containing hash oil, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.,The Russian Customs Service, without naming Griner, said on Saturday that it had detained an athlete in February after the player arrived at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York.,
,Russian news agency TASS identified the player as Griner, citing a source. Griner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, said: “We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia.”,A scan of the player’s luggage revealed cartridges containing “liquid with hashish oil,” and a criminal case has been opened carrying a possible sentence of five to 10 years in prison, the customs service said.,It was not clear when in February Griner, who plays in Russia during the WNBA offseason, was detained. The player is still in custody and an investigation is underway, the Russian Customs Service said.,Griner, who won Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national team in 2016 and 2021, “has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball,” USA Basketball said on Twitter.,At a joint press conference with Moldova President Maia Sandu on Sunday, Blinken said the Biden administration had assigned an embassy team to work on Griner’s case.,“There’s only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point,” Blinken said of Griner. “Whenever an American is detained anywhere in the world, we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance, and that includes in Russia.”,He added, “We have an embassy team that’s working on the cases of other Americans who are detained in Russia. We’re doing everything we can to see to it that their rights are upheld and respected.”,Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and Western nations’ sweeping sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow, the United States on Saturday warned against travel to Russia and said its embassy there had limited ability to assist citizens.,LGBTQ rights advocates expressed particular concern for Griner in light of the fact that she is an openly gay woman being detained in a country that has a record of restricting LGBTQ rights.,“Our thoughts are with Brittney Griner, her loved ones, and her teammates during this terrifying ordeal,” a spokesperson for Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ rights in sports, said on Sunday. “Brittney has long been a powerful voice for LGBTQ+ equality. It’s critical that now we use our collective voice to call for her safe and swift return to her family.”,Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, posted on Instagram on Saturday that she appreciated the prayers and support she had received following Brittney’s detention. “This message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life,” she wrote. “Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Major League Baseball has cancelled more preseason games, a sign that the start of the regular season could be further delayed as contract negotiations with players drag on.,Opening Day of the regular season, originally scheduled for March 31, has already been pushed back.,
,MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday that failure of the two sides to reach agreement on a series of economic issues left the league with no choice but to cancel the first two series of regular-season games.,The cancellation of preseason games at least through March 17 could have a knock-on effect leading to more regular-season cancellations.,Manfred has said that a four-week exhibition season is needed to guard against player injuries.,Some players, however, have indicated that a three-week preseason would be sufficient to prepare.,Spring Training was shortened to three weeks before the lockout-impacted 1990 season, strike-delayed 1995 season and pandemic-shortened 2020 season.,Players and owners departed Jupiter, Florida, on Tuesday after nine days of talks that failed to end the stalemate.,Owners had locked out players on Dec. 2 after the expiration of the previous collective bargaining agreement, saying the action would increase the sense of urgency in negotiations.,However, the players’ union chief negotiator Bruce Meyer said Tuesday there remained “major issues on which we were very far apart.”,That includes the competitive balance tax — which is MLB’s de facto salary cap, and salary levels for young players who are not yet eligible for salary arbitration.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Major League Baseball described negotiations with its locked-out players as “deadlocked” after a meeting on Sunday during which it said the union presented a proposal that “backtracked” on some issues.,The two sides met in New York for the first time since Tuesday, when MLB decided to cancel the first week of regular season games after a league-imposed deadline passed without an deal on a new collective bargaining agreement.,
,But MLB, which said it was hoping see some movement in its direction in order to gain additional flexibility to get a deal done quickly, walked away from the meeting unimpressed.,“The Players Association chose to come back to us with a proposal that was worse than Monday night and was not designed to move the process forward,” said MLB spokesman Glen Caplin.,“On some issues, they even went backwards. Simply put, we are deadlocked. We will try to figure out how to respond but nothing in this proposal makes it easy.”,The MLB Players Association did not immediately respond when asked for a comment on the latest talks, but according to reports one official denies the league’s assertion that the union moved backwards.,The two sides reportedly remain far apart on issues like luxury tax, minimum salaries and the pre-arbitration bonus pool, raising the possibility that more games could soon be canceled.,The 2022 season was scheduled to begin on March 31 and this year could mark the first games missed due to a labor dispute since the players’ strike of 1994-95.,That work stoppage forced a premature end to one season, delayed the start of the next year’s campaign and turned off fans, with attendances plummeting when play finally resumed.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Max Muncy said he expects to be fully recovered from an elbow injury and in the starting lineup on opening day — whenever that is and at whatever position.,Muncy sustained a left elbow injury in a collision at first base with Milwaukee’s Jace Peterson on Oct. 3, the final day of the regular season, and missed the entire postseason. Although the team didn’t initially confirm the severity of the injury, Muncy said in November that it was a torn ulnar collateral ligament that didn’t require Tommy John surgery.,
,In a recent guest appearance on AM 570 LA Sports radio in Los Angeles, Muncy said he was on track to play on opening day on March 31. The start of the season has been delayed because of the ongoing MLB lockout.,“I think even before the lockout it was looking like I’d be ready for opening day,” said Muncy, a two-time All-Star. “I still think we’re on track for that now. It’s feeling strong and healthy. It’s a little stiff, but that’s to be expected. We’re working through it and it should be good to go.”,Muncy, 31, had emerged as the Dodgers’ first baseman over the past few seasons, but he can also can play at second and third. With the departure of shortstop Corey Seager to the Texas Rangers in free agency, the Dodgers will need to shuffle their infield, moving Trea Turner from second base to shortstop. Muncy said he wouldn’t mind a move to second base.,Especially if that means the Dodgers sign Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman, a free agent who is at the top of a lot of teams’ wishlist.,Freeman, a Southern California native, won the National League MVP award in 2020 and the World Series with the Braves in 2021. A five-time All-Star, he’s a career .295 hitter with 271 home runs and 941 RBIs in 11-plus seasons in Atlanta.,Muncy said he’s always most enjoyed second base and would be happy to slide over to make way for Freeman.,“Imagine how dangerous we’d be if we get him in that lineup. It makes me really excited,” he said.,Muncy hit .249 last season and led the Dodgers with 36 home runs and 94 RBIs.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,“We worked hard to reach an agreement and offered a fair deal with significant improvements for the players and our fans,” Manfred said.,“I am saddened by this situation’s continued impact on our game and all those who are a part of it, especially our loyal fans.”,The 2022 season had been due to get under way on March 31 but has been pushed back after fruitless negotiations to end a lockout of players.,The sides met for 16 hours on Tuesday, with the talks wrapping up in the early hours of Wednesday morning.,A similarly protracted round of late-night negotiations also ended without an agreement last week, prompting MLB chiefs to cancel the opening weekend of games — marking the first time in 27 years regular season games have been lost to due to a labor dispute.,Players and team owners have been wrangling over the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement since February.,Players have been locked out by club owners since the previous labor deal expired on Dec. 1, 2021.,In his statement on Wednesday, Manfred said teams had gone to “extraordinary lengths” to meet the demands of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), baseball’s players union.,“In a last-ditch effort to preserve a 162-game season, this week we have made good-faith proposals that address the specific concerns voiced by the MLBPA and would have allowed the players to return to the field immediately,” Manfred said.,“The clubs went to extraordinary lengths to meet the substantial demands of the MLBPA. On the key economic issues that have posed stumbling blocks, the clubs proposed ways to bridge gaps to preserve a full schedule.,“Regrettably, after our second late-night bargaining session in a week, we remain without a deal.,“Because of the logistical realities of the calendar, another two series are being removed from the schedule, meaning that Opening Day is postponed until April 14th.,“We have the utmost respect for our players and hope they will ultimately choose to accept the fair agreement they have been offered.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Major League Baseball and its locked-out players reached an agreement on Thursday on a labor deal that ends the second-longest work stoppage in the game’s history.,MLB had initiated a player lockout in December, with months of either silence or flurries of activity on the labor negotiation front following since. At one point, the league set a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 28 to come to an agreement, past which they would have to cancel the first two weeks of games for the 2022 season — originally scheduled to begin on March 31. That deadline came and went, along with the announcement of game cancellations.,
,For the time being the bitter negotiations are now a thing of the past following Thursday’s agreement, but the process has left a bad taste in the mouths of many fans, and likely the players as well.,“I am genuinely thrilled to be able to say that Major League Baseball is back and we’re going to play 162 games,” said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, opening a press conference with an apology to fans.,“I know that the last few months have been difficult. There (was) a lot of uncertainty at a point in time when there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world,” he said.,Team owners voted to ratify the agreement just hours after the players approved the new five-year labor pact.,According to a report on MLB’s website, the pact is expected to include increased minimum salaries, a new pre-arbitration bonus pool to reward top young players and a raising of the competitive balance tax threshold.,Spring training camps will open on Sunday and a full 162-game regular season is to begin on April 7. Double-headers have been added to the schedule to make up games that would have been played from a March 31 Opening Day.,“Our union endured the second-longest work stoppage in its history to achieve significant progress in key areas that will improve not just current players’ rights and benefits, but those of generations to come,” MLB Players Association (MLBPA) Executive Director Tony Clark said in a statement.,“Players remained engaged and unified from beginning to end, and in the process re-energized our fraternity,” Clark said,The final vote from the executive sub-committee and 30 players representative was 26-12 in favor of the new collective bargaining agreement, ESPN reported.,
,While the deal paves the way for the return of America’s pastime, bitter acrimony remains between the two sides.,Clark last week called the lockout the “ultimate economic weapon” against the athletes.,Manfred defended the move on Thursday, calling it “the most effective way” to reach a new agreement without losing games when a deal was not in place at the expiration of the previous pact. But he acknowledged there was work to be done to repair the league’s relationship with its on-field talent.,“One of the things I’m supposed to do is promote a good relationship with our players. I’ve tried to do that. I think that I have not been successful in that,” he said.,He said the league compromised on its proposed 14-team playoffs and made other concessions to MLB players.,“I do believe — I hope — that the players will see the effort we made to address their concerns in this agreement as an olive branch,” said Manfred.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,The Toronto Blue Jays and free agent left-hander Yusei Kikuchi reached an agreement on a three-year, $36 million deal, according to multiple reports.,MLB.com said Saturday a source confirmed the Blue Jays made the first major post-lockout move by signing the 30-year-old, although it has not yet been announced by the club.,
,Kikuchi will reportedly earn $16 million in 2022 and $10 million in each of the 2023 and 2024 seasons.,The former Seibu Lions star reportedly turned down a $13 million player option to return to Seattle.,Kikuchi went 7-9 with a 4.41 ERA in 157 innings over 29 starts in a 2021 season in which he was selected to the All-Star Game but faded down the stretch. Over his three seasons in the MLB, Kikuchi is 15-24 with a 4.97 ERA in 70 starts.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Cricket superstar Shane Warne died of natural causes, Thai police said Monday, as his family lamented a “tragedy we will never come to terms with.”,The legendary Australian leg-spinner died on the Thai holiday island of Koh Samui on Friday after being found unresponsive at a luxury villa.,
,Initial reports suggested the 52-year-old suffered a heart attack and autopsy results on Monday confirmed he died of natural causes.,“Investigators received an autopsy report today in which a forensic doctor concludes the death was due to natural causes,” Krissana Pattanacharoen, deputy national police spokesman, said in a statement.,He said Warne’s family had been informed of the result and accepted it.,“Investigators will conclude the autopsy reports and send them to state prosecutor as soon as possible,” Krissana added.,Surachate Hakparn, assistant to the national police chief, said investigators had found no signs of violence at the villa where Warne was found.,“His father said he (Warne) had been suffering chest pains and was planning to return home for a check-up after this trip,” Surachate told reporters in Koh Samui.,Warne’s unexpected death sparked an outpouring of grief from prime ministers, rock stars and fellow athletes.,The player — one of the greatest test cricketers of all time — was found after failing to meet friends.,He was taken to the Thai International Hospital Samui but despite medical efforts he could not be revived.,Officials said his body will now be transported to Bangkok to be handed over to diplomats for repatriation to Australia, where he is to be honoured with a state funeral.,In their first public comments since the death on Friday, Warne’s parents, brother, children and ex-wife expressed deep sorrow, paying tribute to one of the greatest Test cricketers of all time and the man they loved.,“To find words to adequately express our sadness is an impossible task for us and looking to a future without Shane is inconceivable,” parents Keith and Brigitte Warne said in a statement.,“I miss you so much already,” said daughter Summer Warne. “I wish I could’ve hugged you tighter in what I didn’t know were my final moments with you.”,“I wish I could’ve told you that everything was going to be OK and hold your hand.”,Son Jackson Warne reminisced about playing golf and poker, and watching Australian rules football while eating pizza with someone he saw as a brother and best friend, as well as a father.,“I love you so much. I don’t think anything is ever going to fill the void you have left in my heart,” he said in a statement.,“You were truly the best father and mate anyone could’ve asked for. I love you so much Dad, see you soon.”,Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison led tributes to one of the country’s “greatest characters” and announced Warne would receive a full state funeral.,Over the weekend fans paid homage to Warne at the Melbourne Cricket Ground — including offerings of cigarettes, beer and meat pies — to remember an extraordinary cricketing talent with a huge appetite for life.,Credited with reviving the art of leg-spin, Warne was part of a dominant Australian Test team in the 1990s and 2000s and helped his country win the 1999 limited-overs World Cup.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,The fourth season of “Drive to Survive,” the Netflix docu-series that has turbocharged Formula One for new and younger audiences, debuts on Friday with the sport still committed to the “marriage” despite controversy and criticism.,The 10 new episodes offer behind the scenes insight into the 2021 season, one of grand prix racing’s most exciting and closely-fought championships.,
,“I think it’s a great partnership,” Greg Maffei, CEO of Formula One’s U.S.-based owners Liberty Media, told analysts in a recent conference call.,“It’s been a win all the way around. Clearly grown our sport, not only in the U.S. but around the world. It is a great thing for Netflix as well. So I hope the marriage continues for a long time.”,Cumulative television viewership in the United States was up 58% year-on-year in 2021, according to F1 figures, with 400,000 fans making the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, the best-attended race of last season.,A second U.S. race, in Miami, will debut in May and U.S.-based sponsors, such as Red Bull’s new title partner Oracle, are increasingly prominent.,The Netflix partnership has had its critics, however, with last year’s final showdown in Abu Dhabi triggering accusations that the sport’s integrity had been sacrificed for entertainment.,Race director Michael Masi, since replaced, changed the safety car procedures in a late move that allowed Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to win and deny Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton a record eighth title.,McLaren’s Lando Norris said afterwards he felt it was done “for the TV.”,Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, playing a starring role in a series snubbed by Verstappen who said last year he felt some of the driver rivalries were “faked,” felt the criticism was unfair.,“F1 is still a sport, but sport is an entertainment,” he told the BBC.,“And one could also argue that there have been more people talking about Formula One in the past two and a half months when, traditionally, it would have been in hibernation.”,Much of that talk has also been about what might ultimately be revealed by the Netflix cameras.,Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali recognized, however, that “Drive to Survive” needed to remain a “differentiating factor” with other sports jumping on the bandwagon in a bid to boost audiences.,Amazon Prime will launch a similar MotoGP Unlimited docu-series on March 14 while the Netflix producers have teamed up with tennis’s Grand Slam tournaments and ATP and WTA tours and are also reportedly in discussions with cycling’s Tour de France.,“If it’s becoming just a different way to speak about Formula One without … giving to the F1 platform any added value maybe I think it’s better to renegotiate and see with Netflix or with the other partners what could be a possibility to do something different in the future,” Domenicali said.,“But for sure this platform has been a vital point on the growth of awareness, mainly with the young generation and newcomers.”,The 2022 Formula One season starts in Bahrain on March 20.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Ministers from 37 nations signed a joint statement on Tuesday calling for additional sporting sanctions to be imposed on Russia and Belarus following the invasion of Ukraine.,The statement, organized by the British government, followed a virtual summit convened by Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston on March 3.,
,France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada and the United States are among the other signatories.,“Russia’s unprovoked and unjustifiable war of choice against Ukraine, enabled by the Belarusian government, is abhorrent and a flagrant breach of its international obligations,” the statement said.,“Respect for human rights and peaceful relations between nations form the foundation of international sport.”,The statement also called for Russia and Belarus not to be permitted to “host, bid for or be awarded any international sporting events.”,And it said any ban should also be extended to individual athletes selected by Russia and Belarus administrators, as well as teams or cities “effectively representing” the states such as major soccer clubs.,Welcoming the recent decision by the International Paralympic Committee to ban both Russia and Belarus athletes from the Winter Paralympics in Beijing, the statement said: “These restrictions should be in place until cooperation under the fundamental principles of international law has become possible again.”,Earlier on Tuesday, sport’s top court said the Football Union of Russia had lodged appeals against the suspension of Russian national teams and clubs from all FIFA and UEFA competitions over the invasion of Ukraine.,The FUR is asking the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a stay of execution for the suspensions, in order to allow Russia to play in a 2022 World Cup playoff against Poland scheduled for March 24.,CAS said it had initiated two separate arbitration procedures involving soccer’s global governing body FIFA and European counterpart UEFA respectively, as well as 15 national federations that have refused to play against Russia.,The court added it would give further information on the proceedings in the next few days once it had ruled on each decision the Russians are challenging.,FIFA said later Tuesday it had agreed, in a “spirit of solidarity,” to Ukraine’s request to postpone its 2022 World Cup playoff against Scotland this month following Russia’s invasion.,Ukraine was set to face Scotland at Glasgow’s Hampden Park on March 24 in a playoff semifinal that will now be staged in June.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,The New York Times,Hockey star Alex Ovechkin, center among Russian professional athletes in the public’s anger over the war in Ukraine, played before the most unsympathetic crowd yet.,Ovechkin, President Vladimir Putin’s high-profile supporter, and his Washington Capitals teammates faced the Oilers on Wednesday night in Edmonton, Alberta, home to one of Canada’s largest concentrations of the Ukrainian diaspora.,
,Andriy Tovstiuk of Edmonton works with the Ukrainian Canadian Congress organizing fundraising, rallies, demonstrations and humanitarian relief efforts in Alberta for Ukraine. He was at Wednesday’s game at Rogers Place.,“I think we’re going to be loud, we’re going to be fired up,” said Tovstiuk, whose organization is working with both the Oilers and the Calgary Flames to raise money for Ukraine through its 50-50 draws, which frequently hit more than $1 million. “But we’re all really wanting to focus on supporting Ukraine and really getting behind everything that’s going on right now.,“It’s an emotional time for everybody, and we really encourage everybody to use this as a rallying point for Ukraine.”,Ovechkin is one of Russia’s most famous athletes, and his friendship with Putin, who has a singular passion for ice hockey, is widely known. The friendship was unwavering after Putin invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, with Ovechkin starting an online social movement in 2017 to support Putin winning the 2018 Russian election.,Edmonton is home to 160,000 people of Ukrainian descent, and there are 370,000 in Alberta, according to the 2016 Canadian census. There are roughly 1.4 million people of Ukrainian background living in Canada, more than anywhere outside Ukraine and Russia.,Officials from the Capitals, who have four Russian players on their roster including Ovechkin, had discussed security measures at Rogers Place with their Oilers counterparts. The Oilers did not respond to requests for comment. The Capitals declined to speak on the record.,Tim Shipton, an executive vice president of Oilers Entertainment Group, issued a statement Monday: “The Edmonton Oilers stand in solidarity alongside the people of Ukraine. As we saw during Saturday’s home game, Oilers fans were very respectful in showing their support for Ukraine.”,On Wednesday night, Viter, a Ukrainian folk choir, performed the Canadian anthem in English and Ukrainian. Oilers players continued to sport Ukrainian flag stickers on their helmets. Fans wearing the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag dotted the stands and hung flags throughout the arena. Every time Ovechkin touched the puck, he was loudly booed. He did not score, and Edmonton won, 4-3, in overtime on a goal from star center Connor McDavid.,On Tuesday, before their first game of the season in Alberta, the Capitals issued a statement saying they “join the National Hockey League in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the loss of innocent life.” The statement continued: “We urge and hope for a peaceful resolution as quickly as possible. The Capitals also stand in full support of our Russian players and their families overseas. We realize they are being put in a difficult situation and stand by to offer our assistance to them and their families.”,Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ovechkin, who is one of the NHL’s biggest stars — two goals in a 5-4 victory on Tuesday against the Flames tied him for third on the career goals list with Jaromir Jagr at 766 — has been jeered and booed during road games. His image was even scorned in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday when he appeared in a tribute video for former Blue Jackets star Rick Nash.,Ovechkin held a news conference Feb. 25 intended to distance himself from Putin and support for the Russian invasion. “I am not in politics. Like, I’m an athlete,” he said. He added, without mentioning Putin, “Please, no more war.”,Instead of calming his detractors, Ovechkin found himself under criticism from supporters of the war in his home country and opponents of it in the rest of the world. This resulted in a severe backlash on Ovechkin’s social media accounts from Russian supporters, and he was advised not to change his Instagram profile picture because it would not go over well in Russia.,That is why Ovechkin’s profile picture, showing him with Putin, on his verified Instagram account, which has 1.6 million followers, remained as of Wednesday afternoon. There was a plan to change the picture to a symbol for world peace after the news conference, but since Ovechkin’s wife, two children and parents are in Russia, it was decided the photo of him and Putin would stay.,Ovechkin and Flames defenseman Nikita Zadorov are the only Russian players to publicly mention the war. Zadorov posted a Ukrainian flag emoji and the words “No war” and “STOP IT!!!” on Instagram the day after the invasion.,According to player agent Dan Milstein, who represents dozens of Russian and Belarusian players with NHL contracts, his clients and their families are facing a barrage of abuse and profanity on platforms like Instagram and Twitter.,“I have had wives of my players receiving very disturbing messages,” Milstein said. “The comments under children’s pictures are Nazi baby, get back to Russia, we don’t need you here, go home, among other things.”,Milstein, who is a native of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was the only person connected with the NHL who would agree to speak on the record for this article, with others citing fear of repercussions for associates or clients who have family members in Russia.,An NHL spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment from Commissioner Gary Bettman. But the league is working with police services in some of its 32 team cities to provide extra patrols around the arenas and homes of players.,Milstein said his Russian clients on NHL rosters want nothing to do with the war in Ukraine but fear the consequences of speaking out.,“Of course, they’re worried not only about their families but also they are extremely worried about what is happening in Russia,” he said. “My clients don’t want the war, my clients want world peace. My clients are concerned for all the people in Ukraine and Russia, everybody.”,Hockey equipment maker CCM said last week it would stop using Ovechkin and other Russian players in global marketing campaigns.,Russian and Belarusian players and teams have been barred from all international competitions by the International Ice Hockey Federation. They also face calls for sanctions from fans, some governments and even Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky.,Gretzky, 61, and still one of the most influential people in hockey, called for Russia to be barred from the rescheduled 2022 men’s world junior tournament shortly before the IIHF barred the country. He later explained on the Toronto radio station Sportsnet 590 that he was thinking of the large numbers of people of Ukrainian descent who live in Canada, especially Edmonton, where the tournament will be played in August.,“I just couldn’t relate to how we were going to welcome a country that is at war, to a city that has tons of Ukrainian family members that are still living in Ukraine,” said Gretzky, who won four Stanley Cup championships with Edmonton. “And I got some pushback from people that said, ‘Why punish the Russian kids?’,“It’s not about punishing the Russian kids. What about the Ukrainian kids that are being killed daily? The Ukrainian kids that are 12 or 14 years old, going to war. I don’t want anybody to be punished. I just think it makes common sense that we shouldn’t compete against this country right now, while they’re at war against an innocent country.”,Last week, the NHL condemned the Russian invasion in an official statement and said it was immediately suspending business relationships in Russia. The league suspended ties with the Kontinental Hockey League, which is largely based in Russia, this week. NHL teams were told to stop communications with KHL teams and agents based in Russia.,The NHL statement also made clear the league’s position on Russian players, saying they “play in the NHL on behalf of their NHL clubs, and not on behalf of Russia.”,Milstein and other player agents said barring Russian NHL players made no sense and would play into the hands of Putin, who continues the Russian government tradition of using elite athletes as propaganda.,The player agents also criticized the Canadian Hockey League, the umbrella group that oversees the three major junior leagues. The CHL recently announced it canceled this year’s Russia-Canada series. It is also considering a ban on Russian and Belarusian prospects from its import draft, which distributes teenage players from countries outside North America to CHL teams. Doing so, Milstein said, would essentially help Russia, which has reluctance over athletes playing elsewhere.,While some observers critical of Ovechkin, like Hall of Fame goaltender Dominik Hasek, would like him barred for his support of Putin, others think suspending him and other Russians would not help the situation.,Slava Malamud, a teacher in Baltimore who was a journalist for many years in Russia, has a strong following on social media as a staunch critic of Ovechkin. While Malamud said he would not have a problem with Ovechkin’s being barred from the NHL because of his support for Putin, he did not think punishing all Russian players would be fair.,“We’re not punishing Russians for being Russian,” he said. “You can’t help where you are born. But players who have explicitly supported Putin, first and foremost Ovechkin, have this on their conscience. He is stained by this. He did it very willingly.”,

			,Kyodo,Artistic gymnastics great Kohei Uchimura had his last hurrah on Saturday, as the 2012 and 2016 Olympic men’s all-around gold medalist retired after performing at a packed Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.,The winner of a staggering 40 straight tournaments in the all-around at home and abroad from 2008 through 2017, Uchimura made one last appearance in a unique event dubbed “Kohei Uchimura the Final,” joined by his nine Japan teammates and a crowd of around 6,500, including his mother and father.,
,Uchimura turned back the clock in his grand finale, performing on each apparatus for the first time since August 2019, when injuries to both shoulders forced him to stop competing in the six-apparatus all-around.,A six-time individual all-around world champion, Uchimura announced the event when he told a Jan. 14 press conference he would retire after a unique farewell exhibition.,“I really want to say thank you to everyone who supported me up till this day,” he said after being tossed in the air six times by other guest gymnasts, including Kenzo Shirai, with whom he won team gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and Tokyo Games all-around champion Daiki Hashimoto.,“It’s been 30 years since I started gymnastics, and there’s only been arduousness. But the joy of winning with my Japan teammates here, as well as individually, and that of learning new techniques eventually began to eclipse that.,“My entire body has been aching since I’ve finished. Half of me is saying it was a good call to retire, the other half says I can still carry on.”,While no scores were awarded for the day’s performances, Uchimura was close to his impeccable best. He nailed the smooth landings that have defined his career on the floor exercise, pommel horse and rings as two other gymnasts joined him on each apparatus.,A solid parallel bars routine was sandwiched by a slight step out on his vault and horizontal bar landings. He sparkled once more, however, by nailing a Bretschneider on the horizontal bar, the apparatus’ most difficult move.,At the Tokyo Games, he fell and made an early exit, while he finished sixth on the apparatus at October’s world championships, held in his birthplace of Kitakyushu, before deciding to call it a career.,“I was too close to the bar with all the release moves, and I couldn’t nail the landing at the end. That’s why this event was called ‘the Final,'” joked Uchimura.,“I’m giving myself a mark of 60 (out of 100). I was made aware again of how grueling it is to compete on six apparatuses. It was frightening to think I used to do them perfectly.,“I wanted to carry on forever, but my horizontal bar wasn’t so great at the Olympics and world championships last year, and today also. I had felt it was about the right time.”,It was a fitting stage to bow out for a man nicknamed the “king” of the sport with his fellow 2016 team gold medalists and 2020 Tokyo games gymnasts from Japan joining the action.,“As long as I live, I’ll never forget performing together on the horizontal bar in your final performance,” said 20-year-old Hashimoto, the heir to Uchimura’s all-around title, who is expected to lead Japanese artistic gymnastics in the years ahead.,“I’m coming to grips with the size of what you’ve built after seeing how big an impact your retirement is having on the world of gymnastics at home and abroad. I can’t believe I’m speaking these words to someone I used to watch on TV.”,“We’ll inherit what you’ve done for us and try to get the team gold in Paris to prove to the world Japan is the best.”,Shirai, the 25-year-old Rio Games vault bronze medalist, retired last June but made a special comeback and electrified the crowd with the twisting techniques that bear his name on the floor and vault.,“Thank you for giving everyone dreams, hope and courage,” said Shirai, who was 10 when Uchimura spotted his talent. “What you are going to do next is filling the hearts of gymnasts and fans alike with excitement.”,Uchimura, who also won team silver at the 2012 London Games, reiterated his desire to pass on his experience and help Japanese artistic gymnastics evolve, vowing to remain in the limelight in a new capacity.,“I’ve seen many people crying, but I’m really positive as I see this as not an end but a new step,” said Uchimura, who thanked his parents for giving him his strong body.,“I can still move and will convey to younger gymnasts how to pursue techniques in ways only I can offer … I want to be the one who knows most about gymnastics. I want to research it, popularize it and increase its value within society.,“I’ve enjoyed one happy career as a gymnast.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,French judo great Teddy Riner will resume competing in July after a post-Olympics break, and has his sights set on the 2024 Paris Games, where the 32-year-old dreams of winning one last gold, he says.,The 10-time world champion, who holds the most world titles in the history of the sport, said during a training session in Rio de Janeiro he would return to competition at the Budapest Grand Slam from July 8 to 10.,
,“We’ll see how that first tournament goes. I’m giving myself time. I’d like to go to the world championships in October (in Tashkent, Uzbekistan), but we’ll see,” he said in an interview Friday, taking a break from his first international training session since his six-month hiatus.,One thing is certain: Despite an aging body and struggles with injury, he wants to compete before a home crowd at the Paris Olympics before he calls it quits, he said.,“My whole family, all my friends are going to be in the stadium. It will be like having an extra lung,” said the 204-centimeter heavyweight, who currently weighs in at around 148 kilos.,“But I’m not putting pressure on myself. There’s a long road to travel. I have to train, because I wouldn’t want to disappoint, but above all because I want to really enjoy this last competition.”,The three-time Olympic gold medalist, who had to settle for bronze in Tokyo but managed to help France to team gold, said a final gold in Paris would be “the pinnacle” of his career.,“But whatever happens, I won’t be disappointed. I’ve had the career I’ve had, and I’m grateful to everyone who has helped make it possible,” he said.,“Whatever happens now is a bonus. No stress. I want to push the limits and shine in front of the home crowd, win the most beautiful medal of all. But whatever is meant to be will be.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska reached the Lyon WTA quarterfinals on Thursday, less than a week after escaping Russian bomb attacks on her home city of Odessa, and insisted: “I want to win for my country”.,The 21-year-old arrived on court with a Ukraine flag draped around her shoulders and was celebrating a comfortable 6-2, 6-3 win over Spain’s Cristina Bucsa just over an hour later,
,“I was very nervous because I want to win the matches for my country. This tournament is very emotional for me. But I’m very happy with the win today,” Yastremska, a former top-25 player now ranked 140th, said on court.,“I was able to control my emotions better than in my first match and that’s why I was able to deliver a good performance.,At her postmatch news conference, she added: “This is another victory for me and another victory for my country. We’ll see what happens on Friday (in the quarterfinals), if I can raise my physical level.”,In her opening match on Tuesday, she had to save two match points in a marathon win against Ana Bogdan.,Afterwards, she spoke of how she was “woken up by bombs” when Russia invaded Ukraine last week, before embarking on an arduous journey to France.,Her father and mother remained in the Black Sea port city of Odessa after saying goodbye to their daughters when they crossed the Danube by boat to reach Romania.,Yastremska, who has won three WTA titles but none since May 2019, also played doubles in Lyon with her 15-year-old sister Ivanna on Monday.,“On Wednesday, we were at home in Odessa. We were spending time with our family before making this long trip to Lyon with my father,” she explained.,“The evening was pleasant, but the next morning we were woken up by bombs.,“We didn’t realize or understand what was going on. It was crazy. It wasn’t a film or a video game — we were very shocked.,“We left the apartment to take shelter in the underground car park while the bombs continued to explode.”,She added: “The journey took four hours to reach the Danube on the Romanian border. We were afraid of bombs or Russian tanks.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Men’s tennis governing body has handed world No. 3 Alexander Zverev a suspended eight-week ban for smashing his racket against the umpire’s chair at last month’s ATP 500 event in Acapulco, for which he was expelled from the tournament.,Zverev was fined $20,000 for verbal abuse, $20,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and forfeited more than $31,000 in prize money and all rankings points earned from singles and doubles action at the Abierto Mexicano tournament.,
,Following a review, the ATP found the 24-year-old German had committed “aggravated behavior” and issued an additional fine of $25,000 and an eight-week ban from any ATP-sanctioned event.,The ATP said, however, the ban and the additional fine were suspended, providing that over a probation period ending one year after the incident, Zverev does not incur any more fines for unsportsmanlike conduct.,After losing in doubles at Acapulco and upset over a line call in the match, Zverev approached umpire Alessandro Germani’s chair and came perilously close to hitting him as he swung at the official’s stand before heading towards his courtside seat.,The 2020 U.S. Open runner-up then approached the chair a second time and again hit it while shouting expletives.,Shortly before the match ended, Germani handed Zverev a code violation for yelling and swearing in protest of the shot that was ruled in and set up match point.,Zverev, who was the singles defending champion, apologized for his behaviour.,The biggest penalty in men’s tennis to date was handed down to Australian Nick Kyrgios in 2019 for verbally abusing a chair umpire and smashing two rackets. After an initial fine of $113,000, he was given a suspended ban of 16 weeks and an additional fine of $25,000 following an ATP investigation.,Italy’s Fabio Fognini was also provisionally suspended for two Grand Slam tournaments and fined $96,000 following the 2017 U.S. Open where he had directed vulgar language toward Swedish chair umpire Louise Engzell during his first-round loss.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Red-hot Rafael Nadal will be the man to beat when Indian Wells kicks off this week while Naomi Osaka will look to begin her ascent back to the top of the tennis world at the tournament that launched her career.,Nadal’s season was cut short last year due to a foot injury but the Spaniard has come roaring out of the gates in 2022, winning January’s Australian Open for a men’s record 21st Grand Slam title.,
,He followed that up by winning his fourth title in Acapulco last month and has not lost in 15 matches this season.,“Rafa Nadal is now 35 years old and he’s never had a start to the season like this one,” Indian Wells tournament director and former player Tommy Haas said on a recent podcast.,“He’s the guy to beat here, there’s no doubt about it. And he obviously enjoys it here very much,” Haas said of Nadal, who has won the Masters 1000 tournament three times.,As a bonus, while in the Southern California desert, Nadal will stay at tournament owner and billionaire Larry Ellison’s private resort, Porcupine Creek Golf Club.,“He can play 18 to 36 holes of golf every day if he wants to,” Haas said.,“He likes it there and wants to stay for as long as he can. If he’s healthy, watch out.”,His Serbian rival Novak Djokovic was placed into the tournament’s draw on Tuesday despite his ongoing refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine, which would bar the world number two from entry into the country.,“Novak Djokovic is on the tournament entry list, and therefore is placed into the draw today,” tournament organisers wrote on Twitter Tuesday.,“We are currently in communication with his team; however, it has not been determined if he will participate in the event by getting CDC approval to enter the country.”,Swiss Roger Federer will not be at the tournament as he is still recovering from knee surgery, while a cadre of emerging stars will be eager to topple Nadal.,Chief among them is Daniil Medvedev, who enters a tournament as the world number one for the first time, and big-serving Andrey Rublev, who won a title in Dubai last month.,Both players are from Russia but they will not compete under the name or flag of their country, a decision handed down by tennis authorities following Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine.,“There are a lot of guys knocking on the door but Nadal has got to be the favorite,” Haas said.,
,On the women’s side, opportunity knocks for Naomi Osaka, who as a 20-year-old announced herself with a triumph at the WTA 1000 event in 2018.,From there she won four Grand Slams, became the world’s highest-paid female athlete and sparked a conversation about mental health in sports.,But time away from the court after last year’s U.S. Open has caused her world ranking to plummet and the former world number one is now No. 78 and unseeded at the tournament.,“I’ve heard she’s in a wonderful place, a much better space than she was last year, and that she’s excited to get back out and competing,” three-time grand slam champion Lindsay Davenport said.,Osaka, who fell in the third round at the Australian Open, will face an in-form Sloane Stephens in a first-round blockbuster on Wednesday.,“That’s a really tough one to start off with, and Osaka is going to have to be ready to go,” Davenport said.,“I think she was a little disappointed with how Australia went and that she’s pretty motivated, but it’s going to take a lot of work.”,Davenport predicted a big year for Osaka and said her powerful game translates well on grass.,“If I were on her team, I would put a focus on trying to get her to believe that she could win Wimbledon.”,Osaka will not have to worry about facing world number one Ash Barty or top-ranked American Danielle Collins after both players withdrew from Indian Wells due to injury.,The tournament, which is officially called the BNP Paribas Open, returns to its March date on the calendar after being canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and being moved to October last year.,Full stands are expected at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden for what is sometimes referred to as the sport’s “fifth major.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka returns to Indian Wells, the scene of her breakthrough triumph in 2018, with a new outlook on a tennis career that plunged into turmoil in 2021.,The Japanese star will take the court for the first time since a third-round exit in her Australian Open title defense in January when she faces Sloane Stephens, the 2017 U.S. Open champion, in a first-round match at the prestigious hardcourt tournament in the California desert.,
,Osaka said she feels a new sense of confidence after her well-documented struggles in 2021 — which put a spotlight on the mental health of athletes in a wide range of sports.,She said even her loss to American Amanda Anisimova in Melbourne reassured her she was on the right path.,“Honestly, I feel like I’m at peace with myself, which I think is a great feeling to have as a person,” Osaka said Wednesday.,“For me, the biggest focus this year is, of course, I want to do well in every tournament,” she added.,“But I think just knowing that I tried as hard as I could and I enjoyed myself … I felt the difference in Australia.,“I actually left the court thinking, ‘You know what, I did my best.’ And I had match points. That was pretty good.”,Osaka withdrew from the French Open last year and skipped Wimbledon, saying she had struggled with depression. She was eliminated early at the Tokyo Olympics. She then made a tearful early exit at the U.S. Open and announced she would take a hiatus from tennis.,“I’ve learned to enjoy my time more,” she said. “This moment in my life, playing tennis, I’ve trained my entire life for it. But when I’m 70, it will probably be a small chapter for me. So I have to enjoy it while I still can.,“I’m just trying to appreciate every tournament.”,Osaka said she’d been encouraged not only by her own ability to enjoy herself more since her return to the court, but also by the new expectations of fans she’s encountered as she goes about her pre-tournament business at Indian Wells.,“I’m really grateful because I was watching qualifying the other day here and was walking around and usually when I walk around, people are like ‘win the tournament, I have tickets to the final’ kind of thing,” Osaka said.,“And, actually people were just saying, ‘I hope you have fun.’ I know that’s not the biggest difference, but it really meant a lot to me.”,Osaka said she doesn’t “live in the past anymore” but acknowledged it was nice to be back in Indian Wells, the WTA 1000 tournament she won in 2018 to claim her first title,Osaka was unseeded then, beating top-ranked Simona Halep in the semifinals on the way to what was the biggest title of her career.,In her first appearance in three years, she is in rebuild mode. Her Australian Open exit saw her drop out of the top-80 in the world and she drew a tough first-round clash against Stephens — who ended a four-year title drought with a victory in Guadalajara two weeks ago.,“I’m going to have to put a lot of energy into that,” Osaka said.,Although neither enjoys the first-round bye afforded the top 32 seeds, Osaka and Stephens are among the biggest names in a field that is missing top-ranked Ashleigh Barty and world No. 2 Barbora Krejcikova.,Barty withdrew saying she had not yet recovered from her triumphant Australian Open campaign, and the woman she beat in the Melbourne final, American Danielle Collins, was also a late withdrawal with an unspecified injury.,Krejcikova, the reigning French Open champion, pulled out with an elbow injury.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Naomi Osaka battled windy conditions and an in-form Sloane Stephens to earn a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 first round victory at Indian Wells on Thursday.,In a showdown of former U.S. Open champions, Osaka struggled in the first set amid the mighty gusts in her first match since January.,
,After a lackluster first set, Osaka turned a switch in the second, racing out to a 4-0 lead as her serve and defense suddenly improved.,Osaka pounced on a short ball from Stephens and her swinging backhand volley caught the line to even the match at a set apiece.,Stephens, who won a title in Guadalajara last month, held a 2-0 lead and had break point chances for 3-0 in the third but failed to convert.,That would prove crucial as Osaka seized the momentum to take the final six games, sealing her first career win over the American when her forehand failed to clear the net on match point.,“I haven’t played in wind in a while so this was very new to me,” Osaka said in an on-court interview on the Stadium Court.,“I felt like I was fighting for my life. I was playing against her, I was playing against this wind. It was crazy.,“But I kept thinking that she was going through the same circumstances as me, so I just have to will myself to try as hard as I could.”,A four-time Grand Slam champion, the Japanese former world number one has seen her ranking fall to 78 coming into the tournament after she took a break from tennis after last year’s U.S. Open to prioritize her mental health.,Prior to the start of the tournament that she won in 2018, she said she had a new perspective on tennis and is “at peace with myself.”,Next up for Osaka is a second round match against Veronika Kudermetova.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka was reduced to tears by a heckler Saturday on the way to a 6-0, 6-4 second-round loss to Veronika Kudermetova at Indian Wells.,Japan’s Osaka, ranked 78th in the world after her third-round exit at the Australian Open, was rocked early in the first set when someone in the crowd yelled “Naomi, you suck.”,
,She was unable to convince the chair umpire to take action and at 0-3 down her emotions spilled over.,Osaka quickly pulled herself together and resumed the match, but even though she raised her game in the second set she could find no answer for Kudermetova, a finalist this year at the Melbourne Summer Set and in Dubai.,Osaka put athlete mental health in the spotlight in a difficult 2021 in which she revealed she had suffered depression.,But speaking on court after the match she said it wasn’t that she found the comment so hurtful that she was upset, but because it reminded her of Venus and Serena Williams being heckled at Indian Wells in 2001.,“To be honest I feel like I’ve been heckled before it didn’t really bother me,” she said.,“But, like, I’ve watched a video of Venus and Serena being heckled here.,“If you’ve never watched it you should watch it,” she added, tearing up again before she congratulated Kudermetova on the win and departed the court.,Kudermetova, who had been looking forward to her first career meeting with Osaka, said she didn’t know what the spectator said, she just knew her opponent was upset.,“I didn’t hear what the lady say because I really was so focused on my game, on my serve game, I didn’t understand what she say.,“But after that moment, I saw that Naomi, she start to cry. I don’t understand what’s happen.”,With Osaka’s defeat the women’s field in the prestigious WTA and ATP Masters hard court tournament lost another big name.,Aryna Sabalenka, at No. 3 the highest-ranked woman in the field, crashed out of her opening match as Italian Jasmine Paolini rallied for a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 triumph.,Sabalenka was seeded second in a tournament missing both world No. 1 Ash Barty and second-ranked Barbora Krejcikova.,Both were late withdrawals, Barty saying she hadn’t had time to prepare after her Australian Open triumph and Krejcikova with an elbow injury.,Sabalenka got off to a strong start against the 46th-ranked Italian, but Paolini was able to capitalize on her struggles on serve that included 10 double faults.,Paolini admitted that after dropping the first set by a large margin, victory was the last thing on her mind.,“I mean, the score was 6-2 for her,” she said. “I wasn’t even close to her.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez scored two goals each as Manchester City restored its lead at the top of the Premier League to six points with a convincing 4-1 derby victory over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.,United put up a decent fight in the first half, going down just 2-1, but City’s quality showed after the interval with Ralf Rangnick’s side looking increasingly demoralized.,
,City has 69 points from 28 games with Liverpool on 63 with a game in hand. United sliped down to fifth place, a point behind Arsenal which beat Watford on Sunday and have three games in hand.,Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said his team’s display it remains as hungry as ever for success despite already having trophy-filled seasons under the Spanish coach.,“I said many times the biggest form of success for a manager is that after winning three Premier Leagues in the last four years we still run like we run and we are still there to win again,” he said.,“You can get confused and think like maybe you are what you are not. Still we are humble enough to do it again and again and be up there. After these guys have been there many years,” he added.,De Bruyne was outstanding, running the game from central midfield and then presenting himself as a threat in the box.,United was without Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani due to injuries and Rangnick surprisingy opted to play Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes in forward positions.,City made the perfect start with De Bruyne putting his club ahead in the fifth minute by slotting home a low pulled-back pass from Bernardo Silva after they overloaded the left side.,United drew level through a superb curling shot from Jadon Sancho, who took his time and cut inside after a swift break before beating Ederson with his confident strike.,De Bruyne later restored City’s advantage, finding the target after Phil Foden powered into the area and saw his shot parried out by David De Gea.,City dominated after the break and made it 3-1 when De Bruyne struck a corner deep to the edge of the box and Mahrez met it with a first-time drive that took a slight deflection off Harry Maguire.,Mahrez completed the victory with a goal that was initially flagged as offside. VAR, however, found Alex Telles had played the Algerian onside before he latched on to an Ilkay Gundogan pass and blasted in off De Gea’s story.,“It was excellent from the first minute,” Guardiola said. “We played really well and had to be patient in the first step.”,“Football is emotions. It’s tactics, definitely, but it’s also emotions. Without the ball, we are a team with desire and passion to regain the ball from the first minute to the 90th,” he added.,Rangnick felt his tactics had been the right way to take on City before the gulf in class became evident.,“It was working,” he said. “For us it was clear if we want a chance to win the game we have to do a lot of running. You have to be in attacking and hunting mode and we did that in the first half. The third goal killed us off in the end.”,“It’s difficult, if we attack them very high there is a lot of negative running you need to do. The third goal is a brilliantly taken corner and it is almost impossible to defend that. The second half they were the better team and they showed the quality they have. We struggled especially after they scored the third one.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Real Madrid pulled off one of the great Champions League comebacks on Wednesday, as Karim Benzema scored a breathtaking hat trick to upstage Kylian Mbappe and eliminate Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.,Madrid was set to be the latest victim of another Mbappe masterclass, after the 23-year-old ran the Spanish giant ragged for the better part of an hour and scored to put PSG ahead 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate.,
,Madrid came storming back, however, as Benzema capitalized on a mistake by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and then scored an incredible double in two minutes, with the third coming within 11 seconds after PSG kicked off.,When the full-time whistle confirmed the 3-2 aggregate victory, many of Madrid’s players dropped to their knees and looked up to the sky, as much perhaps in disbelief as joy.,“Every game is a final now for us in the Champions League and La Liga but today we showed that Real Madrid is alive,” Benzema said.,Manchester City also reached the quarterfinals, sailing through after a scoreless draw against Sporting Lisbon in their last-16 second leg match. City progressed 5-0 on aggregate. Manchester City had already done the hard work in its thrashing of the Portuguese side in the first leg three weeks ago in Lisbon, and could take it easy against an inferior Sporting at Etihad Stadium.,For PSG, it was another epic collapse to add to a growing list of Champions League disappointments, with Mauricio Pochettino’s future as coach immediately cast into doubt.,Even with Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar, the Qatari-owned club’s wait for a Champions League crown goes on.,“We didn’t manage our emotions well. We left ourselves exposed,” Pochettino said. “We leave with great pain and disappointment because we didn’t score the goals to reflect our superiority over the two games.”,Pochettino also fumed at referee Danny Makkelie for not whistling for a foul as Benzema challenged Donnarumma before Madrid’s first goal.,“Explaining what happened is easy, there was a foul on Donnarumma during the first goal, and that changed everything,” he said.,All eyes were on Mbappe, the only player to be cheered by Madrid’s fans before the game as they were gifted an up-close preview of the player they hope will be theirs this summer.,Mbappe delivered, scoring a superb goal, not to mention a spellbinding second that was disallowed for offside.,But what looked set to become an exhibition of the world’s deadliest player instead became another remarkable European night for Real Madrid and another nightmare for PSG.,“We suffered a lot but we endured,” Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said. “Karim gave us the chance to score the first goal and then the magic came. From then on, there was only one team was on the field.”,Madrid clearly wanted to hit PSG hard from the start and for a while, it worked, with Vinicius Junior tearing down the left and Fede Valverde bulldozing through Mbappe.,But the surge was brief, with PSG killing Madrid’s momentum, pushing them back and taking complete control.,Mbappe sped clear for the first time in the eighth minute, with Neymar curling a ball into the space on the left. The stadium held its breath, Mbappe made room but this time hit Courtois.,PSG was comfortable, dictating the play and sensing the trepidation. Madrid had openings, Benzema curling just wide, but all over the pitch Real looked slower, heavier and more cumbersome.,Lionel Messi skipped through and scooped wide before Mbappe had his first of two goals ruled out, driving into the corner only to see the flag raised.,The opener, though, felt inevitable. Dani Carvajal lost the ball upfield and with Madrid committed, Neymar arced another brilliant pass over the top.,By the time he reached it, Mbappe only had David Alaba in front of him and as he set up to bend into the far corner, he instead fired early, whipping a deadly shot past Courtois and inside the near post.,Madrid tried to reset at halftime, but Mbappe picked up where he left off with a brilliant, but disallowed, goal.,He fooled Courtois with an astonishing dummy shot, beating the Belgian without even touching the ball and slammed in. The flag went up but the stadium was astounded.,The game was becoming less a contest, more an Mbappe exhibition before Benzema, out of nowhere, dragged Madrid back into the tie.,He chased Nuno Mendes’ backpass to Donnarumma, who skewed under pressure. Vinicius was able to collect and cut back to Benzema, who slotted home.,It was Luka Modric who inspired Madrid’s second, as his scintillating run through midfield allowed Vinicius to race clear down the left. He scooped back inside to Modric, whose exquisite reverse pass found Benzema, who finished.,Madrid was level on aggregate, as the goal was confirmed after a check from VAR. Then just seconds later, incredibly, they were ahead. PSG squandered possession from kick-off, Rodrygo released Vinicius and Marquinhos’ attempted clearance found Benzema, who steered into the corner.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-JIJI,Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has vowed the team will not be destroyed by the sanctions on Blues owner Roman Abramovich that plunged the European champions into turmoil before their 3-1 win at Norwich on Thursday.,Abramovich was one of seven more oligarchs slapped with new British restrictions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,
,The Russian billionaire’s UK assets have been frozen, with strict restrictions placed on Chelsea, who are currently not allowed to sign new players, renew contracts or sell match tickets.,Even Chelsea’s club shop has been closed, while their main shirt sponsor, mobile phone company Three, responded to the sanctions by saying it was temporarily suspending the £40 million ($52 million) deal.,The sanctions have raised fears for Chelsea’s survival, but Blues boss Tuchel insisted after the Premier League victory against Norwich that his team would not be throwing in the towel.,“So far we can trust each other and this will not change. As long as we have enough shirts and a bus to drive to the games we will be there and will compete hard,” he said.,“Everybody can be very sure that we focus on us, to keep the attitude and the mentality right on the training ground and within the team.”,
,Reports on Thursday claimed sportswear giant Nike, which makes Chelsea’s kit, was also considering ending the £900 million, 15-year deal it signed with the club in 2016.,Car manufacturer Hyundai said it is “currently assessing” its contract with the Blues.,Chelsea, no longer allowed to spend more than £20,000 on away travel, will continue to receive TV broadcast payments and prize money, but this is set to be frozen.,They have been given a special license to continue playing, but Chelsea officials were holding talks with the government on Thursday to discuss the scope of that arrangement.,Abramovich had already announced he was willing to sell Chelsea, with a host of potential buyers declaring their interest in a club which has won 19 major trophies since the Russian bought them in 2003.,Tuchel has no idea which direction the club will head once Abramovich is gone, but he will not worry about problems he cannot control.,“I didn’t see that coming yesterday and I don’t know what is coming tomorrow,” Tuchel said.,“The level of impact it has, the news of today is big, in time we don’t know how big. We cannot influence it.”,There has been speculation Tuchel might quit Chelsea given their suddenly turbulent situation.,But the German, who has won the Champions League and Club World Cup since he was hired by Abramovich in January 2021, remains happy at the west London club.,“I am still happy to be here and still happy to be manager of a strong team,” he said.,Chelsea are third in the Premier League after easing past lowly Norwich to move nine points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United in the race for a top-four finish.,They are also still in contention in the Champions League last 16 and FA Cup quarter-finals.,Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen are all out of contract this summer and could be forgiven for letting the uncertainty affect their play.,Tuchel will use Chelsea’s top-four and trophy targets to keep his players focused amid the mayhem, but he conceded he was concerned they might be distracted before the Norwich game.,“It would be a lie if I said we I had no doubts but I also had a lot of trust,” he said.,“In difficult circumstances we produced a lot of results and good performances so we can trust in our mentality and the culture in the club. We allowed ourselves to focus on the football.”,Mason Mount, one of Chelsea’s scorers at Norwich, added: “You can’t really avoid it as there’s a lot going on.,“We have to focus on what we do on the pitch. You try not to look too much into it.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Yokohama F. Marinos defender Yuki Saneto netted a spectacular overhead equalizer with the final kick of the game Saturday to salvage a 1-1 draw against Consadole Sapporo in the J. League first division.,Having arrived at Sapporo Dome in first place on goal difference, Marinos trailed 1-0 following Daiki Suga’s second-half opener and looked destined for an upset until Saneto’s 95th-minute heroics.,
,After a ball into the box flew high off the head of teammate Anderson Lopes, the 33-year-old Saneto connected with the acrobatic bicycle kick that hit the bottom of the crossbar and landed over the goal line.,The result left Mihailo Petrovic’s squad still searching for their first win of the campaign, with draws in all four J1 matches this season.,Suga gave the hosts the lead in the 70th minute when he fired a tightly angled shot across Marinos keeper Yohei Takaoka and into the net off the inside of the far post.,Kevin Muscat’s men created the better of the first-half chances, with midfielder Joel Chima Fujita hitting the post early and Sapporo keeper Takanori Sugeno stopping attempts from Lopes and fellow Brazilian attacker Elber.,“I think we (missed) a number of chances, particularly in the first half,” former Australia defender Muscat said. “But in the end, we got an equalizer in the last second … so no complaints.”,Two-time defending champions Kawasaki Frontale are top with 13 points, two ahead of Yokohama, after Marcinho’s 25th-minute winner was enough to see off Nagoya Grampus 1-0 at home.,In other J1 action, Cerezo Osaka were 3-1 winners away to Shimizu S-Pulse, while Jubilo Iwata drew 1-1 at home to Gamba Osaka after Leandro Pereira netted the visitors’ 88th-minute equalizer.,FC Tokyo overcame Sanfrecce Hiroshima 2-1 at home, Kashiwa Reysol beat visiting Avispa Fukuoka 1-0, and Kyoto Sanga secured a 1-1 draw away to Shonan Bellmare after being reduced to 10 men for the second straight game.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing Writer,Is the spring sumo tournament in danger of being canceled?,The question has suddenly arisen as Japan’s national sport struggles to deal with a wave of infections that has already resulted in two of sumo’s most significant one-day meets being called off in the past week.,
,The 46th edition of the Fuji TV-backed Japan Grand Sumo Tournament and the 54th running of NHK’s Charity Grand Sumo, scheduled for Feb. 6 and 11 respectively, will not be taking place.,Holding the events became untenable when the omicron explosion in Japan reached sumo and resulted in a large number of high-profile wrestlers, including , Terunofuji and January tournament winner Mitakeumi, testing positive for the virus.,Daily coronavirus cases nationwide had dropped ,, but have skyrocketed in early February — ,.,Vaccinations have of course reduced both COVID-19’s lethality and severity, resulting in a smaller percentage of people requiring hospitalization, but the sheer number of cases nationwide caused by the rapidly spreading omicron variant has counterbalanced that improvement somewhat.,Provisional figures indicate Tuesday had the second highest daily COVID-19-related death toll to date — 159 — since the pandemic began.,With quasi-emergency declarations being extended in many prefectures, fans in Osaka missing out on live sumo for a third straight year has to be considered a possibility,
,
,However, even with the challenges omicron has brought, an outright cancellation of the upcoming spring tournament seems improbable.,Barring another mass outbreak just before the March meet gets under way, the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) is unlikely to scrap a tournament while most wrestlers are healthy and able to compete.,Similarly, moving the entire JSA organization to Osaka only to hold a , behind closed doors, like what happened in 2020, doesn’t make much sense from a logistical or financial point of view.,Keeping everyone in the Tokyo area and hosting the spring tournament at the Kokugikan though must be in the cards.,Such a move would both avoid the possibility of falling victim to various local restrictions on sporting events crossing prefectural borders — as happened recently with one American football league — and afford the JSA maximum flexibility in terms of ticket sales if the situation improved mid-basho.,While the Osaka meet is scheduled to get under way on March 13, having to transport equipment, food and clothing across the country requires an early move west.,Without permanent bases in Kansai — or sumo’s other regional venues — temporary lodgings not owned by stables are used when sumo leaves the capital.,Temples and shrines are common hosts, but most don’t have existing practice rings and so wrestlers normally need to spend their first few days in Osaka each year building their own rings and training facilities,To ensure adequate preparation time, sumo stables generally pack up and move to the Kansai area during the last week of February, meaning a decision on whether or not to proceed with the meet in Osaka needs to be made soon.,If the JSA decides to stay in Tokyo, hold a spectatorless meet or cancel the spring tournament entirely it will be a bitter blow to fans in sumo’s birthplace.,The last time a tournament took place in Osaka in front of fans, Hakuho and Kakuryu were the active yokozuna, while Takayasu, Goeido and Tochinoshin occupied the , ranks.,Only two of those men are still competing and both of their positions in the top division seem increasingly less secure.,Sumo has witnessed the greatest wrestler in the history of the sport call it a day and a new power rise during its three-year long hiatus from Osaka’s supporters.,For the sake of those in that region and the health of the sport in general, it is vital that sumo returns to Kansai as soon as possible.,
,
,If the upcoming meet is canceled or moved, some will point fingers at the JSA and say the organization could have done more to prevent the current outbreak from being so widespread.,Public relations department head Shibatayama’s comment — in relation to Terunofuji’s recent bout against Mitakeumi a day before the latter tested positive — saying that just doing sumo doesn’t necessarily make someone a close contact raised many eyebrows.,That reaction turned to outright annoyance online when the yokozuna — and numerous others that had participated in the same retirement ceremony — subsequently were found to be infected.,With the speed at which omicron spreads rendering previous COVID-19 countermeasures insufficient worldwide however, it’s unclear if the JSA could realistically have prevented the outbreak — especially given that it has followed all official government guidelines and even added extra restrictions of its own since the pandemic began.,It can also be hard to know exactly what the correct approach to dealing with COVID-19 in a sporting context is at this stage. The contrast between The Japan Times staff writer Dan Orlowitz reporting on full-body , while stadiums are full of maskless fans in Europe and the U.S. is stark, and it shows that politics, culture and simple weariness after two years of restrictions all play a part in these decisions.,The middle ground path taken in Japan, with no lockdowns and a heavy reliance on people wearing masks, following guidelines and getting vaccinated, has been relatively successful and allowed sumo to hold tournaments at three of the sport’s four regular venues since the pandemic started.,The exception to that success is Osaka, being the only location where fans have missed out completely since COVID-19 began.,Everyone in sumo is hoping that’s a situation that will be remedied next month.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,It’s always darkest just before the dawn.,That’s an old cliche, but one that has become relevant again as omicron’s massive infection waves are increasingly being seen around the world as heralding the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.,
,A combination of factors — ranging from high vaccination rates to the aforementioned variant’s seemingly less-lethal impact and simple fatigue with bad news — have resulted in numerous countries removing some, if not all, of the coronavirus-related restrictions that had been in place over the past two years.,Following the death of singer Meat Loaf in January, Irish writer Colm Tobin went viral with a tweet suggesting that “,,” despite infection numbers in that country still being higher than at any point prior to December 2021.,Tweets like that don’t go viral if people think COVID-19 is still raging.,With Japan in the middle of its biggest wave to date, and many prefectures under quasi-emergency measures, similarly glib tweets referring to the pandemic in the past tense still seem a long way away here — even with infection numbers declining slightly over the past few days.,Even so, there are signs this year will see a return to a sporting landscape closer to normal than it has been at any time since early 2020.,There may not be the complete and rapid abandonment of restrictions seen internationally, but for sport in general and sumo in particular the coming year figures to be significantly different — and much improved.,While the Japan Sumo Association has managed to hold all but one of its scheduled tournaments since COVID-19 first arrived on these shores, the unique way in which the organization operates has resulted in it taking a far greater hit in one key area.,Sumo has always relied heavily on close-and-personal contact with its supporters to ensure solid finances, healthy recruitment numbers and the long-term viability of the sport.,While foreign media outlets often describe sumo as a “secretive” “hidden world” in their reporting, the reality is that sumo arguably offers far greater accessibility for fans than any other major sport.,That is something which is immediately apparent to every first-time visitor to a tournament.,All wrestlers, bar those at the highest ranks of , and ,, enter and exit through the same gates as the general public, making their way to the dressing room through throngs of fans.,The idea of NFL players carrying their pads through the concourse at the Super Bowl, or stars like Lebron James or Lionel Messi having to queue up with ticket holders at concession stands would be inconceivable, but the equivalent situation is a common sight in sumo.,In pre-pandemic times, , making their way back to stables after their bouts also lingered in the hallways chatting to friends and family, as well as posing for photos or signing autographs.,Outside of official tournaments, access was even greater.,
,
,Visiting a sumo stable to watch training has long been possible for anyone simply willing to get up early in the morning and make their way to Tokyo’s Ryogoku district, and is something with few if any equivalents in other major sports.,While ringside seats at tournaments cost ¥14,300 ($124) and are as rare as gold dust, in pre-pandemic times it was still possible for the general public to simply drop by a stable most mornings, watch the best athletes in the sport train for a few hours and then chat with them afterwards at no cost.,Supporters were regularly invited to eat lunch with the wrestlers after practice as well, and chowing down on healthy and delicious , meals while sitting mere feet away from the training ring is something that many sumo fans have experienced.,Of course, that required living in, or at least traveling to, Tokyo or one of the three regional venues — all major urban areas — that host tournaments.,Those in further flung regions weren’t left out, however.,Regional tours, known as ,, brought sumo to those living far from the capital.,Countless small towns and remote municipalities have played host to sumo throughout the decades on the sport’s regular treks around the country between tournaments.,Those provided an opportunity for schoolchildren, the elderly and others unable to travel to experience the sport up close and in person.,Of course, the JSA also got something in return. Regional events helped the organization’s finances and served as promotional and recruitment tools — though less so recently than in times gone by.,In recent years, the fan service aspect has arguably been one the biggest reasons sumo continued putting so much effort into its jungyō tours.,Other sports may also have meet-and-greet events, but they aren’t an intrinsic part of those sports’ fabrics in the way they are in sumo.,Being prevented from holding jungyō and having to restrict entry to stables has hindered sumo from maintaining its traditionally close relationship with fans over the past two years.,As exciting as the action has been in the ring during the pandemic, the sport has been something missing a key part of what makes it special and unique.,Sumo needs the human touch that only comes from direct interaction.,Plans are in place for a return to touring, but exactly when that will take place isn’t clear.,For the sake of the sport, the sooner the better.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,The ascension of veteran Mitakeumi to the rank of ,and Abi to ,in Monday’s latest Japan Sumo Association rankings put the spotlight on the two wrestlers’ perseverance.,Mitakeumi, a hot prospect out of university, rose rapidly to the three ,ranks below ,, but needed 28 tournaments as a ,or sekiwake before his third grand tournament championship in January put him over the top and earned him promotion to ozeki.,
,Abi, meanwhile, had one foot out of the sumo world in August 2020, when he offered to resign after it was revealed he repeatedly violated coronavirus protocols the previous month. Instead, he served a three-tournament suspension that forced him to restart his career from the third-tier ,division.,Mitakeumi’s 28 tourneys as a sanyaku wrestler before ozeki promotion are fourth most in history and four short of the record 32 set by former ozeki Kaio in 2000. At 29 years and one month, Mitakeumi will be the sixth-oldest wrestler to make his debut at sumo’s second-highest rank.,He is also the first wrestler from Nagano Prefecture to achieve that rank since 1795.,Abi’s suspension lit the same fire under him that once saw him run off one solid tourney after another and propelled him to komusubi in July 2019. But after losing 10 ,-division bouts for the first time in January 2020, he began to slide, until he pulled out of the July tourney when his infractions became known.,In March 2021, he returned to action as a No. 56 makushita. Unbeaten in two seven-bout tourneys in that division, he earned re-promotion to the makuuchi division after going 24-6 in two campaigns as a second-tier ,wrestler.,And after back-to-back 12-win tourneys, Abi is back on track in a new look sanyaku class.,Abi, who made the huge jump from No. 6 maegashira to sekiwake, is joined at the sport’s third-highest rank by another newcomer, 27-year-old dynamo Wakatakakage, who went 9-6 as a No. 1 in January.,The komusubi rank is filled by Takanosho, who went 7-8 as a sekiwake last time, and Hoshoryu, the 22-year-old nephew of former Mongolian yokozuna Asashoryu.,Terunofuji remains at the top of the rankings. Sumo’s lone yokozuna’s surgically repaired knees troubled him in January, when he went 11-4 and saw his two-tourney win streak snapped by Mitakeumi.,The two incumbent ozeki, Shodai and Takakeisho, each failed to win eight bouts in January, making them ,ozeki who will need eight wins in March to avoid demotion to sekiwake.,At the other end of sumo’s top division, Kotokuzan will be making his makuuchi debut as a No. 16 maegashira after going 10-5 as a No. 4 juryo in January, and will be joined by three veterans earning re-promotion, No. 14 Kotoshoho, No. 16 Nishikigi, and No. 17 Kagayaki.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing Writer,Fallout from the invasion of Ukraine reached the sporting world this week, with numerous international governing bodies, including FIFA and World Rugby, imposing suspensions on Russian athletes and teams.,In amateur sumo, repercussions from the conflict between the two countries have long been felt, with 2008 Ukrainian world heavyweight champion Olga Davydko switching allegiance to Russia following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.,
,Davydko won a second world title in 2018, and such has been her new team’s dominance over the past 15 years that the World Games’ decision to bar Russian athletes from this summer’s competition in Alabama has, out of all the sports at the 2022 games, had the greatest impact on sumo.,Fittingly, Ukraine figures to be the biggest beneficiary of Russia’s suspension and should now dominate the women’s tournament while significantly increasing its podium finishes in the men’s competition.,One woman saved from potentially having to play the role of peacemaker between the warring eastern European nations is Katrina Watts.,The Russian-speaking Australian polyglot is arguably the most recognizable figure in global amateur sumo, and someone the International Sumo Federation (IFS) has long relied on to ensure the smooth running of its international meets.,Watts has been a prominent figure in the sport for over 30 years and since the 1990s has been a mainstay at World Championships, where she undertakes numerous roles including stadium announcer, translator, IFS official and general problem-solver.,
,
,Unlike most non-Japanese in amateur sumo though, Watts’ road into the sport came through the professional game.,As with many foreign nationals in pre-internet era Japan, she first encountered sumo on television while waiting for the English-language world news segment, and later got hooked when attending a live tournament.,A keen photographer, Watts had begun taking pictures of sumo when, during a regional tour event, she noticed one , having his topknot styled as another sat alongside playing with a Gameboy. “I thought, ‘Oh that’s such an interesting shot — the traditional and the modern.’”,Her pictures eventually drew the attention of young rikishi, who she discovered all wanted photos of themselves.,One connection led to another, and Watts soon became close with many of the sport’s higher-ranked rikishi and officials.,“I didn’t need the casting couch” she laughs, recalling the time she was quizzed by a well-known sumo journalist about how she had gotten so deep into the sport. “I worked my way into sumo with celluloid — and later my baking skills.”,Watts progressed from friend and photographer to a more formal involvement, and when the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) traveled to the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, they brought the Sydney native along.,In London, she took rikishi and officials shopping and sightseeing, while continuing to photograph proceedings. One photo she took of Kyokudozan with a Beefeater made the back cover of a sumo magazine.,It was a career path that only came about by chance.,“In Australia I was working in high school teaching English and modern languages. I had done two years of Japanese at university, and I introduced it at the school, but the gap between my knowledge of Japanese and that of the students was dwindling, so I took the opportunity to go to Japan — ostensibly just for two years — but after six months I wrote saying, ‘Not coming back.’”,
,
,Watts’ involvement in the foreign tours continued and deepened following the 1991 trip. She accompanied the JSA to France, was the stadium announcer in Canada and helped Akebono make a farewell speech in German in Austria.,When sumo visited her hometown of Sydney, Watts battled with the JSA board to allow , Akebono to end his farewell address with “goodbye Aussies,” which they felt was too informal. She got her way though and was vindicated when it was met with a rousing ovation from the crowd.,One of her more interesting translating jobs came while working with the JSA in Canada. “A radio station from Quebec wanted to interview Musashimaru but they didn’t want him to speak in English.” That resulted in the Hawaii-raised yokozuna using Japanese with Watts and she in turn translating what he said into French.,Despite teaching at Kobe Shoin Women’s University for the entire duration of her 25 year stay in Japan, Watts also found time to work on both the Japanese- and English-language broadcasts for NHK and contribute to various publications.,Her extensive contacts and knowledge of the sport meant it was no surprise when the International Sumo Federation tapped her to help when the World Championship was to be first held outside Japan.,Describing the 1999 tournament in Germany as a “shambles,” Watts recalls how the lack of organization led to the women’s event not having enough countries to be considered a world championship.,“They did all sorts of terrible things. They wanted ring girls in skimpy silky things, they wanted taiko drumming all the way through, and in the program they had (an unauthorized) photo of Konishiki advertising an insurance company.”,
,
,
,That page had to be torn out of every program before the event, which caused further problems as a major Japanese sponsor’s ad was on the reverse.,Despite the rocky start, international amateur sumo has grown and held tournaments around the world over the following two decades.,Whether it’s Poland, Mongolia, Estonia, or Brazil — the Australian veteran has been there.,With an understanding of professional and amateur sumo few can match, and the ability to speak French, German, Japanese and English, Watts is irreplaceable — a fact the sport’s governing body has recognized in making her an IFS director and publicity officer.,Watts also speaks Russian – a language she learned primarily to help with her work in amateur sumo. Many of the sport’s pre-eminent countries have coaches and officials that grew up behind the Iron Curtain.,With the Russian team suddenly out of this summer’s games, and the next World Championships — slated to be held in Moscow — now looking to be at risk, Watts’ particular expertise looks to remain vital in amateur sumo for the foreseeable future.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Contributing writer,Hidetora Hanada, 2020’s amateur yokozuna, made headlines again this week — but not for his exploits inside the sumo ring.,The second-year Nippon Sport Science University student took part in open tryouts for the X League, Japan’s premier American football competition, in Kawasaki on March 6.,
,Despite a complete lack of experience on the gridiron, and needing to buy a helmet and pads just for the combine-style event, Hanada was the star of the show at Fujitsu Stadium.,The tryouts were streamed live, and in offensive line drills the sumo wrestler could be seen dominating opponents that had been playing football for years.,While official results weren’t released, longtime football commentator Hiroaki Shishido reported the former All-Japan champion delivered a 40-yard dash time of 5.23 seconds — an impressive performance for a newcomer working out in front of scouts for the first time.,The Wakayama native’s performance drew audible gasps from coaches in the stands and his outing dominated both newspaper headlines and social media feeds related to the event.,Hanada’s switch of sports didn’t come out of the blue, however.,In a pre-tryout interview on the event’s official website, the NSSU student said he had been watching American football and incorporating elements of its training into his workouts since elementary school.,
,
,Hanada’s favorite NFL player is Aaron Donald — and with a height of 185 cm and weighing in at 135 kg, the gridiron rookie has almost identical measurements to the Los Angeles Rams superstar.,Using the phrase ,, which translates literally as “wielding dual swords” and is often used to describe athletes like Shohei Otani who are adept at two diverse skills, Hanada stated his desire to become both an NFL player and a , in professional sumo.,If he realizes the first dream, he’ll be the first athlete to do so from these shores.,While several Japanese players have made offseason NFL rosters in the past several years and even taken part in preseason action, none to date have survived final cuts or played in a regular-season game.,Hanada turned to one of those who has come closest when preparing for his X League tryout.,Takashi Kurihara, who has spent time in camp with the Baltimore Ravens, helped Hanada refine his sprint technique in the weeks leading up to last weekend’s event.,The impressive results achieved in a limited time means the two will almost certainly work together again if Hanada switches sports. That’s something he now realizes he’ll have to do to have any hope of making the NFL.,Speaking to reporters after the March 6 workout, Hanada revealed he has changed his original plan and decided that it would be better to try and forge a career in football first before taking up sumo later.,
,
,“The life of an NFL player is short and it’s absolutely better to do when younger,” Hanada said. “Wakanohana tried to take up American football after becoming a yokozuna and he said it’s not a sport you can do when older. Terunofuji became yokozuna at 29 so it wouldn’t be too late for me either.”,Even with youth and athletic prowess on his side, making the NFL is a long shot for Hanada.,Competition is fierce in America’s biggest sport and there are far more NFL-level players with top-tier college experience than there are spots available on rosters.,The closest any sumo wrestler has come to professional football remains former , Wakanoho’s brief stint with the University of South Florida’s Division I program.,Six Japanese X League players were drafted into the Canadian Football League last season, however, and that league has a global program that makes Canada a more realistic long-term destination for Hanada.,Even if he doesn’t make it in professional football overseas, Hanada can still experience gridiron at a high level domestically.,Though not widely known, Japan is by far the most dominant power in the global American football scene outside of the United States and Canada.,In the five world championships held to date, only Japan (twice) and the United States (three times) have taken home gold.,At the senior club and international levels, no Japanese team has ever lost a game to a side from outside the U.S. or Canada since football first arrived on these shores in 1934.,The X League is also stacked with Americans that have NFL, CFL and NCAA experience, and Tokyo Dome hosts a championship game that attracts up to 35,000 people each January.,If Hanada were to become yokozuna and then join the X League, he’d be the third grand champion to do so.,The aforementioned Wakanohana spent time at Onward Skylarks after hanging up his , belt, while Wajima was both player and team official at Gakusei-Engokai Rocbull.,Links between the two sports remain strong and in recent years former yokozuna Kisenosato has even been part of the NHK commentary team for the Rice Bowl.,
,
,If Hanada does play football domestically, the nine-time champion Obic Seagulls are the most likely destination.,The Chiba-based outfit was the only team he mentioned playing for in post-workout interviews, and sources inside the organization have indicated there has already been contact between the two sides.,At Obic, Hanada would have a chance to play alongside arguably the greatest football player Japan has ever produced. Wide receiver Noriaki Kinoshita won multiple championships at Ritsumeikan University and was a star in NFL Europe.,Kinoshita helped Amsterdam Admirals to consecutive World Bowl titles in 2005 and 2006 before impressing in time spent with Atlanta Falcons.,If Hanada sticks with football he could have an opportunity to become one of the few homegrown players able to earn a professional contract domestically.,The 20-year-old is star material, and his talent and ability to grab the headlines would be invaluable to a league that often struggles to market itself despite having a high quality product.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Starved of sumo for so long, it’s unlikely fans in Kansai will care whether we see dominance by the yokozuna as usual or a reclaiming of the basho’s stormy reputation.,The Nippon Sport Science University student impressed in a recent X League combine and will attempt to leave his mark on the gridiron before taking on the world of professional sumo.,Watts has been a prominent figure in sumo for over 30 years and since the 1990s has been a mainstay at World Championships, where she undertakes numerous roles.,Jungyō events between major tournaments are not only sources of revenue for the Japan Sumo Association, but also an important means of promoting the sport and recruiting new wrestlers.,Losing the spring tournament would be a huge blow to the sport's birthplace, but the spread of COVID-19 within sumo is making it a possibility.,Retirement ceremonies, ozeki and yokozuna promotions, JSA elections, TV variety show appearances and more all take place between honbasho.,Rather than solely benefiting from good timing and a weakened top division, Mitakeumi is arguably just now fulfilling the potential he has always had.,Often considered de-facto world championship due to their high level of competition, the World Games give young talents a chance to shine ahead of their pro careers.,The Japan Sumo Association's tie-up with the world's biggest video game franchise could be a big step in attracting younger fans to the sport.,Anything other than a third straight championship for the Isegahama stable man at the upcoming January tournament would be a surprise.,

			,Contributing Writer,Manchester United’s “Theatre of Dreams” and the Green Bay Packers’ “Titletown” are two world famous location-based sporting monikers that have been widely derided over the past decade for failing to live up their outlandish descriptions.,Neither, however, comes close to the complete fabrication that the Osaka Spring Basho’s widely used “Stormy ,” nickname has become.,
,Once renowned as the site of upset victories and unpredictable outcomes, the spring meet honor roll has long since turned into merely a list of the sport’s biggest names.,Terunofuji’s title win a year ago, while ranked at ,, made him the first non-, or , to lift the Emperor’s Cup at the March tournament in 21 years, but even in that case, promotion to the latter rank occurred just three days later.,That meet also took place in Tokyo, as COVID-imposed restrictions prevented the Japan Sumo Association from traveling to its normal spring destination. That means the last man outside of sumo’s top two ranks to win the tournament in Osaka remains Takatoriki, who lifted the only Emperor’s Cup of his career in March 2000.,Those looking for historical symmetry are doubtless disappointed by the nightmare finish endured by Takatoriki’s son, Oho, in his top division debut earlier this year.,After a promising start that left him on the cusp of a winning record, newly promoted Oho dropped his final five bouts to end the January meet with seven wins and eight losses.,The 21-year-old was subsequently demoted to the second tier and will miss out on a chance to become the first , ranked title winner in Osaka since his father two decades ago.,Terunofuji, meanwhile, added three more championships over the eight months following his victory last March, and he now returns to sumo’s birthplace a dominant yokozuna seeking to extend Osaka’s wait for a genuine surprise winner.,Whether or not the massive Mongolian will achieve that feat is hard to predict however, as a wave of coronavirus infections hit sumo’s top ranks in early February, and it’s still unclear what condition many if not most of the main title contenders are in.,Kansai may well regain its stormy reputation and see a truly unexpected outcome in 2022, but not for the reason anyone in the sport had wanted.,
,
,COVID-19’s effects are disparate, unpredictable and often lingering, so it won’t be until the action finally gets underway at Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium on Sunday that we have a clear idea about exactly who is in fighting condition.,For now, barring withdrawals, it seems that three men are set to dominate the headlines over the next two weeks.,
,An incredible run of title wins, and runner-up finishes that saw Terunofuji rise from the rank of maegashira to yokozuna in just over a year, finally came to a halt in January.,A late tournament injury prevented the veteran from achieving a historic championship three-peat following promotion to grand champion. But even while clearly out of sorts, Terunofuji took matters down to the final bout of that meet.,If healthy, and that’s a big if, the Ulaanbaatar native is still far and away the best wrestler currently active in sumo.,Even if not at 100% Terunofuji has to be considered the title favorite based on what he has achieved over the past year.,The yokozuna has been pictured training at his stable working out with other , level wrestlers, but precious little video of the sessions has been released, so gauging his stamina levels or how much he is protecting his knees isn’t possible.,With the recent coronavirus outbreak also hampering open practice sessions between top-rankers that have been a feature of recent years, there is also no way to judge Terunofuji’s current level against that of the men who figure be his main title rivals in Osaka.,There have of course been video conference-calls with the media by many high-profile wrestlers since the last tournament ended, but as is the case in every sport, actual insight about health and physical condition that could give a competitive advantage to opponents if made public isn’t on any athlete’s agenda.,
,Sumo’s most recent ozeki is also the ,With a third Emperor’s Cup under his belt and promotion to the sport’s second highest rank achieved, it would appear Mitakeumi has managed to extract maximum value from his undoubted sumo abilities.,Even the Nagano native’s more ardent supporters have long recognized that achieving the ultimate honor of yokozuna promotion requires a kind of consistency that Mitakeumi has never come close to displaying.,
,
,An 11-4 outing in November followed by a 13-2 title run in January is the best back-to-back tournament performance in Mitakeumi’s career to date.,While a 13-2 record is probably good enough to put a , in the title hunt in most tournaments, it’s still on the lower end of the scale when it comes to assessing what should be considered a title “equivalent” performance for yokozuna promotion.,If the Dewanoumi stable man hopes to take advantage of sumo’s current weakened state and make a run for the white rope, he’ll need to kick on and elevate his sumo to a level and consistency previously unseen.,Additional Emperor’s Cups aren’t out of the question, and Mitakeumi could even emerge victorious again in Osaka. That would be a surprise, however, and the smart money is probably on more up and down performances from the 29-year-old.,
,Regardless of whether or not you buy the narrative of Abi’s redemption and turn away from the dark side, there is no questioning the impact he has had on the top division since returning from a JSA imposed suspension for breaking COVID-19 protocols.,Back-to-back 12-3 runner-up performances that included wins over both Terunofuji and ozeki Takakeisho injected excitement into proceedings and have earned the Shikoroyama stable man promotion to sumo’s third highest rank of sekiwake for the first time.,But his new position will mean a much tougher slate of matches straight out of the gate and should quickly show whether or not Abi has what it takes to survive and thrive at the sharp end of the ,.,At 27, the Saitama native is at the age when many sumo wrestlers reach their peak. With the top two rikishi in the sport bedeviled by injury, and the next generation of rising stars not quite there yet, Abi has a window in which to create a storybook final act for a career that he seemed to have thrown away just two years ago.,
,Outside of the three rikishi discussed above, Takakeisho still bears watching the most.,The ozeki is , for March, which means that unless he manages eight wins, he’ll lose that rank for the second time since getting promoted in 2019.,Like Terunofuji, health is the determining factor for Takakeisho’s place in the pecking order. If fully fit, he is behind only the yokozuna when it comes to title favorites.,
,
,The 25-year-old’s pushing-thrusting style of sumo means that we’ll know within the first couple of days what shape he is in. When firing on all cylinders, Takakeisho overwhelms virtually all opponents, but when out of sorts, he struggles against even lower-level wrestlers.,In terms of a first surprise title winner in Osaka since Takatoriki, most people will be looking to fast-rising Hoshoryu to mount a challenge.,The 22-year-old Mongolian is an exciting prospect, and his famous yokozuna uncle (Asashoryu) ensures plenty of column inches, headlines and guest spots on variety shows.,Hoshoryu has a bright future ahead of him, but it may well be a veteran like , Takanosho that grabs the glory in Osaka this time out.,For good or bad, illness and injury have made the upcoming tournament arguably the hardest to predict in years, and there are arguments to be made for at least half a dozen other rikishi being in position to lift silverware at the end of the fortnight’s action.,One major positive, however, is the fact that not only will sumo return to Osaka for the first time since 2020, but fans will be allowed in to watch the action in person. That’s something that ,Starved of sumo for so long, it’s unlikely fans in Kansai will care whether we see dominance by the yokozuna as usual or a reclaiming of the basho’s stormy reputation.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Lone , Terunofuji easily took care of business against rising talent Hoshoryu at the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday, while Mitakeumi made a winning start to his , career., Hoshoryu was making his debut among the three , ranks below yokozuna on the opening day of the 15-day meet at Edion Arena Osaka, where spectators are witnessing the action for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.,
,Having lost all three of their previous meetings, the 22-year-old nephew of Mongolian great Asashoryu once again failed to find a winning formula against Terunofuji, who gained a grip at the jump and immediately forced him out.,The 30-year-old grand champion, who fell short in his bid for a third straight title at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, will fight No. 1 , Daieisho on Day 2.,Three-time grand tournament winner Mitakeumi, who lifted the Emperor’s Cup in January, debuted at sumo’s second-highest rank against towering Mongolian-born No. 2 Ichinojo.,The new ozeki stayed composed after being driven back by his 190-centimeter, 206-kilogram opponent, keeping his distance until seizing an opening to push Ichinojo over the straw bales.,Ozeki Takakeisho showed no sign of the right ankle injury that forced him out of the New Year meet, exploding out of the blocks in a pushout victory over wily No. 1 Ura.,Fighting as a demotion-threatened , ozeki, Takakeisho blasted through Ura’s defense to earn the first of the eight wins he needs to keep his rank.,Fellow kadoban ozeki Shodai looked anything but convincing, however, offering little resistance in a pushout loss to No. 1 Daieisho. Former , Daieisho flew off the mark and quickly bundled the hapless ozeki out.,“I think the fans in Osaka here are making the tournament exciting,” Daieisho said. “There are a lot of new faces at the top of the rankings, and that’s motivating me as well.”,Fighting at a career-high ranking of sekiwake after challenging for the title in January, Abi was pushed out by fellow former komusubi and current No. 3 Onosho.,Unable to budge Onosho with his trademark thrusting attack, Abi left himself open to the pushout when he unsuccessfully tried to pull his opponent off balance.,The 27-year-old Abi has surged up the rankings since returning from a half-year suspension for breaking sumo’s coronavirus safety rules in July 2020.,Wakatakakage, bumped up from No. 1 to sekiwake after going 9-6 in January, won his first bout at sumo’s third-highest rank against battle-hardened Mongolian No. 2 Tamawashi.,After absorbing a strong opening hit from Tamawashi, Wakatakakage showed quick reflexes in stepping to the side and thrusting the maegashira to the clay.,Komusubi Takanosho’s tournament got off to an anticlimactic start, gifting a win to No. 3 Meisei by losing his footing at the jump and slipping to the clay.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Japanese authorities ordered crypto exchanges on Monday not to process transactions involving crypto assets subject to asset-freeze sanctions against Russia and Belarus over the war in Ukraine.,The step was taken after a Group of Seven statement on Friday that said Western nations ""will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth."",
,There are growing concerns among the G7 advanced economies that cryptocurrencies are being used by Russian entities as a loophole for financial sanctions imposed upon the country for invading Ukraine.,The U.S. Treasury Department issued new guidance Friday that required U.S.-based cryptocurrency firms not to engage in transactions with sanction targets.,""We decided to make an announcement to keep the G7 momentum alive,"" said a senior official at Japan's Financial Services Agency. ""The sooner the better."",The government will work as one to strengthen measures against the transfer of funds using crypto assets that would be in violation of the sanctions, the FSA and Finance Ministry said in a joint statement.,Japan has lagged a global shift among financial regulators in setting stricter rules on private digital currencies, while the G7 rich powers and the Group of 20 powerhouses have all called for greater regulation of ""stablecoins."",Unauthorized payments to targets under sanctions, including through crypto assets, are subject to punishment of up to three years in prison or a ¥1 million fine, the FSA said on Monday.,There were 31 crypto exchanges in Japan as of March 4, according to an industry association.,Global regulators remain concerned about the safety of the new market for investors, given its surge in popularity.

			,Bloomberg,Atlassian Corp. co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest have committed more cash to a $30 billion Australian dollars ($21.9 billion) project to export solar power from Australia’s Northern Territory to Singapore via an undersea cable.,Sun Cable Pty Ltd. completed a AU$210 million Series B capital raising with existing shareholders to accelerate the progress of the Australia-Asia PowerLink, as well as other projects in its portfolio, the company said in a statement Monday. The raising was led by Cannon-Brookes’ investment group Grok Ventures and Forrest’s Squadron Energy.,
,Sun Cable plans to lay a 4,200-kilometer (2,600-mile) high-voltage cable to supply enough electricity to meet 15% of Singapore’s demand from a giant solar and battery complex deep in the Outback. The project will also supply the northern Australian city of Darwin when it starts operating in 2027.,“This brings Australia one step closer to realizing our renewables exporting potential,” Cannon-Brookes said in a statement. “We can power the world with clean energy and Sun Cable is harnessing that at scale.”,
,
,Cannon-Brookes has been a vocal campaigner for the clean energy transition in Australia, which still gets around 60% of its power from coal, teaming up with investment giant Brookfield last month in a failed bid for generation company AGL Energy Ltd. The partners had planned to accelerate the closure of AGL’s coal-fired plants and replace them with renewables.,Forrest is looking to transform his iron-ore empire into a major clean energy producer over the next decade, and has been scouring the planet for opportunities to invest in renewables and green hydrogen projects.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO, staff report,Amid the graying of Japan’s population, an increasing number of companies are offering job opportunities to people age 70 and older after a revised law on hiring older workers took effect last year.,While the law stipulates that companies need to make efforts to ensure workers up to the age of 70 have job opportunities, many companies are hoping to utilize older workers as valuable assets beyond what is laid out in the legislation.,
,Companies need to be careful when employing older people, for example by making sure to prevent work-related accidents. But what is notable with the current trend is that firms are being flexible — not only employing workers over the age of 80, but also allowing them to have side jobs.,The number of companies with a system that enables the employment of people age 70 and over topped 50,000 in 2020. At present, around 675,000 people age 70 or over are working, a figure that has more than doubled over the past four years.,Electronics retailer Nojima Co. is one of the companies employing people in that age range. In July 2020, it changed its policy on how long it will in principle extend employment for staffers after the retirement age of 65, raising it to the age of 80, and from last year it effectively abolished its age limit to allow older workers to continue working on a case-by-case basis — the company allows for further extensions if the employee has no health problems.,As of the end of January, 25 people over the age of 70 were working at Nojima, thereby making use of their previous experience.,Emiko Kumagai, 80, who works at a Nojima outlet in Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture, is the first person to work at the company who is that age or older.,Kumagai had been working part-time at another major retailer, but that store closed, and when Nojima opened an outlet at the same location in June 2009, she was hired as a part-timer, even though she was already close to 70.,“We have been hiring experienced workers since the company was founded. So there was already a basis for people working regardless of their age,” said Masakazu Toyama, manager of Nojima’s human resources department.,Kumagai commutes to work on a motorcycle and works four days a week from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Younger employees call her “Grandma” and often seek her out for advice on personal issues, while customers Kumagai’s age rely on her knowledge of home appliances.,“Older customers tend to avoid asking young employees about smartphones and computers,” noted Toyama. “Meanwhile, senior employees can tend to them by reflecting on their own experiences.”,The income allows Kumagai to lead her life without having to tighten her purse strings.,“It’s nice to be able to replace flowers in the garden each season with the salary I get,” she added.,Tokyu Community Corp., a Tokyo-based firm that maintains apartment complexes and other buildings, employs its senior workers as contract workers and part-timers until they reach the age of 77. As of March 2021, nearly half of its 11,322 employees were 65 or older and 2,320 were age 70 or older.,Many of those who apply to Tokyu Community to be maintenance staff for apartment complexes have retired from companies in other industries. The company has an extensive training program and offers a reward of ¥5,000 or more for acquiring real estate-related qualifications. The company also allows those who work shorter hours, and earn a lower income, to have a side job, provided they are not in the same industry.,Safety considerations are also essential, as much of the work is physically demanding. Tokyu Community lends safety shoes to employees and shares information on hazardous situations that workers experienced each month with others. The company also encourages healthy activities, for example by giving employees points that can be used for welfare benefits when they participate in a marathon.,“Health management is an important task in the employment of seniors,” Hiroyuki Ikeda, head of the company’s human resources division, stressed.,As Japan’s birthrate declines and society ages, companies are likely to face a shortage of labor, says Yasuko Matoba, chief researcher at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.,“The physical strength and health of the elderly varies greatly from person to person, and companies will need to monitor individual cases to see whether there are any concerns about their style of working,” she said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bloomberg,The world is getting warmer and, for billions of people, more dangerous. For the No. 1 air-conditioning maker, Japan’s Daikin Industries Ltd., that’s a huge opportunity.,Global demand for air conditioning is on track to triple through 2050, according to the International Energy Agency. And with household incomes climbing in developing economies, it’s a good time to be in the business of cool air.,
,At the same time, air conditioners gobble up electricity and run on atmosphere-harming refrigerants, making them part of the problem — for now. Daikin has pledged to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, a goal shared by the Japanese government. To make that happen, Daikin Chief Executive Officer Masanori Togawa is pouring billions of dollars into research and development, looking to build on technological breakthroughs that could make its machines more efficient.,Long term, Daikin’s investors have backed his approach. In his eight years as CEO, the stock has more than tripled, far outpacing Japan’s Topix Index. The pandemic, of course, wrought havoc on supply chains, and the air-conditioning maker wasn’t spared. Last month, the company’s quarterly profit report fell short of projections, triggering a 7.3% drop in the share price. Togawa said that Daikin has secured chip supplies through the coming year. Securing those components put the company back on target again, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Chen.,Bloomberg Green spoke with Togawa, 73, recently about how Daikin is bracing for the risks and opportunities ahead.,It’s absolutely necessary for peoples’ lives. When it’s hot you need cooling, and when it’s cold, you need heating. Humidification and dehumidification are also necessary. Without air conditioning, productivity at offices and factories goes down. That means air-conditioning is necessary for economic activity.,It’s not realistic to try and have a world with zero air conditioning. Unthinkable. What’s really changed is the push to reduce carbon. So the question is how we can address environmental issues. We have to think about how the shift to carbon neutrality is actually an opportunity for us to grow our business.,Our goals of reaching a 30% reduction in carbon emissions in 2025 and at least 50% in 2030 are based on our best understanding of what we can achieve. The issue is 2050. In order to reach carbon neutrality by then, we’ll need a whole other level of innovation and technological advancements. Without that, it will be impossible.,The IEA predicts that air conditioning demand will triple by 2050 — this also means demand for electricity will triple. Meeting those needs with current technology is impossible. We’re working with universities and researchers, while investing in order to come up with new, innovative technology.,
,
,One good example is magnetic refrigeration. It’s possible to generate heat or cold using plus and minus magnetic fields. Right now this is feasible for small spaces; the issue is whether we can do this for larger spaces and at lower costs. A key topic for us right now is whether this is even practical or not.,We’re doing joint research on magnetocaloric materials, which is very important. These are the things we need to work on in order to reach carbon neutrality in 2050.,We have more technology than people realize. That includes inverters, heat pumps and low GWP (global warming potential) refrigerants. We have to build on top of these.,Take, for example, inverters. In Japan, almost all our products have inverters, but in China the ratio is still about 60%. When you get to Southeast Asia there are hardly any inverters. That’s the case with Africa as well. The reason why is cost. So what we’re focusing on is shifting to inverters at a much lower cost.,If you look across the world, burning fuel such as gas or oil for heating is predominant. Even in heavily regulated Europe, the use of heat pumps, which have a smaller environmental impact compared to burning fuel, the uptake is only a bit more than 10%. By 2030, burning fuel for heating will no longer be possible in Europe. If we build products that get us closer to 100%, the impact of this will be huge. After inverters, heat pumps will help set apart our products.,We may have to consider them, if necessary.,The most widely used refrigerant right now is R-410A. It has a GWP of about 2000. The refrigerant that we are trying to spread across the world, and releasing the patents on, is R-32, which has a GWP of about 700.,We’re trying to promote the use of air conditioners that use R-32. Replacing R-410A will also have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions. Collecting refrigerants, reusing and disposal of refrigerants, that will also help.,
,
,This is obvious, but people want to live safely and healthily. The value of that is appreciated even more now. We are thinking hard about how we can contribute to that. Of course there’s heating, cooling, humidification, dehumidification, as well as ventilating, purifying and disinfecting air.,In Japan, people are spending about 40% more time at home. They may want to make it more comfortable, perhaps rebuild, and seek out more comfortable air conditioning. So how can we provide the right air conditioning for this? Customer needs are changing, so how can we capture this and respond with the right products?,Semiconductor supplies are very constrained right now, and prices are well above where they usually are. Supplies for semiconductors and electric parts will be low until autumn of this year. Of course costs will rise. But it’s not just about passing on costs but delivering products and services that will justify the price increases.,We’ve already secured the chips that we’ll need for fiscal 2022 (ending March 2023).,Well, when you consider the value of air conditioning for people, you’ll need more biometrics. For example, what temperature, humidity, air flow is the best for a person’ health?,For example, Kyoto University has been collecting biometric data from a city in Nagahama from about 10,000 people for about 10 years. You can look into the conditions that they live in, the air-conditioning environment and what kind of ventilation. You can monitor their health. Using this data, you can create the healthiest air conditioning for optimal health, so the question is how we can implement this.,I don’t think we can grow our business without offering something that contributes to society. I don’t think you can maintain a business by just growing revenue. I think air conditioning is a business that can contribute to society.,I tend to find things chilly; I’m thin and don’t have enough muscle! But we’re based in Osaka, which is brutally hot during the summer. There’s no way we can survive there without air conditioning.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Reuters,Where you go. What you pass. Where you stop. What you listen to. What you watch. Your good habits. Your bad habits.,Companies in Europe and beyond are vying for control of the crown jewels of the connected car era: your vehicle’s data.,
,The contest is entering a pivotal phase as EU regulators look to hammer out the world’s first laws for the ballooning industry around web-enabled vehicles, pitting carmakers against a coalition of insurers, leasing companies and repair shops.,European Commission sources said the EU executives should launch an industry consultation on in-vehicle data this week which could lead to legislation later this year — the first of its kind globally.,Many companies view data as the gold of the new wired world, though for some it’s more akin to air or water.,“If you don’t have access to data in the future, eventually you’ll be squeezed out,” says Tim Albertsen, CEO of ALD, Societe Generale’s car leasing division, which commands millions of vehicles.,“You’ll not be efficient, you’ll not have the right services, you just can’t operate at the end of the day.”,Car manufacturers, guarding their gatekeeper role in accessing data from their vehicles, have resisted specific regulations for in-vehicle data, saying that protecting consumers is paramount.,“Europe’s auto industry is committed to giving access to the data generated by the vehicles it produces,” said a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). “However, uncontrolled access to in-vehicle data poses major safety, (cyber) security, data protection and privacy threats.”,Yet the companies lined up against them say limiting or charging what they deem unfair amounts for access to in-vehicle data could kill off competition for carmakers who already operate their own leasing firms, car subscription services and repair shops.,In some cases, they say carmakers are already restricting access to vehicle data and charging independent repair shops more for access.,“The manufacturers are in direct contact with the vehicle, so they get all the data,” says Sylvia Gotzen, CEO of the International Federation of Automotive Aftermarket Distributors, or FIGIEFA, which is part of a broader alliance of repair shops and parts makers that employs 3.5 million people in Europe.,“They get the full buffet and all we get is some crumbs.”,
,Vehicle manufacturers have big plans for data.,For example Stellantis, the world’s No. 4 carmaker, expects to generate €20 billion ($22.4 billion) annually by 2030 from software products and subscription services. Such offerings are also central to General Motors’ plan to double annual revenue to around $280 billion.,Volkswagen said data is becoming the “key source of value creation and innovation,” adding that customers have “full control” over it, citing vehicle security and customer sovereignty as its main focuses.,BMW rejected suggestions it was withholding data.,
,
,The German company said it can share nearly 100 data points with third parties if drivers requested it and could make more available if companies prove a real business need for them and a willingness to take responsibility for cybersecurity risks. Auto supplier groups like FIGIEFA say carmakers can access thousands of data points.,A BMW spokesperson said the carmaker would like all sides to sit down with a mediator such as the European Commission and hammer out a list of data points that is acceptable to everyone.,Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters on Friday that the carmaker aggregated data, which cost money, and so needed to be paid for it. He cited, as an example, data that Stellantis sells to cities to measure how often anti-lock braking systems are engaged at junctions and gauge which are the most dangerous.,“It is not only collecting the data, it is also about crunching the data in a way that is going to create value for somebody willing to pay for it,” Tavares said.,
,Yet other companies in the auto ecosystem, such as ALD, say they want the European Union to ensure a level playing field,ALD, in the process of buying Dutch rival LeasePlan to give it a combined fleet of 3.5 million vehicles, has a car-sharing platform that needs to run diagnostics, read the odometer, check the fuel gauge and switch cars between users.,It also offers an insurance product that lowers your premium based on good driving behavior — monitoring how you accelerate and brake.,“Access to data is absolutely key for us to provide the services we do today,” CEO Albertsen said.,To extract car data, ALD plugs a wireless “dongle” into the vehicle that transmits information to an in-house developed platform that it pays U.S. startup Vinli to operate. Carmakers running similar services get that data directly, putting ALD at a competitive disadvantage, Albertsen said.,Stellantis, for instance, offers car sharing and rentals through its Free2Move unit. Volkswagen could take over rental company Europcar to take advantage of car sharing and subscription services.,And most major carmakers have their own leasing units, like BMW’s Alphabet and Mercedes-Benz’s Athlon.,ALD’s Albertsen said major fleet customers were willing to pay for the data but that he wanted regulations to ensure ALD’s car-sharing unit paid the same as, for instance, Stellantis charges its own Free2Move division.,
,Insurers and car repair shops say it is paramount that the EU let drivers choose who accesses their vehicles’ data.,“There is a need to regulate this, as you cannot leave this in the hands of car manufacturers,” said Nicolas Jeanmart, industry group Insurance Europe’s head of personal and general insurance. “It should be for each driver to decide what they want to do with their data.”,FIGIEFA’s Gotzen said that would allow car owners to link their preferred repair shop to their car and have it run remote diagnostics if they had car trouble, instead of relying solely on the manufacturer’s recommendations.,“All of this is technically possible now, but we are hampered because car manufacturers prevent us from doing this,” she said.,She said FIGIEFA’s members are willing to adopt carmakers’ cybersecurity processes and requirements, but added cybersecurity could serve as an excuse for carmakers to restrict access.,Richard Knubben, deputy director general of Leaseurope, which represents Europe’s leasing and car rental firms, said the longer the EU took to legislate car data, the more independent repair shops are at risk of going out of business because they lack access to it.,“By the time we get legislation we may already be stuck with an imbalance that we can’t fix anymore,” Knubben said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Bloomberg,Widespread lockdowns in China akin to the measures just taken in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen could affect half of the country’s gross domestic product.,Authorities on Sunday placed Shenzhen’s 17.5 million residents into lockdown for at least a week amid a surge in COVID-19 infections in the city, an action that Bloomberg Economics said will deal a “direct hit” to Guangdong province, which accounts for 11% of GDP.,
,As cases jump elsewhere, half of China’s GDP and population will be impacted by the latest outbreak, according to economists at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,“Previous steps to contain virus flareups left manufacturing unscathed for the most part,” Bloomberg Economics’ Chang Shu and David Qu wrote in a note Monday. The lockdown in Shenzhen will hit output in industries such as tech and machinery, which feed into global supply chains, they said.,“The double hit to consumption and output, plus spillovers beyond China raise the stakes in this lockdown,” the economists added.,The Shenzhen move comes as other parts of China try to battle the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Shanghai has suspended in-person classes and shut intercity bus services, while the northeast industrial center of Changchun in Jilin province — a city of about 9 million people and accounting for about 11% of China’s total annual car output in 2020 — was locked down last week.,“More cities may follow the practice of Shenzhen,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at ANZ, in a note Monday, noting the city’s decision to shut down public transportation and prevent people from leaving or entering. “If the lockdown is extended, China’s economic growth will be significantly affected.”,While Yeung said ANZ is not yet revising its forecast for 2022, they are “wary” of further restrictions. ANZ forecasts GDP growth of 5% for the year, less than the government’s target of about 5.5%.,
,
,Should key provinces along the coast and in the northeast follow Shenzhen’s lead and lock down for a week, the economic cost could amount to 0.8 of a percentage point of GDP growth, Yeung said.,Nomura Holdings Inc. said the economic costs of China’s “COVID zero” approach are high and market participants may be too optimistic about this year’s growth outlook. The bank expects GDP expansion of 4.3%, well below economists’ consensus forecast of 5.2%.,China is facing rapidly spreading clusters spawned by the highly infectious omicron variant. Daily new cases jumped to more than 3,300 on Saturday from just over 300 a week ago. The surge poses an unprecedented challenge to the country’s COVID zero strategy, which has so far protected its vast industrial sector but dampened consumption.,
,Shenzhen is home to the headquarters of tech giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co.,Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn, the Taiwanese company also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has its China headquarters in the area. The company has halted operations in Shenzhen, including at a site that produces iPhones, in response to the lockdown.,Major financial companies, including Ping An Insurance Group Co. and China Merchants Bank Co. are also headquartered in the city. And several foreign banks such as UBS Group AG and HSBC Holding have opened branches in the area.,Brokerages and big state banks in the city have suspended in-person services after the lockdown, according to notices and local media reports.,Shenzhen is the second-most important port in China after Shanghai and processes about 10% of the containers shipped from China in any month. A part of the port was shut for weeks in mid-2021 to contain a local outbreak of COVID-19, but even then the port was able to ship out almost 2 million containers in June 2021.,Yantian port said in a Monday statement that it is operating normally after Shenzhen tightened virus controls.,Guangdong’s $795 billion worth of exports in 2021 accounted for 23% of China’s shipments that year, the most of any province, according to Bloomberg Economics. Shenzhen alone had exports of $303 billion.,“Even if the lockdown is in place for only a short period — our baseline case — the impact will likely last for a few weeks longer due to likely disruptions to supply in the city and the reverberations beyond,” the economists said.,While COVID zero has not led to major economic disruption so far, the restrictions are making the economy “particularly vulnerable to the more contagious omicron variant,” said Louis Kuijs, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings.,“Globally, the economic impact of COVID is declining as governments ease restrictions and many move towards a ‘living with COVID’ approach,” Kuijs added. “However, for China, omicron is a key risk for domestic demand, output and, possibly, supply chains.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,Japanese para snowboarder Junta Kosuda said the loss of his leg turned out to be a blessing in the long run.,“(The story of) losing one leg has become my strongest asset,” said Kosuda, who was drifting through life until finding purpose and focus in para sports.,
,A drowsy driving accident set Kosuda on the path that led him to the Beijing Winter Paralympics. It was his first encounter with para long jump star Atsushi Yamamoto that inspired him to become an elite competitor.,Kosuda finished seventh in the men’s snowboard cross SB-LL1 category earlier this week, after failing to qualify for Monday’s small and big finals.,The LL1 class, among other things, includes athletes with above-the-knee amputations.,The 31-year-old took a tumble in training before the competition and had to compete with a twisted left ankle and a swollen left eye.,He is hoping for better luck in Friday’s banked slalom event, where he is targeting a medal.,Kosuda had to have his right leg amputated when he was 21. Driving for a moving company, he was responsible for the crash that led to his injury.,Until he was involved in the accident, Kosuda said he was “living life without purpose,” having quit soccer, a sport he began playing in elementary school, and then dropping out of college.,The turning point came in the summer of 2015, when he took part in an athletics class for prosthetics users. Yamamoto was serving as the instructor.,“He was so cool. I wanted to be like him,” Kosuda said.,That fall, the three-time Paralympic medalist in long jump, known for his trademark sunglasses, shaved head and bladed leg prosthesis, encouraged Kosuda to try a prosthetic device and take up athletics.,The following year, Kosuda changed jobs to give him better opportunities to train. Yamamoto, who competed in snowboarding at the Pyeongchang Winter Paralympics, was also the reason he started snowboarding.,“I have no chance against him in athletics but I felt like I could beat him in snowboarding,” Kosuda joked.,Yamamoto remembers how Kosuda was unmotivated and unproductive when they first met. But he was there to see his protege breaking his bad habits to turn his life around.,Kosuda failed on his way to success, but Yamamoto thinks that is what makes his story very human and relatable.,“Now he has become a great role model of someone who can turn a disability into possibility,” Yamamoto said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Dutch Paralympian Jeroen Kampschreur swears by his Japanese-made sit-ski, a trusty companion that helped him score his country’s first Paralympic medal of any type in Alpine skiing at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.,The 22-year-old, who has so far also taken home one silver in the men’s sitting super combined at the Beijing Games, has used a sit-ski manufactured by Nissin Medical Industries Co. since he began competitive skiing at the age of 14.,
,“Nissin has been really good to me, and yes, I have tried another brand,” he said at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Center. “But I was like, yes, I am going well now, so I don’t want to give up my winning strategy.”,Kampschreur was born without shinbones due to a limb deficiency, resulting in the amputation of both legs above the knee. He won gold in the men’s sitting super combined at his maiden Paralympic Games in 2018, and also became the first Dutch para Alpine skier to win a world title.,Kampschreur said that he prefers sit-skis made by Nissin over leading French maker Tessier’s as they are “more playful.”,“The other sit-skis, they steer you more and this one I have more control over, so it works well for parts that are a little harder or a little more steep,” he said.,Sit-skis, also called chair-skis in Japan, consist of a molded seat mounted onto a metal chassis, an adjustable shock absorber as well as a conventional ski binding and a ski. A custom-made model with a seat tailored to the specific body shape of an athlete can cost tens of thousands of dollars.,Han Sang Min, a Korean sit skier who claimed his country’s first medal in para Alpine skiing when he won silver at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, is another world-class athlete that has stuck to Nissin for many years.,“(Nissin) sponsored my wheelchair for daily life and basketball, so I naturally used their sit-skis as well,” he said, adding that he wanted to support a brand from an Asian country.,Han, whose impairment is a result of contracting polio at the age of 1, also won gold for South Korea in wheelchair basketball at the 2014 Asian Para Games in Incheon.,
,
,In Japan, the development of sit-skis began in the late 1970s and was first commercialized in 1980. Nissin, which is one of the largest manufacturers of wheelchairs in Japan, released its first sit-ski for Japanese Paralympians in time for the 1998 Nagano Games.,One of three categories in para Alpine skiing, along with standing and visually impaired, sit skiing is a discipline that has given Japan a gold medal in each of the past four Paralympics, with Beijing continuing that trend.,To keep the country’s Paralympic gold run going, multiple Japanese companies have worked together to develop better sit skis for their athletes.,In 2015, Toyota Motor Corp. began collaborating with Nissin’s sit-ski development team following a proposal by para Alpine all-rounder and multi-medalist Taiki Morii, who had joined the major automaker a year earlier.,Morii, who has claimed two bronze medals so far in Beijing, has since been involved in developing sit-skis that minimize air resistance through wind tunnel testing and other means.,By using state-of-the-art computer analysis software developed by Toyota, Nissin was able to create the “Hayabusa” in time for the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. The improved model was 15% lighter, with the chassis three times more rigid than conventional models.,As athletes can reach speeds exceeding 100 kilometers per hour in events like the downhill, a shell covering the lower part of the athlete’s body was also added for improved aerodynamic performance.,Nissin’s sit-ski has further evolved into the “Hayabusa 2” for Beijing, with Morii and Alpine star Momoka Muraoka using the latest model.,“(Alpine skiing) is the fastest sport in the Paralympics. We want people to pay attention to their gear like in motorsports,” Morii said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,KYODO,Alpine sit-skier Momoka Muraoka missed out on winning her fifth medal of the Beijing Paralympics on Saturday when she finished fifth in the women’s slalom.,The 25-year-old Japanese was attempting to win five medals at consecutive Paralympic Games, but was unable to add to her haul of three gold and one silver won at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Center in Beijing’s mountainous north.,
,Muraoka could not replicate her dominant showings from the speed events in the technical tight turns of the slalom, which she acknowledged before the event is her least preferred discipline.,She completed her first run in the fifth-fastest time of 53.44 seconds and improved in her second to complete the course in 52.10, but her 1-minute, 45.54-second total time was not good enough to put her into medal contention.,Anna-Lena Forster of Germany defended her slalom title with a two-run time of 1:37.86 to finish ahead of Chinese pair Zhang Wenjing and Liu Sitong.,It was Forster’s second gold and fourth medal overall in Beijing, taking her career total to nine won across three games.,While Muraoka was unable to replicate the five medals she won at the Pyeongchang Games in 2018, she did make history by becoming the first Japanese Winter Paralympian to win four career gold medals while equaling the Japan record for the most golds won at a single games.,Fellow Japanese Yoshiko Tanaka finished the sitting slalom event ranked sixth and Norika Harada eighth. Neither woman won a medal in China.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,AFP-Jiji,China has emerged as a new Winter Paralympics powerhouse at their own Beijing Games, topping the medals table in a stunning success backed by huge investment and aided by the absence of Russian athletes.,The hosts on Sunday finished proudly top of the table with 18 golds and 61 medals in all — a remarkable rise given that they only made their Winter Paralympics debut in 2002 and it was not until Pyeongchang, four years ago, that the country won its first medal, a gold in wheelchair curling.,
,“The Games have given people with impairments a lot of confidence,” gold medal cross-country skier Mao Zhongwu said.,China’s Paralympics success story, say long-time Games observers, is one of money, foreign coaches, the absence of Russian athletes, hard work and — perhaps — home-country advantage.,Recruiting talent such as Russian para ice hockey coach Nikolay Sharshukov and Italian alpine ski coach Dario Capelli helped generate medal contenders.,Capelli said had to go back to basics to turn a squad of beginners into champions.,“For these athletes, every day for 11 months, it was ski training, ski training … I don’t know which other country can do this,” he said.,“On the first day, we did a test with them, on a slope where they had to make five turns. We realized that they were all beginners.”,China’s General Administration of Sports had a budget of $1 billion in 2021 and a significant amount was channeled into winter sports, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.,The think tank noted that strong Summer Games performer Australia had a sports budget of $124 million, while American athletes were entirely privately funded.,“The Chinese mentality is: When they want something, they want the top. They invest a lot of money. That is very important,” Capelli said.,Loughborough University sports psychology researcher Sara Svoboda said China’s success may be reflective of strong campaign planning and using psychological strategies derived from the military.,“Their strong showing may be the result of aligning a vision and mission across the entire Paralympic squad, including support staff, which helps to mobilize efforts and create an overarching vision driving their team forward,” she said.,Small crowds of hand-picked domestic spectators have been going wild for Chinese victories — dancing to pop music and waving flags.,At the para snowboarding cross finals, China made a clean sweep of the men’s upper limb category medals.,The ecstatic trio — Ji Lijia, Wang Pengyao and Zhu Yonggang — wore their country’s flag like capes as they celebrated.,Cliff Mallett, a former elite Australian athletics coach and now University of Queensland academic, said home advantage could spur some athletes to greater heights, but for others it can increase stress.,“In Chinese society, I assume competing at home would be advantageous because of the pride the Chinese have in representing their country in front of their relatives, friends, and villages; their social identity is very strong,” he said.,“But everyone will be different. I assume that some will feel that pressure and subsequently underperform.”,The absence of powerful Russian athletes — who were banned from the games following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine — also cleared a path for more Chinese success.,Competing as neutrals four years ago in Pyeongchang, Russian athletes won eight gold, 10 silver and nine bronze medals.,The International Paralympics Committee (IPC) originally ruled that athletes from Russia and ally Belarus would be allowed to compete as neutrals, but 24 hours later banned the two countries after threats of boycotts and tension in the athletes’ village.,IPC President Andrew Parsons acknowledged the impact of the Russian absence.,“Of course some of them are very strong athletes and this has in some way affected the depth of field in some events,” he said.,The scale of China’s success in Beijing even took some of their own athletes by surprise.,“We weren’t really aware of our level before these Paralympic Games,” said Liu Sitong, 27, who won two bronze and one silver medal in women’s sitting alpine skiing, “because we haven’t been competing abroad much lately.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,With the Beijing Winter Games ending Sunday, Japan will turn its attention to discovering young athletes with disabilities who have the potential to become future Paralympic medalists.,But Japan is grappling with challenges in the talent identification process as it looks to help young athletes with impairments find a path into sports and then onwards to the Paralympic podium.,
,Lack of accessibility in sports facilities and infrastructure limits the involvement of individuals with disabilities in sports, making it tough for athletes to find a safe and supporting environment to jump-start their sporting careers at an early age.,If gyms and swimming pools that are friendly to the impaired are hard to find in Japan, finding snow and ice sport programs for people with a range of disabilities and mobility issues that offer adaptive equipment, qualified instruction and competition can be even harder.,While sport can be an important vehicle for the disabled to gain a foothold in their community, it requires a high level of commitment from all concerned to deliver the ultimate success.,“It’s very difficult to identify and develop athletic talent. Athletes and their parents need to be fully committed,” said Kuniko Obinata, a representative of the Japan Para-Ski Federation.,The Tokyo Summer Paralympics featured 4,400 athletes who competed in 537 medal events, compared with 564 athletes and 78 medal events at the Beijing Winter Paralympics.,The youngest of the three Japanese to win a medal in Beijing was 21-year-old cross-country skier Taiki Kawayoke. The others went to 25-year-old Momoka Muraoka and 41-year-old Taiki Morii, both Alpine sit-skiers.,Countries that are dedicating more resources to support disability sports are reaping the benefits.,Alpine skiers Alexandra Rexova of Slovakia, who struck gold in the women’s super-G vision impaired, and Johannes Aigner of Austria, who captured five medals in the vision impaired class, including two gold, are both 16 years old.,China, Germany and Great Britain also had gold medalists under the age of 20.,International Paralympic Committee spokesperson Craig Spence said at the IPC’s news conference on Thursday that young athletes have stolen the show in both Paralympics in Beijing and Tokyo.,“Here, and it was the same in Tokyo, young, up-and-coming athletes are dominating the podium. This is tremendous for the Paralympic Games and the Paralympic Movement,” he said.,Spence said the Paralympics have been getting more coverage on TV in the last two decades, inspiring a new generation of para athletes to take on new adventures. At the time of the 2030 Games, for which Sapporo has a strong chance to win the bidding, interest will have increased even more.,“Huge credit needs to go to our National Paralympic Committees and International Federations for developing such talent,” Spence said.,The start of a new Paralympic cycle offers a fresh chance for individuals and nations to look ahead and identify talent. Most countries attempt to develop systems that identify gifted athletes and promote their development.,After the unprecedented Tokyo Games postponement and the quick turnaround for Beijing, the Olympic and Paralympic circus will return to taking place every two years, starting with Paris, in the summer of 2024. Milan-Cortina in Italy will host the 2026 Winter Games.,Looking ahead to a possible time when it is again a Paralympic host, Japan needs to set more ambitious plans to boost the nation’s winter sport talent pool and secure the future of Paralympic sports at home.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo, AFP-Jiji,The Beijing Paralympics wrapped up Sunday after nine days of sport that focused the world’s attention on the plight of Ukraine’s athletes and their calls for peace in their homeland while putting the planet’s most accomplished disabled winter athletes at center stage.,Andrew Parsons, president of the International Paralympic Committee, declared the event finished and praised the athletes as “champions of peace” at the capital’s National Stadium.,
,The closing ceremony at the Bird’s Nest marked the end of a Winter Games that featured more than 560 athletes from 46 countries and regions in 78 medal events across six sports.,Japan’s Momoka Muraoka established herself as her nation’s Alpine skiing queen when she won three gold medals in China.,With Muraoka adding a silver, Taiki Kawayoke one gold and Taiki Morii two bronze, Japan finished with seven medals. The four-gold total is the most the country has won at a single games since the 12 it earned as host in 1998.,Before competition had begun, athletes from Russia and those from Belarus were sent home for their nations’ involvement in the Ukraine war, with the IPC forced to shift its position in the face of backlash from its original decision to allow them to compete under the Paralympic flag.,The IPC said its hand was forced when the safety situation in the villages became “untenable.” The fact many athletes and teams refused to take the field of play alongside athletes from aggressor states played a large role in the narrative changing.,The games opened March 4 with Parsons setting the games’ anti-war tone at the opening ceremony when he bellowed an impassioned “Peace!” at the end of his address.,While inclusion and diversity are always central to the Paralympic mission, “It was appropriate to send this message of peace … and that’s the message that we want the world to hear from the Paralympic movement,” he later said.,Calls for an end to the war in Ukraine were also widely heard from athletes, especially in Zhangjiakou where Ukrainian biathletes and cross-country skiers put themselves front and center when dedicating medals to their conflict-hit homeland and asking for global support.,After making a complex journey to reach China, the Ukraine team bagged 29 medals, including 11 gold, the highest ever for the eastern European country, to finish second on the medal table.,Despite having won just one medal at Winter Paralympics before the 2022 Games, China topped the medal table with 18 gold and 61 total medals. It achieved this momentous feat even with the entire Games being held in an isolated bubble due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.,Team Japan, featuring 29 athletes, competed in four sports — Alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, and snowboarding.,Muraoka, 25, dominated the headlines at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Beijing’s mountainous north, with gold in the sitting downhill, giant slalom and super-G taking her to four career Paralympic titles — the most of any Japanese winter athlete.,Her three gold medals also equaled the record for most won by a Japanese at a single Winter Paralympics.,Kawayoke, Japan’s 21-year-old flag bearer at the opening and closing ceremonies, won the men’s long distance classical technique standing cross-country event while Morii won two bronze medals in Alpine sit skiing.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

,The LDP’s prefectural chapter backed both Hase, a 60-year-old former House of Representatives member, and Shuji Yamada, a 67-year-old former House of Councillors member.,Hase, a professional wrestler-turned-politician, won the backing of former Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yoshihide Suga as well as Nippon Ishin no Kai.,His campaign platform included a 30% cut in the governor’s pay and a 50% reduction in retirement allowances for the post.,He will replace Masanori Tanimoto, 76, who has served as Ishikawa governor for seven consecutive four-year terms, the longest tenure for any incumbent prefectural governor in Japan.,Yamada was backed by most prefectural assembly members of the LDP as well as the prefectural chapters of two opposition parties — the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and the Social Democratic Party.

			,Fukushima Minpo,The March 2011 meltdown at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant caused serious damage to forests in the surrounding areas. Even now, 11 years after the accident, little has been done to decontaminate them.,In some areas, projects are underway to restore the ,, areas of mountain forest maintained by residents of adjacent communities, but the airborne radiation levels in those areas are still not low enough that children can safely enter, according to a local community leader.,
,One such area is the Yamakiya district in the town of Kawamata, Fukushima Prefecture. Walking trails in the Daini Oyako no Mori forest are covered by snow, and sunny slopes are lined with zelkova trees.,Yellow and pink vinyl wrapped around the trees indicates the year they were planted by local elementary school students. At the end of March, it will be five years since the evacuation order for the Yamakiya district was lifted. But even now, the voices of children have not returned to the mountains.,In 2016, satoyama restoration projects were launched in the prefecture to improve the forest environment. Decontamination, reforestation and radiation monitoring were carried out in an integrated manner in the mountain and forest areas that had been used by residents.,The projects have been carried out based on the comprehensive forest restoration policy for Fukushima Prefecture, which was compiled jointly by the Reconstruction Agency, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry and the Environment Ministry. A total of approximately 800 hectares in 14 municipalities were selected as model areas, including forest parks and walking trails, where fallen leaves and other sediment was removed and thinned.,
,
,In the past, the forestry club of Yamakiya Elementary School was active in Daini Oyako no Mori. But since the nuclear accident, the forest had not been cared for and was in a dilapidated state — with thickets growing over the planted zelkova trees.,The town and the local residents chose Daini Oyako no Mori as a site for the project in order to revive the area as a site where children could study forestry. The project was launched in December 2016, prior to the planned lifting of the evacuation order for Yamakiya district at the end of March 2017.,The project covers an area of about 2 hectares. In fiscal years 2016 and 2017, planted cedar and zelkova trees were thinned and cleared, and trees that had fallen due to snow were removed. Logs were spread on slopes as a measure to control topsoil runoff.,Decontamination work was conducted in fiscal 2018. Leaves and branches that had fallen to the ground and other accumulated organic matter were removed in areas covering 5,595 square meters of the forest, including an open square and walking trails. The zelkova trees could die if their surfaces were stripped, so the work focused on clearing the grass and thickets.,Comparing the radiation levels in September 2018, before the decontamination work, and in November the same year, after the work, the average radiation level in the open square had been reduced by 22%, to 0.69 microsievert per hour. Based on the result, the central government concluded that “the decontamination work contributed to creating an environment ready for the resumption of forest study activities.”,However, even after the decontamination process, the airborne radiation levels were far from the central government’s long-term target of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. At some monitoring points, radiation levels exceeded 1 microsievert per hour.,“The area is not ready for children to go back,” said Toshio Hirono, 71, leader of the Yamakiya Elementary School’s forestry club.,Residents are demanding that the forest, where children once enjoyed the greenery, be restored to its original state.,The forestry club, which did its main work in Daini Oyako no Mori, was known both within and outside of the prefecture for its progressive activities that took advantage of the abundant natural resources. At the entrance of the forest, a signboard notes a commemorative tree planting by the group to mark a national commendation they received.,Children belonged to the group in the fourth through sixth grade, and their activities were diverse. They processed thinned cedar trees to create a walking path in their school’s front yard, built bridges over a river and moat in nearby mountains and made a mallet by hand for pounding rice cakes. They learned about the importance of nature by collecting mushrooms and tara buds, and eating rice cakes kneaded with burdock leaves.,These activities came to a halt after the nuclear accident at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.’s Fukushima No. 1 plant. Before the accident, Yamakiya Elementary School had 30 to 40 children. But the number of children decreased due to the establishment of an evacuation zone, and the school has been closed since fiscal 2019.,“If it hadn’t been for the nuclear accident, there would have been so much more I wanted to do,” said Hirono.,Hirono has been serving as the third leader of the group for about 20 years, without a chance to pass on his position to a successor due to the suspension of its activities. He feels that although Daini Oyako no Mori has been decontaminated, the level of radiation has not gone down enough.,“If there is even a slight concern, we cannot allow our children to go into the mountains,” he said with a sigh.,Even after the model project ended, Hirono continues to voluntarily clear the undergrowth along the walking trails every fall. He understands that decontaminating all the forests in the town will not be easy, but believes that unless the radiation levels in the surrounding areas of Daini Oyako no Mori are lowered, residents will not be reassured.,“It is the central government’s responsibility to decontaminate until the residents are satisfied,” he said.,This section features topics and issues covered by Fukushima Minpo, the prefecture’s largest newspaper.

			,Kyodo,Families of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s asked U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel on Monday to help resolve the longstanding issue, saying little time is left for the aging families.,Members of the families’ group pleaded their case in the roughly one-hour meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, with Emanuel vowing continued U.S. support in resolving the issue, according to the Japanese government.,
,Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, who also attended the meeting as the Cabinet minister in charge of the abduction issue, asked the ambassador to convey their message to President Joe Biden, the government said.,The meeting followed a memorial gathering held Saturday for Shigeo Iizuka, who died in December at the age of 83 after serving for 14 years as the head of the families’ group. Iizuka’s younger sister Yaeko Taguchi was abducted by North Korea in 1978, and North Korea says she died in a traffic accident.,Iizuka was succeeded by Takuya Yokota, a younger brother of abductee Megumi Yokota who was kidnapped while on her way home from school at the age of 13 in 1977. Yokota’s father and the first leader of the families’ group, Shigeru Yokota, died in June 2020 at the age of 87 without ever being reunited with Megumi.,North Korea claims Megumi took her own life.,The past abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korean agents has been a major stumbling block for normalizing diplomatic ties between Tokyo and Pyongyang, along with the country’s nuclear and missile development.,The Japanese government officially lists 17 citizens as having been abducted by North Korea and suspects Pyongyang’s involvement in other disappearances of Japanese nationals.,Of the 17, five were repatriated in 2002 following a visit by then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s to North Korea. While Japan continues to seek the return of the remaining 12, North Korea maintains that eight have died and the other four never entered the country.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Prosecutors indicted a total of 34 individuals on Monday, including local assembly members in western Japan’s Hiroshima Prefecture, over vote-buying by former Justice Minister Katsuyuki Kawai for his wife in the 2019 Upper House election, reversing their initial decision.,Kawai has been convicted of handing out a total of ¥28.7 million to 100 local assembly members and supporters in his wife Anri’s constituency in Hiroshima in an attempt to buy votes.,
,In July 2021, prosecutors dropped the bribery case against all 100 individuals. But they overturned the decision after an inquest panel comprised of citizens said in January that 35 people should be indicted.,Among the 34 whom prosecutors took action against, nine were indicted without arrest, while 25 faced summary indictments. Prosecutors did not bring charges against the 35th person, a Hiroshima Municipal Assembly member who suffers from ill health.,If the local assembly members who were indicted Monday are found guilty and their convictions are finalized, they would be stripped of their assembly seats and become ineligible to hold public office.,Kawai, who belonged to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was sentenced in June last year to three years in prison and a forfeiture of ¥1.3 million by the Tokyo District Court over the vote-buying.,His wife, Anri, was sentenced in January last year to a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for five years, for conspiring with her husband and giving ¥1.6 million in total to four Hiroshima Prefectural Assembly members. She lost her seat as her election win was nullified following the ruling.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kahoku Shimpo,A Vietnamese woman who lives in Miyagi Prefecture sent a message to the “letters from readers” section of the Kahoku Shimpo expressing a grievance. The letter explained that when she informed the Japanese-language school where she had been studying that she had to cancel her enrollment because of financial hardship stemming from the pandemic, she was about to pay a cancellation fee of ¥3 million, after being pressured by the school to do so.,The school said that it asks for such a fee to discourage students from quitting the school and switching to a work visa, but experts say the approach takes advantage of students’ weak position and is a violation of their human rights.,
,In November 2020, the woman, who is in her 30s, obtained a student visa, came to Japan and entered the Japanese-language school in Sendai’s Aoba Ward.,She planned to study Japanese for two years with a goal of becoming a nursing care worker in Japan.,But soon her plans began to unravel, as a restaurant she had been working at part-time was forced to shorten business hours due to the spread of COVID-19 and her income turned out to be much lower than expected.,Her savings of roughly ¥400,000 dried up in about six months, but the school asked her to pay tuition fees of ¥500,000 for the second school year.,Because she couldn’t make the payment, she told the school in June that she would quit, and the school responded by threatening that she would have to pay a cancellation fee if she was going to switch to a work visa.,According to a recording of a conversation between the woman and a school employee obtained by Kahoku Shimpo, the woman said she was in a tough financial situation and had no savings.,Then the staffer said: “In that case you will have to return to your country. We will ask you to pay ¥3 million if you switch to a work visa or another visa. If you are thinking it’s OK for you to change to a work visa, you are wrong.”,When the woman entered the school, she signed a written oath that states the signer will not switch from a student visa to a work or other visa arbitrarily and will comply with the rule of paying a cancellation fee of ¥3 million if the pledge is violated.,
,When asked by Kahoku Shimpo why there is such a rule, the school’s principal said: “It is intended to stop people from obtaining a student visa with the purpose of working (in Japan) and quitting the school immediately to get a job. If students switch their visa to a work visa or another visa, we won’t be able to maintain our business.”,But the principal said the school has abolished the rule, since there were no cases in which the school actually demanded that a student pay the cancellation fee.,
,
,The woman was expelled from the school and is currently working in Miyagi Prefecture.,Employees of other Japanese-language schools questioned the practice of asking for a cancellation fee.,“The cancellation fee payment rule is too excessive,” said Takahiko Yamada, head of Midream School of Japanese Language in Tokyo. “Students may feel pressure to push themselves hard by working long hours or going into debt so they can finance their tuition.”,Shoichi Ibusuki, a lawyer well-versed in issues related to foreign nationals in Japan, said, “It is a violation of human rights to restrict students with cancellation fee requirements.”,“Schools must be in a difficult situation, as entries of foreign students are limited amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but they should offer support to students, such as postponing the deadline for paying tuition, so that they can continue studying,” Ibusuki said.,
,The number of foreign students in Japan rose sharply after the government announced a plan in 2008 to increase the number to 300,000 by 2020.,Education ministry data shows that the figure rose from 160,000 in 2011 to 310,000 in 2019, achieving the government target a year early.,In particular, students from Vietnam — a lower-income country — increased significantly, rising from around 4,000 in 2011 to some 62,000 in 2020.,“We can’t deny that the government’s plan to increase foreign students was used as a way to secure cheap labor,” said Reiko Nebashi, a professor of communication studies at Meiji University’s Department of Information and Communication.,Nebashi describes the system of accepting foreign students as “an immigration side door,” in comparison to the front door for those coming with a work visa.,Foreign students who work for low wages often face financial difficulties. They come to Japan heavily in debt and pay admission fees and tuition to Japanese-language schools.,They are constantly struggling with these difficulties and the risk of being deported if their student visa is not renewed.,There are cases of foreign students being abused by unsupervised brokers or at workplaces.,“It would be too harsh to say foreign students should take on the responsibility themselves,” Nebashi said. “It is necessary for the Japanese side to change its perception of foreign people as cheap labor and call students’ attention to possible risks.”,This section features topics and issues from the Tohoku region covered by the Kahoku Shimpo, the largest newspaper in Tohoku.

			,Momoka Muraoka was denied her third gold of the Beijing Paralympics on Monday when her German rival Anna-Lena Forster came from behind to win the women’s sitting super combined.,Forster, who was beaten by the Japanese in the downhill and super-G sitting events over the past two days, finally got her gold when she finished 0.77 second ahead of Muraoka, with Liu Sitong of China skiing to bronze.,
,Muraoka topped the super-G phase of the competition early on Monday, building a 6.07-second buffer over Forster, but the German’s aggressive ski in the slalom saw her clock a time 6.84 seconds faster in the more technical of the two races that make up the super combined event.,Muraoka, who won gold in the giant slalom at the 2018 Paralympics in Pyeongchang, still has the slalom and giant slalom skiing events remaining at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre.,If she can win one more gold in China, she will become the first Japanese to collect four career Winter Paralympic titles. She will also equal the record for the most gold medals won by a Japanese athlete at a single Winter Games.,Forster has now won one gold and two silver at the Beijing Games to take her career tally to eight medals, the same total as Muraoka.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Debutant Paralympic snowboarder Masataka Oiwane was all smiles after a bittersweet eighth-place finish in the men’s snowboard cross on Monday in China.,Considered an authority on snowboard equipment and maintenance among his teammates, Oiwane brought his own special board wax to the competition venue near Beijing, and some of his teammates used it in pursuit of the Paralympic podium.,
,Six Japanese men competed in snowboard cross events in Zhangjiakou, a significant increase from the 2018 Pyeongchang Paralympics where only three raced.,None were able to win a medal, but they put up a good showing with all but one of the six reaching a semifinal.,The team members think Oiwane’s wax played a part in that success.,“The wax I brought here is for conditions in which snow starts to melt,” the 41-year-old said. “I have been studying it for four years, and I believe what I have been doing is effective on the world stage.”,Oiwane’s teammates told reporters they believe his wax allowed them to shave off tenths of a second in the qualification rounds, giving credence to his claims.,The Tokyo resident used to dream of becoming a motorcycle racer, but a 1997 accident shattered that aspiration. The motorbike crash left Oiwane needing to have his right arm amputated at the shoulder.,After his recovery, he was encouraged by his employer to get involved in snowboarding and began in 2001. However, he stepped away from the sport due to the lack of competitive events for riders with disabilities in Japan at the time.,Instead, Oiwane turned to para golf and competed at the national level in Japan, but he could not shake his snowboarding ambition.,When he returned to the snow, he found himself at a disadvantage to other riders as he had limited training time due to his full-time work responsibilities. So he began looking for other ways in which he could gain an advantage.,“I started studying about wax and other gear to narrow the gap between myself and other snowboarders,” he said, detailing how he came up with unique ways to lay down and manipulate the wax on the base of his snowboard to suit various snow conditions.,Oiwane explained after the qualification round that a snowboard is seriously affected by dust on its base, with any impurities or dirt causing it to glide very poorly.,As temperatures increase in China’s mountains in March, yellow sand and dust from beneath the snow has increasingly become exposed. Foreign substances penetrating the wax will, quite literally, put the brakes on a snowboard, Oiwane said.,Keiji Okamoto, 40, has said the snow conditions and temperatures are very different from what Japan’s athletes expected based on information they received from the Olympics in February.,Even if they did not have the best intelligence before the event, communication within the Paralympic team on the ground is better than ever, they said.,Oiwane, now respected as the team’s “wax master,” may not have trained the members with his personally-developed “wax on, wax off” techniques, but the family-like atmosphere of the Japanese team makes him open to sharing whatever technical knowledge he has.,“We have built a relationship which allows everyone to give some advice to anyone,” said Junta Kosuda, 31.,With their team spirit and snowboards all tuned to perfection, their eyes now turn to the next events — the men’s banked slalom that comes later in the games.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,While the Beijing Olympics encountered freezing temperatures reaching minus-28 degrees at skiing competition venues, the Paralympics are facing the opposite issue — the risk of snow melting due to the arrival of warmer weather.,Skiing on home turf, Chinese para Alpine skier Liu Sitong has won two bronze medals in women’s sitting events in Beijing so far, but said the condition of the snow was not as good as at the start of the games.,
,“You see a lot of athletes have failed to finish. It’s because this type of snow is still different to what we’re used to skiing on,” said Liu.,The rising temperatures prompted organizers to bring forward the super combined competitions by a day to Monday at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Center, where temperatures hovered around 5 degrees at the speed finish area.,“Yeah it was warm, like in the Caribbean sea,” Swiss Paralympic Alpine skier Theo Gmur joked after completing the men’s super-G standing event in the morning.,But Gmur dismissed concerns the weather and snow conditions had any bearing on his performance, saying, “I think it was okay for a super-G because on the top it is pretty speedy, pretty fast, so it was really good to ski.”,Gmur, a triple gold medalist at the Pyeongchang Paralympics in 2018, was second at the midway stage but disqualified in the slalom.,Japanese Alpine all-rounder Taiki Morii, who failed to finish in the slalom despite a strong start in the super-G sitting in the morning, said the slope used for technical races had better sunlight than the one for speed races, so “the snow melts then becomes hard.”,At the Yanqing Alpine ski course northwest of Beijing, the brown landscape of the Xiaohaituo mountain stands in stark contrast to the artificially-generated snow slopes.,With both the Yanqing and Zhangjiakou competition zones located in some of the driest parts of China, the Beijing Games has depended almost entirely on artificial snow as the real thing can be hard to come by.,The creation of snow is not a new concept for the global sporting event. Around 90% of snow used at the Alpine skiing venue for Pyeongchang 2018 was artificial, with man-made snow also deployed at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014, according to the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency.,But while many top-tier Paralympians competing at Yanqing have commented on the hardness and different texture of man-made snow, this has not proven a problem to those who enjoy a challenge.,“It’s more aggressive. But I like artificial snow more. If you turn your ski, it grabs you in, and then it goes faster than the normal snow, and I like it to be faster. It’s more challenging and the challenging slopes I like,” said Dutch Paralympic champion Jeroen Kampschreur.,Slovak visually impaired para Alpine skier Alexandra Rexova, who won gold in the women’s super-G together with her guide Eva Trajcikova on Sunday, agreed, saying the snow is “hard, but perfect. We really enjoy the snow in China, we think it’s better for us.”,Gary Smith, guide to visually impaired British Alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick, who has taken home silver and bronze so far, said the snow “grips up (and) runs well. You couldn’t ask for anything better to race down.”,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Para sit skier Taiki Morii says for him, bladder and bowel management is a more serious problem than the impairment he experiences in his legs.,For some of the 120,000 people with spinal cord injuries in Japan who are dealing with excretory dysfunction, including Alpine skier Morii, it is literally a matter of life or death.,
,“I want people to know those challenges are bigger than a loss of function in the legs,” Morii said.,The 41-year-old already had five medals from five previous Paralympics and won two more this past weekend in the first two of the five sitting Alpine events he plans on contesting in Beijing.,When he was 16, Morii sustained spinal cord injuries in a motorcycle accident. He began sit skiing after watching the Nagano Paralympics while hospitalized, and also took up para powerlifting competitively in 2018.,Morii’s spinal cord damage prevents correct nerve signals between his bladder and brain. Being unable to control his bladder is a particularly acute issue when on the snow.,“I’ve had to take medicine before competition because of a urinary tract infection,” he said.,Using a long-term indwelling urinary catheter, needed by people whose bladders will not empty fully or that empty involuntarily, was an option, but the discomfort hindered his sporting performance.,
,
,During the pandemic, his high body temperature also proved to be a roadblock. Temperature screening has become a normal part of life, and a body temperature of 37 degrees raises red flags in Japan.,“My normal body temperature has been in the 37 Celsius range all through my 20-year career. But now there’s the possibility of being denied entry to a gym or being unable to train overseas, so I became proactive about my health and had a checkup.”,Morii was diagnosed with chronic cystitis, a long-lasting inflammation of the bladder characterized by an inflamed or irritated bladder wall.,“I made some lifestyle changes by drinking better quality water and emptying my bladder at regular times,” said Morii, adding that he has not had any infection or fever issues since.,Morii’s physician, Osamu Uemura, the head of the rehabilitation department at Murayama Medical Center in Tokyo, said bladder dysfunction can be stressful to deal with for any patient, but especially for sportspeople.,“Urologic conditions among athletes are very troublesome,” he said.,According to the nonprofit Japan Spinal Cord Foundation, about 6,000 people are injured or diagnosed with a spinal cord injury every year in Japan. Uemura said some die from urinary complications.,Many people experience both bladder and bowel control problems. These conditions affect patients not only physically but emotionally.,It can be traumatic for a wheelchair user to experience bowel incontinence in public.,People who deal daily with bladder and bowel complications are said to experience a wide range of emotions, including fear, shame, embarrassment, guilt or the desire to isolate. Some avoid going out entirely or plan their activities around their proximity to a toilet.,Patients regularly share stories of traumatic incidents with Uemura, and he said one of his main concerns is helping them preserve their dignity.,“I learn about their living conditions and have them try different ways to deal with their situations through trial and error. I see that as the only way, slow but sure,” Uemura said.,Spinal Injuries Japan representative Shinya Ando is a 47-year-old man paralyzed from the shoulders down with a functional bowel disorder.,“I would get nervous every time I get on an airplane. I wouldn’t eat food for two days before a flight, it was so emotionally draining,” he said.,After careful consideration, Ando opted for a stoma surgery, where the doctor sews the anus closed and makes a small opening called a stoma in the skin of the lower abdomen for excretion of digestive and urinary wastes from the body into a bag.,Seeing the need for more information on how to improve people’s awareness of bladder and bowel health, Morii decided to offer education and support to those in need himself.,
,
,The Beijing Paralympian starred in a commercial for adult diapers delivering the message of “Rather than lament what we cannot do, let’s enjoy what we can.”,On YouTube, he has talked about how he manages his bladder and bowel functions, and how athletes like him, with conditions that impair this most normal of bodily functions, can have their day-to-day life impacted in unexpected and challenging ways.,Having such a vocal and inspiring spokesperson is making a difference, Ando believes.,“I’m so thankful that an influential figure is speaking out,” he said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,Having won two gold medals and one silver so far at the Beijing Winter Paralympics, Japanese Alpine sit skier Momoka Muraoka said Tuesday her desire to show her full potential on the slopes motivates her more than any rivalry.,“Of course I want to win against my rivals, but emotionally I feel stronger about skiing my best and in my own way,” Muraoka said at a news conference held at the athletes’ village in Yanqing.,
,“I’m happy I was able to improve my ranking and win gold in a competition that I couldn’t before,” the Japanese Paralympic team captain added.,Muraoka said leadership is not her natural forte, but she hopes to follow in the footsteps of her predecessors by being a good role model.,The Saitama Prefecture native expressed joy over team member Taiki Kawayoke winning Japan’s first men’s long-distance standing cross-country skiing gold on Monday, saying “We may be young, but we are doing well in our respective competitions.”,Also attending the press conference was fellow Alpine sit skier Taiki Morii, who was full of praise for Muraoka’s skills.,“When I saw her ski the downhill and super-G these games, I felt she did the world’s most beautiful turn, even compared with men. I feel really happy to have a younger teammate like this,” he said.,The 41-year-old is taking part in his sixth Winter Paralympics and seeking his first gold. He has won a medal at every games since 2006, maintaining the record at Beijing with two bronze so far.,With International Women’s Day falling on Tuesday, Muraoka said she hopes to see more women with disabilities take up sit skiing and not be daunted by the thought of heading into the mountains or using specialized equipment.,Only seven women competed in the downhill sitting event at the Beijing Games this year.,Muraoka, who won gold in the giant slalom at the 2018 Paralympics in Pyeongchang, still has the slalom and giant slalom events remaining at Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre.,While the 25-year-old admitted that the course for the technical races was difficult, she also expressed an eagerness to take on the challenge in the days ahead.,“(My performance) will be up to how well my body, emotions and gear can adapt,” she said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,Kyodo,The Beijing Paralympics have given athlete and special education teacher Shinji Tabuchi an ideal opportunity to put into practice one of the lessons he imparts to students inside the classroom — the need to embrace challenges.,The 40-year-old Paralympic debutant is competing as a snowboarder in the SB-LL2 sport class for athletes with an impairment in one or two legs with less activity limitation.,
,At age 26, Tabuchi suffered broken thighbones in a snowboard crash during dry land training. After spending four months in hospital and undergoing extensive rehabilitation, he was still left with functional problems in his right foot.,He took part in the first para snowboarding competition held in Japan in 2015 and was named to the national team the following year.,Tabuchi has since then balanced his teaching with his para snowboarding career. He believes it is a winning combination, letting his students see their teacher in a new light.,“You all helped me get to the dream stage. I hope you will watch me take on the challenge and that it stirs up many emotions,” he said, addressing his 11th-grade students and colleagues at Wadayama Special Needs School in Hyogo Prefecture in a sendoff party held last month.,
,
,Tabuchi finished 12th overall in his first of two events at Zhangjiakou Genting Snow Park — the men’s snowboard cross SB-LL2 — which finished Monday. He hopes to get closer to the podium in the banked slalom on Saturday.,In banked slalom, each rider will race three times, with the quickest run winning. The course will feature a naturally varying terrain with plenty of bumps, dips, and a U-shaped valley.,In addition to teaching his specialist subjects like math and ethics, Tabuchi, who was a general education teacher before he moved to his current school in April 2020, supports the personal development of two students with physical and intellectual disabilities.,“I love my teaching job and I love my students,” he said.,His colleagues can vouch for his character and teaching expertise, and high school director Yuka Yoshimoto says Tabuchi is great at using sport activities like table tennis and boccia to motivate students.,Tabuchi rarely shows his athlete side when he is at school. He feels bad about having to leave for domestic and overseas training camps, but his fellow teachers are supportive of his dual career and give him a hearty send-off every time.,With or without a medal, they hope Tabuchi will come back with powerful life lessons his students cannot learn from reading books.,“Our foremost wish is that he comes back with no regrets,” Yoshimoto said.,In a time of both misinformation and too much information,, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.,By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.,With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

			,REUTERS,For Ukrainian athletes at the Beijing Paralympics, a time that should have been the pinnacle of their sporting lives has instead been a grueling emotional examination amid fear and anxiousness about Russia's invasion of their country.,The Ukrainian team has excelled in Beijing — winning eight gold medals — but standing on the podium has been overshadowed by the crisis back home.,
,""It's super difficult,"" said Taras Rad, who has won two medals in biathlon. ""Nobody can get any sleep. You have your phone beside you and you can't help but scroll to know what's happening.,""And when you do get some sleep, you're so worried that you wake up in the middle of the night … every time I go back to the (Olympic) village, first thing I do is call up my family."",Grygorii Vovchynskyi said his bronze medal in Wednesday's sprint free standing event was as good as a gold.,""I've been giving it all for my country,"" he said. ""I represent Ukraine. I love Ukraine. Given everything that's been happening, this is my gold medal.,""We have to stick together, stay strong. We are speaking with family and friends on the ground there everyday and they tell us to concentrate on the competition, but it's not so easy."",The Ukrainian team extended its support to biathlete Anastasiia Laletina, who withdrew from two events after her father, a soldier in the country's army, was captured by Russian troops.,""We're not celebrating our medals because of everything that's happening … we want peace in Ukraine,"" said Oksana Shyshkova, who secured silver in the women's sprint free visually impaired class on Wednesday.,""They are bombing (civilian) buildings and people are getting killed every day. All of us have families back there … we just don't know what to do. We're really scared. There are little children there."",Russia denies firing on civilian targets in Ukraine.,It is still uncertain whether the athletes will be able to return home after the Games — the delegation plans to fly to Poland and then try to get to Ukraine.,""I want to go to my family, my friends, my daughter. I want to go home.
