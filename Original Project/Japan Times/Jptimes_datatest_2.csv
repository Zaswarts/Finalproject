"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","One of the most intriguing tools the United States has used to head off an invasion of Ukraine is the publication of intelligence reports about Russian intentions."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","The Biden administration has provided formerly-classified intelligence to allies and media around the world, showing Russian troop formations and revealing purported “false flag” operations — an attack staged by Russian troops disguised as Ukrainian forces — that would be used to justify an intervention."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","The U.S. strategy is not unprecedented, but it is risky. There is the danger of exposing sources, of damaging U.S. credibility, or of signaling that the protection of intelligence is less important than it really is. If the policy works and an invasion is deterred, it will have been worth it — even though we will never know if the exposure actually changed Russian calculations."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","In recent weeks, the U.S. has released a startling amount of information about Russian plans involving Ukraine. Not only has the Biden administration published photographs that show in detail concentrations of Russian troops and equipment, but it has also released intelligence intercepts that lay out plans for a “false flag” operation and even information from Russian sources complaining about the leaks."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","The U.S. campaign has multiple audiences. Its first target is Russian President Vladimir Putin. He is being informed that his principal adversary knows his plans and tactics and will not be surprised. He must now wonder what other secrets might be in jeopardy. That might deter him from acting."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","A second target is the Russian public. They are being given a narrative that counters the story fed to them by official state media. It is a tough sell but it could undermine support for Putin."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","A third audience is allied and partner governments that might harbor doubts about Russian plans and intentions. The intelligence will help shore up support for efforts to check Putin."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","The fourth audience is the U.S. public. It needs to know what is going on in Ukraine and be prepared for any consequences. There are divisions in the U.S. about the wisdom of defending Ukraine, the product of political polarization and active disinformation campaigns, and the Biden administration must do more to build support for its effort to deter Putin."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","Shining a light on such plans is not unprecedented. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson famously exposed the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962, winning a seminal propaganda battle at the height of the Cold War. Secretary of State Colin Powell sought to strike a similar blow in 2003 when he presented to the U.N. the U.S. evidence that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was trying to build weapons of mass destruction; that effort failed when the intelligence was exposed as shoddy and poorly vetted."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","Reporters who remember Powell’s disgrace have raised questions about the recent campaign, and the response has been tetchy. The Biden administration has not released proof of its claims, and instead complained about the media’s readiness to doubt its credibility, and that of allied governments, and “find solace” in Moscow’s denials. Ironically, today’s U.S. government spokespersons challenged similar revelations during the Trump administration. But as Secretary of State Antony Blinken explained at the United Nations this week, the U.S. is releasing its information “not to start a war but to prevent one.”"
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","Still, skepticism is understandable. There has been the episodic politicization of intelligence. In addition to the Iraq case, the Trump administration several times released information that bolstered its hand in domestic political disputes. The selective declassification of intelligence for political ends, rather than national security, is a dangerous habit to indulge in. Not only does it undermine a government’s credibility but it encourages others to also play fast and loose when they have access to restricted information."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","The legal status of such disclosures is very different — the executive can declassify information as it sees fit, assuming procedures are followed — but leakers are less inclined to focus on the bigger picture and more on winning the rhetorical fight. This is a vitally important lesson for Japan as it works to create new procedures to handle classified information."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","There is also the danger that release could jeopardize sources. There are open-source satellite photos, for example, that reinforce U.S. claims. But more is needed to answer critical questions of intent. Truly insightful intelligence comes from unique assets that should be protected at all costs. That is why the U.S. has not released the actual proof of its assertions. The distinctiveness of the information means, however, that the source might be identified without hard proof — although there is also a chance that publication could create doubts within Moscow about spies and loyalties."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","In this case, publication makes sense, however. If the intelligence is accurate, then exposure undermines Russian plans to provide a casus belli. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, there was little understanding of the role played by surreptitious operators on the ground — the “little green men” who pressed for separation from Ukraine and reunification with Russia, ostensibly independent actors who were in reality Russian soldiers stripped of insignia."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","The use of such tactics, which includes disinformation campaigns, is known as “gray zone warfare,” so called because it falls short of requiring a traditional military response. These tricks have a long history and have engendered debates among governments about how to respond. Those discussions have assumed new urgency as adversaries become more adept at these new forms of warfare."
"How to stop a Ukraine war before it starts","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/18/editorials/stopping-ukraine-war/","","","For some, the passing of the Feb. 16 deadline without an invasion will show the U.S. was wrong, its intelligence unfounded and all was just an attempt to slander Russia, as Moscow’s spokesmen have insisted. For others, Russian inaction is proof that the warnings worked and Putin was deterred. Speaking at the U.N., Blinken said he would be happy to be proven wrong. Uncertainty and even some embarrassment seems like a reasonable price for peace."

Since taking office, the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of events have kept Kishida from making that trip. The July Upper House election and the U.S. midterm elections in November will preoccupy both leaders and threaten to further delay any visit."

The deal will permit 1.25 million metric tons of steel shipments from Japan — most of its exports to the country — to enter the U.S. tariff free and will facilitate greater cooperation between them to counter Chinese practices that hurt the steel industry. The agreement is similar to one struck last year with the European Union; Japan had held out for a more comprehensive deal.

Russia itself is geopolitically weak in the region. Only a fifth of its population lives in the vast Siberian space between the Ural Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Russia’s ability to project hard power in East Asia is limited. It is unlikely to repeat the asymmetric tactics it has used against Ukraine and other neighboring post-Soviet countries, because borders in East Asia are more fixed and agreed-upon than in Eastern Europe. Putin is also mostly concerned with European-area disputes. His goal in Asia seems primarily to maintain good relations with China while he tangles with NATO."

Japan is in a long-running territorial dispute with Russia over the Kuril Islands. There is some similarity there to Russia’s many territorial disputes along its European borders. But Russia already controls the four islands in dispute, so there is no obvious revanchist threat. That “frozen conflict” seems likely to remain frozen."

In just three years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia shed two layers of empire — the Eastern European “allies” of the Cold War-era Warsaw Pact, like Poland and Romania, and then the Soviet Union’s own non-Russian nations, such as Lithuania and Ukraine, which also became independent."

"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","Putin has fought this by arguing that Ukraine is not really a country at all. It is historically a part of Russia, his argument goes, and that its post-Soviet independence is an inexplicable happenstance. And just as in Eastern Europe, this belligerence and imperial nostalgia is now fueling a counter-reaction in flourishing Ukrainian nationalism."

"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","Additionally, the United States is committed to Taiwan far more than the West is to Ukraine. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and it is unlikely to become one. Western publics strongly oppose direct military intervention and war against Russia.

"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","Taiwan is different. Although it has no formal alliance with the United States, it has a long-standing American relationship and wide sympathy both in the U.S. foreign policy community and among U.S. regional allies. Everyone realizes that a Chinese move on Taiwan would be a major revision of the Asian order that has ensured peace and prosperity for decades. The Taiwanese would fight hard; they are better prepared than Ukraine; the Americans would probably join; regional U.S. allies, most obviously Japan, would probably get involved as well."

If China’s leaders reject sovereignty and borders as Putin has done in Eastern Europe, it risks opening ideological space for China’s many minorities to demand rights or succession. Bullying Taiwan into “voluntary” unification is its ideal outcome."
"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","For sure, China has engaged in salami slicing tactics in the South China Sea — grabbing islets and shoals, building bases on them, and declaring air and maritime control zones. This is also troublesome, but far less important than moves on Ukraine or Taiwan, which are densely populated land masses. The stand-off over the South China Sea will continue, but it is different enough from Putin’s rolling land-grabs to mean that Ukraine is likely not a model there."
"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","The real issue is Taiwan. China, like Russia, has ginned up fake narratives about the dispute. It lies to its own people about the desire of Taiwanese to “rejoin” China, but that has been unpersuasive. It is quite clear the Taiwanese value their democracy more than unification. Otherwise unity would have happened long ago."
"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","The core concern, rather, is deterrence. Do the Chinese believe the Taiwanese, Americans and others will fight for Taiwan? And here the regional differences and particulars of the dispute matter a lot. Ukraine’s subversion, while tragic, is not seen as an existential challenge to the European order. An invasion of Taiwan would be, though, because it would be a massive military operation — given Taiwan’s island geography — by a power far larger and more capable than Russia. So the likelihood that the United States and its allies would fight is much higher; hence deterrence is stronger, blunting the notion that China will learn from Ukraine that it can freely attack Taiwan."
"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","Finally, it should be noted that Putin’s strategy is self-limiting.

"Will the Ukraine crisis upend political ambitions in Asia?","https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/02/26/commentary/world-commentary/ukraine-crisis-asia-impact/","","","A Chinese conquest of Taiwan or other nationalistic people in Asia would be costly, and China already spends more on internal than external security. The cost-benefit of Putin’s invasion is balance-negative — apart from the nationalist satisfactions — and the Chinese leadership has always been much more cautious about such things than risk-taking Putin."

My analysis of his actions was always based on the assumption of his rationality. There was always something to gain, a manageable risk of losing. Perhaps I was wrong from the start. Perhaps Putin has changed in recent years as his close circle narrowed and negative selection expelled people with a broader vision from the ranks of his advisors. Quite likely, Ukraine has long constituted an exception from Putin’s rationality, as most of its people time and time again chose the Western path, away from Putin’s vision of the Russian World."

It was performed on the third day of the third lunar month. Farmers and villagers eager for fertile fields and abundant harvests would make simple paper dolls to which they would “attach” their worries, then float the dolls (and the trouble attached to them) down streams swelling with melting snow."

The thrifty-minded merchants of old Edo began saving their dolls, displaying them each year in lieu of sending them downstream. There are still a few places in Japan where the custom of nagashi-bina (literally, “float away dolls”) persists."

Today, the Hina Matsuri (Doll Festival) combines a display of dolls with a gathering to celebrate the health of young girls on March 3."

And those individuals arriving from countries where the highly contagious omicron variant of the virus is “under control” will be exempted from quarantining at a designated facility altogether.

If your test is not one of these, you won’t be allowed to board the plane — let alone pass through the numerous checks on arrival in Japan. You will also need an official MOFA testing form filled out by a medical professional. This can be very difficult to secure and seems to be the bane of many travelers, though my own experience went smoothly. Spend time researching testing companies."

The day before I left for the airport, I took a trip to the supermarket to buy some staples for my stay. I’m a vegetarian and had heard tales of small portion sizes and unexciting meals served during quarantine. I stocked my bag with snacks to nibble on throughout the day including vegetarian frankfurters, biscuits, crackers and potato chips. One thing I overlooked, but recommend packing, is any medication you need (with a copy of your prescription) or over-the-counter items to help with upset stomachs and the like."

The washrooms are taped off, so make sure to go before the plane lands. What seems like dozens — maybe hundreds — of staff line the route, many of them security guards."

The process has, thankfully, been streamlined after outrageous reports of passengers spending upward of six hours trying to enter the country. Still, it took about four hours from landing at Haneda to arriving at my hotel. Keep your hand luggage to a minimum, bring snacks, a drink and something to read.

This process involves spitting into a plastic vial in a cordoned off part of the airport, where photos of lemons and umeboshi (pickled plums) cheerfully look down at you to help get the salivary glands going.
